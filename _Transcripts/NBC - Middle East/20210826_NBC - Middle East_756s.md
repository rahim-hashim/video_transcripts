# McMaster: Kabul Blasts Are What Happen 'When You Surrender To A Terrorist Organization'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY)
*  Joining me now is Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor to President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump, of course, who also served as commander of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=4.9s)]
*  in Kabul and has detailed knowledge of all of this going back years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=9.3s)]
*  Thank you so much, General McMaster, for being with us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=16.18s)]
*  Let's talk first of all about the situation on the ground, your reaction to these explosions, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  the likelihood that it is ISIS-K, and how it impacts the evacuation effort. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=23.72s)]
*  Well, thanks, Andrea. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=29.62s)]
*  As you know, this was predicted and it was very predictable that this was going to occur. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=30.62s)]
*  This is actually what happens when you surrender to a terrorist organization like the Taliban. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=34.5s)]
*  And I think what's important to recognize is that this is just the beginning, Andrea. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=40.54s)]
*  We now have jihadist terrorists in control of a state. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=44.66s)]
*  And that is a win not only for the Taliban, as narrowly defined, but also to al-Qaeda, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=47.78s)]
*  to ISIS-K and other jihadist terrorist organizations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=53.46s)]
*  We tried too hard, Andrea, and I was listening to your reporting, to disconnect the dots. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=56.56s)]
*  These groups share people, resources and expertise. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=61.28s)]
*  Siraj Haqqani, who is the military commander of the Taliban, is a prominent al-Qaeda leader [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=65.4s)]
*  and is also the leader of the Haqqani network, the network that is at the nexus between al-Qaeda, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=71.36s)]
*  the Pakistan's inter-services intelligence and the Taliban. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  He was the main protector of Hamza bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's son, as he fought in command [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=81.72s)]
*  of Taliban forces. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=87.6s)]
*  So this is a ridiculous idea that this is really ISIS-K and, gosh, the Taliban must [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=89.28s)]
*  be really disappointed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=93.92s)]
*  That's crazy, I think, Andrea. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=94.92s)]
*  I'm sure that we will uncover evidence that this happened with the full knowledge of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=96.76s)]
*  Haqqanis and certainly elements of the Taliban, if not the most senior leadership. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  It has all the hallmarks of a complex attack of the kind that the Haqqanis are expert at, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=107.56s)]
*  right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  The Haqqanis are expert at two things, taking people hostage and committing mass murder [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  attacks of this scale. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  And so they are in charge now, and this is what happens when you surrender to jihadist [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=119.16s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=123.88s)]
*  General McMaster, let me just drill down on that, because Haqqani also has al-Qaeda connections. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=124.88s)]
*  So there are overlaps here, and it is true that ISIS-K has been active, and they are, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=132.44s)]
*  of course, adversaries of the Taliban. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=138.24s)]
*  So could you sort through that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=140.26s)]
*  But I was going to ask you, in fact, about the fact that Haqqani, who's on the FBI most [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=141.92s)]
*  wanted list, was, by the Taliban, put in charge of some security in Kabul just last week and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=146.54s)]
*  showed up at Friday prayers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=153.78s)]
*  Yeah, all security in Kabul. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=155.6s)]
*  He's in charge of security in Kabul. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=157.8s)]
*  He's the one who's dictating the terms to us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=159.2s)]
*  We can't and can't do outside the airport, and we don't have the will to really do what's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=161.32s)]
*  necessary to get all U.S. citizens out, as well as the Afghans, who are clamoring for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=166.04s)]
*  evacuation because they know that they've just been thrust into hell, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=170.72s)]
*  And so I think what's important to note is that these groups share people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=175.28s)]
*  I heard Richard's reporting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=179.36s)]
*  This isn't the ISIS of Syria and Iraq. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=181.28s)]
*  Some of them are, because all of those prisoners have been released now, by the way, and are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=183.82s)]
*  going to be a boon to jihadist terrorism broadly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=188.68s)]
*  But ISIS-K has members in it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  The members who formed it were from the Tariqi Taliban Pakistan, which is a splinter group [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  from Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which acts as an arm of Pakistan's foreign policy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=198.8s)]
*  So these groups change people and resources all the time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  And we have to recognize, I think, that this is just the beginning of a much more severe [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=208.24s)]
*  threat to all civilized peoples. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=214.56s)]
*  We have now handed the Taliban a nation state, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=216.64s)]
*  And that is a victory for them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=222.55999999999997s)]
*  It's a victory for al-Qaeda. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=223.72s)]
*  It's a victory for ISIS and other jihadist terrorists, 20 of which, 20 U.S.-designated [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=224.72s)]
*  terrorist organizations, are in the area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=229.44s)]
*  And what does control of that territory and resources give them? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  It gives them really a safe haven and support base. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=238.48s)]
*  Hey, where's our over-the-horizon capabilities now, Andrea? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=241.32s)]
*  That's a pipe dream. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  And so once we hand this territory over to them, they become orders of magnitude more [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  They've already declared victory over the United States of America, the world's only [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  superpower. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=255.12s)]
*  And they're using that to rally more and more people to their cause. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=256.12s)]
*  Remember, after Vice President Biden called then-President Obama in December 2011 from [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=259.36s)]
*  Baghdad, he said, thank you for allowing me to end this goddamn war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=265.4s)]
*  Well, hey, guess what? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=269.32s)]
*  Al-Qaeda in Iraq didn't look around and say, hey, the Americans are gone. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=270.88s)]
*  I guess we'll just stop. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  What they did is they redoubled their efforts to gain territory. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  They morphed into ISIS, which became the most destructive terrorist organization in history. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=278.48s)]
*  They recruited 30,000 fighters almost immediately, took over territory the size of Britain, and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=284.82000000000005s)]
*  then we had to return and wage a sustained campaign against them to deny them the use [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=289.92s)]
*  of territory. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  By the way, when they controlled that territory, they conducted over 200 attacks, many of them [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=297.88000000000005s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=303.18s)]
*  Some inspired in the United States. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=304.18s)]
*  They shot down an airliner. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=305.74s)]
*  They attacked the Brussels airport. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=306.74s)]
*  OK, so we are just seeing the beginning of what happens when you surrender to a terrorist [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=308.26s)]
*  organization. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=313.78s)]
*  Now, let me unpack this in part. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=314.78s)]
*  The Haqqani network is also, according to former Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=317.94s)]
*  Mullen and other experts, very closely connected with the Pakistan's intelligence service, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=323.06s)]
*  ISI. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=329.62s)]
*  So is Pakistan in some way, you know, covertly behind part of this? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=330.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=336.66s)]
*  And this is part of our self-delusion in Afghanistan, our serial gullibility. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  The Pakistan acts as the arsonist and then poses as the fireman. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=342.58s)]
*  And I think they have to pay the price for this now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=347.46s)]
*  They should suffer economic and diplomatic isolation to force them to make a choice, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=349.86s)]
*  right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=355.62s)]
*  Either as being as being treated as a responsible nation or and going after these groups less [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=356.82s)]
*  selectively or continue to be the major state sponsor of terrorist organizations. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=363.66s)]
*  And I think Pakistan should be faced with a future that looks like an isolated country [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=369.74s)]
*  with a single state sponsored China. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=374.06s)]
*  And you know what that looks like to me? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=375.86s)]
*  That looks like North Korea. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=377.46s)]
*  So that's what's in the future for the Pakistani government and the and the Pakistani people. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=378.86s)]
*  That ought to be our message. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=382.7s)]
*  But we always buckle, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=384.1s)]
*  I mean, President Trump, I think, put into place the first time, Andrea, we had a reasoned [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=385.54s)]
*  and sustainable approach on Afghanistan in August of 2017. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=390.58s)]
*  But the neo isolationist far right got in his ear, as well as I would call it, the self-loathing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=395.02s)]
*  far left and told him, you need to end this endless war. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=399.7s)]
*  Well, hey, wars don't end when one side disengages. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=402.9s)]
*  And the abandonment of that strategy and the coddling again of the Pakistanis. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=406.34s)]
*  I'll tell you, Andrea, when I saw Imran Khan after I left the job as national security [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=410.5s)]
*  adviser sitting in the Oval Office next to Donald Trump, I started to yell at the television. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=414.74s)]
*  And I think it's time for us to stop this self delusion. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=419.14s)]
*  Let me interrupt you on that, because let's talk about Donald Trump, because Donald Trump, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=423.86s)]
*  I don't know who's in his ear, but Donald Trump was in his ear in both ears because [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=426.5s)]
*  he did this deal with the Taliban. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=430.42s)]
*  Mike Pompeo cut this deal in February, March, February of 2020. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=434.06s)]
*  And they cut out the very weak Ghani government. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=441.38s)]
*  They had all their issues with Ghani's government in Afghanistan. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=446.06s)]
*  But they cut Afghanistan's government out of the whole negotiation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=449.06s)]
*  So wasn't that the original sin? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, I think you can say there's a number of original sins across all four [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=455.58s)]
*  administrations, especially, I would say, the last three. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=459.94s)]
*  So this is why this isn't a partisan problem, Andrea. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=462.41999999999996s)]
*  This is an American problem, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=465.34s)]
*  I mean, I want President Biden, and you know I'm not a partisan person. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  I want him to succeed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=470.78s)]
*  But to do that, we have to end our self delusion. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=472.38s)]
*  I would go back to 2009, when President Obama announced at my alma mater, West Point, a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=474.74s)]
*  reinforced security effort in Afghanistan, and then announced the timeline for our withdrawal [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=480.74s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=484.58s)]
*  And then said, OK, let's enter into negotiations with the Taliban. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=485.86s)]
*  And they formed this Taliban political commission in Qatar. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=488.5s)]
*  How does that work, Andrea? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=492.18s)]
*  How does it work when you tell your enemy that you're leaving and then you try to negotiate? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=493.5s)]
*  President Trump, I think, as you mentioned, after the abandonment of the August 2017 South [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=498.38s)]
*  Asia strategy, doubled down on those flaws. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=502.86s)]
*  And then President Biden doubled down on them again with, I think, what is clearly a failed [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=506.18s)]
*  effort, even if it was our mission only to withdraw. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=511.94s)]
*  And you know what's crazy, Andrea? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=514.74s)]
*  If we were just going to leave, why the hell didn't we just leave? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=516.9s)]
*  Why did we empower the Taliban on our way out? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=519.52s)]
*  Why did we cut the legs out from under the Afghan government by not having them in the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=522.22s)]
*  negotiations? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=526.78s)]
*  Why did we then insist that they release 5,000 of some of the most heinous people on Earth [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=527.98s)]
*  and went immediately back to terrorizing the Afghan people? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=532.9s)]
*  Why did we not insist on a ceasefire? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=536.26s)]
*  Why did then the Biden administration say, hey, we're leaving and we're leaving on [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=538.22s)]
*  this timeline? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=540.86s)]
*  You know, and of course, it turns out that the Afghan government, the Afghan security [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=541.86s)]
*  forces, really couldn't cope with those psychological blows that we're dealing to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=546.78s)]
*  them. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=551.74s)]
*  And of course, I thinkâ [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=552.74s)]
*  Well, do you think it's safe right now? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=553.74s)]
*  Generalâ [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=554.74s)]
*  Do Iâit's safe? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=555.74s)]
*  No, it's not safe. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=556.74s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I was going to say, do you think it's safe to resume evacuations or [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=558.5s)]
*  to extend the deadline? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  Is it safe enough to extend the deadline? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=564.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the conversationâ [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  I think the conversation that has to happen at the highest levels of our government is, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  what the hell is the mission, Andrea? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=572.98s)]
*  Is the mission just to get the hell out? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=574.96s)]
*  Or do we want to get all American citizens out? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=576.98s)]
*  Do we want to get all Afghans who will certainly be murdered or brutalized as soon as we depart? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=579.6s)]
*  We want to get them out, too. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=585.38s)]
*  If that's the mission, we need a much different plan than whatâthan what we're executing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=586.46s)]
*  now, and it can't be done on the existing timeline. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=590.22s)]
*  But if the mission is withdrawal on this timeline as an end in and of itself, hey, this is what [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=593.14s)]
*  we get. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=597.86s)]
*  And what we're seeing is the Haqqani network and the Taliban trying to humiliate us on [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=598.86s)]
*  the way out, so the images here are much worse than the images in Saigon in 1975. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=603.5s)]
*  But you know what, Andrea? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=609.26s)]
*  We're on fast forward to 1979 in Tehran and a hostage crisis. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=610.26s)]
*  And you know, unlike Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, when there was not one cell phone [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  in the country, we're going to be confronted every day with this brutality. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=620.6600000000001s)]
*  And what is the administration going to do then? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  What are those in the administration who came up with the right to protect doctrine going [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=627.62s)]
*  to say? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=631.4200000000001s)]
*  Are we just going to stand on the sidelines and watch mass executions and watch the horrors [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=632.4200000000001s)]
*  that we'll be forced to confront? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=638.58s)]
*  Let me just ask whether, you know, it's very clear that it's in the Taliban's interest [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=641.86s)]
*  to get the U.S. out. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=646.9s)]
*  They say so. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=648.66s)]
*  They want us out. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=649.66s)]
*  And that we're not going to leave, presumably, without getting the Americans out. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=650.9s)]
*  But doing this today, as we were wrapping up with a set deadline, how is it in their [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=655.74s)]
*  interest to be involved? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=661.5s)]
*  You know, I accept everything you're saying about the, you know, the Haqqani network, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=663.38s)]
*  But let's break down the fact that the Taliban does have an interest, a strong interest in [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=668.7399999999999s)]
*  getting the U.S. out of there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=675.7399999999999s)]
*  Andrew, Andrew, you've been subjected to these kind of statements from the administration, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=678.5s)]
*  and they are utterly ridiculous, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=682.78s)]
*  The idea that the Taliban acts in interest instead of acts based on their ideology. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=684.5s)]
*  Haybatullah Akhansada, the leader of the Taliban, his son was a suicide bomber employed in a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=689.54s)]
*  truck bomb against Afghan forces in Helmand Province in 2017. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=695.38s)]
*  I mean, what else do you need to know about him? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=699.7s)]
*  What else do you need to know about Siraj Haqqani? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=701.7s)]
*  I mean, it is as if we are just intent on mirror imaging. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=704.02s)]
*  And as a result of our strategic narcissism, right, our tendency to define the world only [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=709.02s)]
*  relation to us, and then assume what we decide to do is decisive, or not to do, decisive [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=714.02s)]
*  toward achieving a favorable outcome. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=718.9399999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=720.82s)]
*  We are facing real enemies there. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=721.82s)]
*  The enemies of all humanity. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=723.58s)]
*  And we have given them more authorship over the future than they deserve. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=725.18s)]
*  That's what we're confronting. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=729.78s)]
*  H.R. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=730.78s)]
*  McMaster, thank you very much, General. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=731.78s)]
*  Appreciate you coming today. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=732.78s)]
*  Thanks, Andrea. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=733.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=734.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=735.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyG017owjTY&t=736.78s)]
