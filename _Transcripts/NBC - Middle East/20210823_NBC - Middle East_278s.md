# 'A Dense And Dangerous Environment': U.S. Focused On Safe Passage To Kabul Airport
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY)
*  Tell me about something that you have received lots of hard questions about all last week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=0.0s)]
*  and over the weekend and today, which is the issue of safe passage out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=4.66s)]
*  Obviously, getting control of the airport, getting control of the tarmac, getting control [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=10.5s)]
*  of the runway, lining up these staging bases for onward movement, as you were describing, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=15.26s)]
*  all of that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=20.78s)]
*  We've seen the military sort of systematically get that in order. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=21.78s)]
*  And we have simultaneously seen the number of evacuees rise to this incredible number [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=24.86s)]
*  of nearly 11,000 in one 24-hour period just between Sunday and today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=29.74s)]
*  But there is still the front-end issue of how people get themselves into that safe system, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  how people get into the airport, how not just Americans, but people linked to the U.S. government, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=41.46s)]
*  people who are Afghan evacuees who we are otherwise going to prioritize how they're [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  going to get out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=51.9s)]
*  Tell me about big picture progress toward making more safe that part of their journey. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=52.9s)]
*  So there's a couple of pieces here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=59.2s)]
*  You might have heard me talk about this a little bit ago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=60.56s)]
*  We are in constant daily communication with Taliban leaders who are outside the airport. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=63.44s)]
*  And we have been making it clear to them what their credentials look like, who we want to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=69.12s)]
*  see get through their checkpoints, who are absolutely entitled to get on these flights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=73.6s)]
*  And thus far, though there have been certainly cases of harassment and even violent harassment [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=79.36s)]
*  of some qualified individuals. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=85.1s)]
*  By and large, these American citizens and these special immigrant visa applicants are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=87.22s)]
*  being able to work through those checkpoints. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=92.38s)]
*  We are also in communication with the Taliban about making it easier for a more safe perimeter [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=94.5s)]
*  around the field so that there are fewer crowds, because crowds have also been an impediment, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=103.42s)]
*  not from violence perspective, just from a dense perspective. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=108.06s)]
*  So we're working with them to try to make sure that there is enough access around the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  airport for people to get in more freely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=116.0s)]
*  And we are working every day. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=118.36s)]
*  Our commanders on the ground are pursuing opportunities to make access and passage to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  the field easier and safer for Americans and these S.I.V. applicants, some pretty creative [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  ideas that they're putting into place. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=131.76s)]
*  And obviously, it's a dense and dangerous environment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  We have a legitimate counterterrorism threat there, terrorism threat around the airport [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=137.34s)]
*  that we have to take seriously. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=142.52s)]
*  But once we get them onto the field, then they go through a whole series of processing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=144.0s)]
*  and manifesting, as I said, medical screening, make sure they have food and water. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  And we try to get them on the very next flight out that's available. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=152.32s)]
*  And these flights, at least yesterday, Rachel, they were leaving one almost every hour. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=156.04s)]
*  Now, we hope to be able to continue that sort of pace going forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=161.2s)]
*  Obviously, it's weather dependent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=164.5s)]
*  It's it's it's it's population dependent. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=165.82s)]
*  But that's the kind of that's the kind of throughput that we're trying to reach so [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=168.5s)]
*  that we can keep these numbers up for as long as possible. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=172.1s)]
*  Should we expect to see more evacuations, more transit to the airport aided by U.S. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=176.46s)]
*  helicopters? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=184.54s)]
*  Now, you have talked about this a little bit at the end of last week and also today that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=185.54s)]
*  there have been a couple of helicopter borne U.S. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  affiliated U.S. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=193.0s)]
*  facilitated movements, one from a group that was very close to the airport and another [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=194.4s)]
*  that was described as elsewhere in Kabul. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=198.84s)]
*  Should we expect there to be more of those? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=200.8s)]
*  That obviously seems like a sort of tidy answer to it from from those of us looking from this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=203.0s)]
*  distance or is there something that's particularly dangerous about those helicopter airlifts [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  that we don't understand? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  That means that that will continue to be quite limited. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=212.44s)]
*  Well, the commanders on the ground certainly have the authorities they need to pursue opportunities [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=214.72s)]
*  to bring people in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=219.0s)]
*  And one of the means that their disposal is, of course, rotary aircraft helicopters. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=220.0s)]
*  And we have done that on a couple of occasions. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=224.1s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't rule out that we would do it again if it if it was the best way. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=226.5s)]
*  And that's really what it comes down to, Rachel, is what's the best, most effective and what's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=230.86s)]
*  the safest way to get Americans and other S.I.V. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=234.66s)]
*  applicants into the airport? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=238.5s)]
*  And so, again, sometimes helicopters are the answer, sometimes not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=240.22s)]
*  And they're pursuing all kinds of different opportunities to make this happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=243.66s)]
*  So I certainly wouldn't rule it out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=248.0s)]
*  But it is it is not the only way in which we are encouraging and trying to facilitate [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=250.0s)]
*  the safe passage of people into the airport. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEL0umD9VY&t=255.08s)]
