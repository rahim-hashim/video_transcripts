# Israel official: 'Very likely' Hamas chief Sinwar is dead
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04)
*  Richard, just, and I just keep thinking about this, your deep, profound knowledge of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=0.0s)]
*  region and of the organizations and of the players that have had an impact on this for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  so many years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=15.94s)]
*  What are you thinking right now if Senoar is indeed dead? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's a chance to de-escalate. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=26.16s)]
*  We will see. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=28.4s)]
*  Leaders do matter in organizations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=29.4s)]
*  Leaders mattered, as we've seen in Hezbollah with the death of Nasrallah, dealt a serious [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=32.12s)]
*  blow to the organization. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=37.04s)]
*  Senoar's leadership matters in Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  Negotiators were not able to take decisions without him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  Senoar didn't use cell phones, only communicated directly through a handful of personal contacts [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  and attendance. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=52.8s)]
*  It made communications with him extraordinarily slow, extraordinarily difficult. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=53.92s)]
*  The Israelis had thought that they'd killed him several times before or that he died, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=58.6s)]
*  perhaps injured in another attack that they didn't even realize because he would disappear [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  for long periods. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=67.2s)]
*  They believed that they saw him or saw evidence that he had been someplace when Israeli troops [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=68.62s)]
*  found bodies of six hostages who'd been executed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=76.92s)]
*  That was in the Tel Sultan neighborhood in Rafah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  It's an area that I've been to. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  I was taken there by the Israeli military. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=84.56s)]
*  It is completely destroyed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=87.0s)]
*  There is not a single building standing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=88.68s)]
*  It looked like a ghost town. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=90.68s)]
*  The only signs of life we saw there, except for the Israeli soldiers who were with us, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=91.76s)]
*  were some stray animals that were climbing over the rubble. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=95.8s)]
*  If he had managed to stay in that area at that stage, he would have been with a very [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=99.6s)]
*  small group of people, indeed, likely trying to survive because transport in and out of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=105.44s)]
*  there was difficult. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=111.28s)]
*  It was completely occupied by roving Israeli troops. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  If, in fact, and there are some reports suggesting that he was, in fact, killed in that same [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=116.16s)]
*  neighborhood, it would suggest that he had limited ability to move, that his leadership [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=120.24s)]
*  role was coming to an end anyway, that the group was suffering a degree of division and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=125.56s)]
*  fracture because of the ongoing assault, all of which is going to be much worse now if [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=132.16s)]
*  it's in fact confirmed that Sinwar is dead. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=138.68s)]
*  It will be a blow to Hamas, a morale blow, a leadership blow, and obviously a big boost [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=141.08s)]
*  for Israel and for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  So, Chris, if there is that big blow against Hamas, what possibilities hope can there be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=151.4s)]
*  that Hamas can sit down on the negotiating table in Qatar or anywhere else and hammer [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=159.52s)]
*  out a ceasefire deal? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think the opportunity is open, but it really is dependent on who ascends to the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  leadership position. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  There are a few likely candidates, but one of them is Mohammed Sinwar, his brother, 13 [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=179.24s)]
*  years his junior, who is equally committed and arguably more violent in many ways. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=185.08s)]
*  The concern about Yahya Sinwar was he really understood the value of holding hostages. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=192.28s)]
*  And one of the reasons he wasn't ever likely going to turn them all back over because the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=199.32s)]
*  leverage that they provided and they gave him the opportunity to maybe survive this war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=205.8s)]
*  His brother knows that just as well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=211.96s)]
*  His brother was the chief architect of taking Galat Shalit back in 2006, which ultimately [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=214.6s)]
*  led to the release of Yahya Sinwar. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=220.36s)]
*  So I think it all depends on who ascends to the throne of Hamas, who will then be also [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=223.0s)]
*  a public enemy number one for Israel, and they'll start targeting that individual. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=230.28s)]
*  But leadership is what Richard talks about. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and I was just thinking, Richard, I mean, the brothers there, we don't know who the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  other two people that were killed along with, if it is confirmed that it is Sinwar who was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  killed yesterday in this firefight, this battle that Aaron tells us was indeed very intense. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=249.72s)]
*  What is the process for these organizations that are literally underground to come out and- [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=258.92s)]
*  Literally underground is a surprising thing out of all of this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=265.96s)]
*  Most intelligence estimates that I had read or heard about suggested that one of the reasons [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=269.32s)]
*  that Sinwar was so difficult to reach that he often dropped out of communications is that he was [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=277.16s)]
*  hiding in tunnels and had gone to ground and was waiting for the war to escalate, that the war [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=283.0s)]
*  moving into Lebanon would draw forces away from Gaza, would split the Israeli military [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=290.44000000000005s)]
*  to a northern and southern front, and that that would give him and Hamas more freedom to move and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  operate. That was the thinking for an intelligence report that I'd read. But the fact that he [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=306.04s)]
*  apparently was killed wearing, and the pictures I've seen, again, not confirmed, we'll wait until [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  we get the information confirmation, but the pictures circulating online that do look like him [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  shows him wearing a military-style jacket in a gunfight in a building above ground with apparently [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=321.16s)]
*  two other militants by his side that suggests someone who was not a mastermind hiding in a bunker [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=329.0s)]
*  was in the fight in the later stages of a fight engaging directly in gun battles, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=336.84s)]
*  someone who transitioned from leader to soldier to someone potentially fighting for his life. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=342.04s)]
*  And Chris, with every action comes reaction. It is the natural course of things, unfortunately, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=348.2s)]
*  in this case. What do you see as the reaction, Chris? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=354.2s)]
*  I think one of the things that I would be concerned about is some action against some of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=358.6s)]
*  the hostages to get some retribution. There is concern that the six hostages that were [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=363.88s)]
*  found just a few weeks ago, that they were deliberately killed to send a message, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=371.0s)]
*  because they are currency for Hamas. So they could be used in such a matter now, and so that would be [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=377.48s)]
*  concern. I think the other issue is a broader regional conflict. As Richard talked about, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=384.76s)]
*  this did not have the effect that Hamas hoped that if Israel broadened the war and went to the north [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=395.96s)]
*  and had to address some of the issues with Iran and the other surrogates in Yemen and Iraq, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=402.67999999999995s)]
*  that it would give them some freedom of movement and some latitude to do more in Gaza. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=409.88s)]
*  That hasn't happened. So what does Hamas do to try to regain some control and some leverage? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=415.24s)]
*  Will they look to carry out some other kind of attack if they have it within their capabilities? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=421.48s)]
*  I do think we'll know within the next few hours if this is Yaya Sinwar. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=427.24s)]
*  Israel has all of his biometrics from his previous detention. They likely have the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=432.6s)]
*  biometrics of the other two individuals that would have been with him when he was killed. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=437.96s)]
*  I think we'll know pretty quickly, and then they are likely doing rapid DNA as well, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=444.28s)]
*  which will give you positive identification for sure. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=449.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOLp9lfjG04&t=467.96s)]
