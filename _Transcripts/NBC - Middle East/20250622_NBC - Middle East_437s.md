# Iran’s leader ‘not very supreme’ after U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities: Middle East expert
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY)
*  Let's bring in Mark Polymeropoulos, former CIA senior intelligence officer and MSNBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=0.0s)]
*  national security intelligence analyst, and Ray Takei, former senior adviser on Iran at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=5.48s)]
*  the State Department and senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=10.4s)]
*  Relations. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=14.16s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you both. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=15.16s)]
*  Ray, you first. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=16.16s)]
*  I'm curious your reaction to this development. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=17.16s)]
*  And the secretary of state saying this was Iran's choice. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=19.6s)]
*  Well, what he's trying to suggest is that the president had offered Iran an opportunity [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=24.84s)]
*  to negotiate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=31.32s)]
*  There was even a couple of proposals exchanged. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=32.72s)]
*  All those proposals involved proscribing domestic enrichment, essentially abolishing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=34.92s)]
*  domestic enrichment, and they proved unacceptable to the Iranian regime. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  So in that sense, the secretary of state is correct in saying that there was a diplomatic [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=44.16s)]
*  path and an offer made, but that offer was rejected and the president proceeded with [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  an alternative course of action, as we have seen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=53.4s)]
*  So Mark, an Iranian retaliation, it can take many forms, one of which could be, say, a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=56.64s)]
*  cyber attack. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=62.36s)]
*  How prepared is the U.S. for one of those? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  And how great is the threat of Iran activating sleeper cells that may be here in the U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=66.48s)]
*  or abroad? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=71.8s)]
*  Well, the intelligence community is going to be certainly very focused on this, both [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=72.8s)]
*  domestically. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=78.76s)]
*  This is the Joint Terrorism Task Forces within the United States. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  This is led by the FBI and, of course, working with our foreign liaison partners. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=83.24s)]
*  Iran has a very sophisticated and longstanding terrorist apparatus. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=87.36s)]
*  It could be activated, and so we're really going to be on high alert to detect, deter [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  and disrupt any type of attacks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=96.6s)]
*  And this is what the intelligence community, the counterterrorism world is pretty good [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=98.64s)]
*  at. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=101.84s)]
*  On cyber, I think that the U.S. remains vulnerable in terms of attacks on infrastructure, on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=102.84s)]
*  And the Iranians have a fairly solid cyber apparatus. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=110.32s)]
*  And so all these possibilities are on the table. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=116.52s)]
*  And I think what the intelligence community is going to do and has done already is provide [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  kind of the range of assessments to the administration on what Iran could do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  The big question, of course, that you have alluded to over the last couple hours is, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=128.64s)]
*  what will Iran decide? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=134.4s)]
*  Secretary of State Rubio, President Trump and others have made it quite clear that any [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=137.36s)]
*  type of retaliation, particularly, I think, if it leads to American deaths, will be met [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=140.6s)]
*  with overwhelming force. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=144.68s)]
*  But I think we would be remiss not to be quite concerned right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's just, by the way, it's not the next just days and week ahead. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=149.68s)]
*  Retaliation could take place in the form of months or even a year plus, particularly terrorist [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=153.68s)]
*  attacks against U.S. interests abroad. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=158.36s)]
*  So there's a lot of work to do for the intelligence community. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=160.12s)]
*  As has been said, Iran has a long memory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  But let me ask you, to what extent are they right now capable of achieving any of these [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=165.36s)]
*  kinds of attacks? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=169.68s)]
*  And then what should they do? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  One, do you believe the U.S. response would be, Mark? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  So that's a great question, because there's a lot that's gone on inside Iran in terms [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=177.44000000000003s)]
*  of Israeli decapitation strikes against senior military and intelligence officials. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  There is obviously a pervasive fear that's going on within the Iranian security apparatus, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  because it's clear that Israeli intelligence has Iran penetrated in ways that I think has [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=193.76s)]
*  surprised a lot of us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=198.12s)]
*  So there is a question on capabilities right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=199.76s)]
*  Can there actually be communications between Tehran and overseas sleeper cells, for example? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=203.12s)]
*  We just don't know that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  You have to assume that they can. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  But I think if something doesn't happen, it might be because things are so absolutely [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=211.6s)]
*  degraded. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=215.64s)]
*  And again, I think one of the things that's going to decide any possible U.S. responses [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=216.64s)]
*  is frankly casualties on the U.S. side. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=220.0s)]
*  I know that sounds very grim. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=222.12s)]
*  But if Iran does something that's relatively symbolic, that does not lead to U.S. casualties, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  perhaps that would be it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=230.08s)]
*  But if Americans die, I think President Trump is going to be under a lot of pressure to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=231.08s)]
*  hit back and hit back quite strongly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=235.12s)]
*  Ray, talk to me about how damaging this war with Israel and now the U.S. strikes have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  been to the Iranian supreme leader, because you say he's been, quote, comprehensively [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=242.56s)]
*  humbled. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=248.0s)]
*  So what will his priorities be right now? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=249.0s)]
*  And could there be an internal threat to his leadership in the wake of all this? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=250.8s)]
*  Well, he has been comprehensively humble. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=256.24s)]
*  He had a strategy that prior to October 2023 looked like very successful. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  He had the rings of fire around Israel and what seemed to be quite capable of proxies. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  They're gone. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria has been quite detrimental to Iran [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=270.32s)]
*  because that was his land bridge to the Mediterranean. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=275.2s)]
*  That's gone. The one thing he had. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=278.12s)]
*  Was a nuclear weapon, nuclear program and nuclear infrastructure, which was elaborate and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=281.04s)]
*  sophisticated. That's been damaged. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  It's been degraded to what extent? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=287.92s)]
*  Nobody knows. Today, he's not very supreme. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=289.8s)]
*  And I think the challenge to his rule that is often neglected can more immediately come [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=294.8s)]
*  from the right. The members of the security services, the members of the Revolutionary [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=301.36s)]
*  Guards and others who are essentially suffering from the cascade of his misjudgments and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=306.16s)]
*  particularly for him not to have developed a nuclear weapon before all this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=311.52s)]
*  Everybody knows now in Iran, if they had the bomb, they wouldn't be getting bombed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=317.04s)]
*  So he will challenge it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  He would get challenged essentially very severely from the left and from the right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=323.4s)]
*  In the larger sense, he has a challenge with the population as well. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=327.72s)]
*  But there's a lot of serious problems about his authority. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=330.8s)]
*  He is significantly diminished and his authority is significantly eroded within the system [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=333.56s)]
*  and within the country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=338.12s)]
*  But Ray, if the challenges come from the right, could that create further problems for the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=339.28s)]
*  United States? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=343.84s)]
*  Well, that's right, because among the challenges that he'll have, among the petitions that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=346.4s)]
*  the right will make is for Iran to develop a clandestine nuclear program and march to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=350.28s)]
*  the bomb with some degree of alacrity. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  Whether they can do that or not remains to be seen, because I was mentioned, Iran is [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  heavily penetrated, its intelligence apparatus is penetrated. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=361.84s)]
*  So they have to do a vast counterintelligence scrub to begin with and whether they can [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=365.52s)]
*  actually have enough confidence in their personnel and their system to proceed with a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  provocative program like that remains to be seen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=374.64s)]
*  One thing coming out of this crisis, I don't think Iran will have an elaborate civilian [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=377.12s)]
*  nuclear infrastructure anymore, because that was essentially their pathway before they [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  were going to have a big nuclear program. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=385.84s)]
*  Some of it, lots of it was declared, and maybe that would give them the sneak out option. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=388.08s)]
*  Right now, the nuclear program is likely to go into the dark and Iran is likely to lessen, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=394.48s)]
*  if not completely sever its relationship with the IEA. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=399.84s)]
*  There is a lot of criticism in Iran today of the International Atomic Energy Agency, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=402.92s)]
*  and particularly its director, Rafael Agruzzi, for putting Iran in a position that they are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=407.68s)]
*  today. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=412.48s)]
*  OK, Ray Takei and Mark Polymeropoulos. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=413.28s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you so much. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=415.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egM0FebgbPY&t=418.0s)]
