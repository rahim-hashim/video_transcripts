# CIA Director Burns Met Face-To-Face With Taliban Leader Baradar
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE)
*  We start with Ken Delaney in Washington. Ken, what do we know about the CIA director's meeting? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning, Chris. Sources tell our colleague Richard Engel and me that CIA Director William [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=5.92s)]
*  Burns met face-to-face yesterday with the Taliban de facto leader Mullah Abdul Ghani [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=10.32s)]
*  Baradar in what amounts to the highest level contact between the Biden administration [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=15.36s)]
*  and the Taliban. The irony here is that Baradar is a man the CIA helped capture in jail back in 2010. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=19.52s)]
*  He was kept in prison in Pakistan for eight years, and during that time, the Pakistanis [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=26.16s)]
*  refused to let the CIA talk to him for a bit. Intelligence sources told me at the time that he [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=30.4s)]
*  was seen as a more reasonable alternative to many of the Taliban figures on the scene. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=34.64s)]
*  Now he's the leader, and CIA Director Burns, a longtime diplomat, was likely negotiating with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=39.36s)]
*  him over all the issues surrounding America's messy exit, including access to the airport and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=44.08s)]
*  the status of Americans and our allies who are trying to figure out how to get there without [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=49.2s)]
*  being harmed by the Taliban. And I can tell you, Chris, there is a lot of frustration [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=53.04s)]
*  inside the CIA about the fact that the United States has left many Afghan allies essentially [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=57.04s)]
*  stranded. It remains to be seen whether the Burns-Baradar meeting will help solve that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=62.0s)]
*  problem. Yeah, the question is, what are we going to do about it? And Courtney, President Biden will [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=66.72s)]
*  decide. We understand today if he'll extend the deadline to wrap up the evacuation. But what's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=70.56s)]
*  the calculus behind this from the Pentagon's point of view? So remember, Chris, there's nearly 6,000 [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=76.48s)]
*  U.S. troops, so many soldiers and Marines, there at Kabul airport as part of this evacuation effort. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=82.24s)]
*  You can't just get all those people and all of that equipment out in a couple of hours. In fact, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=88.32s)]
*  the estimate is anywhere in the neighborhood of three to four days to completely get all those [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  troops and any remaining U.S. Embassy Consular Affairs staff out of the airport safely. Now, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=96.72s)]
*  the big question is, what happens to the equipment that's there as well? There's artillery, there's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  counter drone, what they call CRAMs equipment, there's MRAPs, which are big vehicles. There's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=107.28s)]
*  even some aircraft there. And the big question is, what happens to that? Will the U.S. take the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  additional time it takes to get that equipment and critically, the aircraft space that it would take [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=117.68s)]
*  to get that equipment out as well? So if you back time where we are right now, it's now Tuesday, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=124.0s)]
*  August 24th, the U.S., if they meet this deadline, they have to have everything out by August 31st. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=128.96s)]
*  That's less than a week away. If you back time that three to four days, we're talking the end [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=135.52s)]
*  of the week that the U.S. would have to start getting U.S. troops out of that aircraft and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=140.0s)]
*  potentially equipment out of that airfield. So then you back time from even there, the U.S. is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  in a critical race now of only a couple of days to get the remaining Americans, third country [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=150.8s)]
*  nationals and Afghans out of that country. Now, we, I can say yesterday, Monday, there were more [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  U.S. military and charter aircraft as part of this evacuation effort than we've seen this during [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=163.28s)]
*  this entire time since it started on August 14th. If they can maintain that pace for the next couple [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=167.92s)]
*  of days, they can potentially get tens of thousands more people out of there. But if you're talking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=173.04s)]
*  about in only another two or three days, then, you know, that really cuts this timeline. So the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=177.6s)]
*  president has to make his decision today over whether he will, about whether he will maintain, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=182.96s)]
*  hold this August 31st deadline or whether he will extend it, Chris. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=188.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5HY8ggOsE&t=193.28s)]
