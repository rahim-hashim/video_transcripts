# ‘First step’ on path towards peace: Sen. Coons reacts to Israel-Hamas ceasefire
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw)
*  Joining us now is the Democratic senator from Delaware, Chris Coons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=0.0s)]
*  I think you had an opportunity to listen to the end of the story of a father who has waited [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=4.08s)]
*  467 days to hear that there could be some light perhaps at the end of the tunnel, some [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=10.32s)]
*  answer to his questions of knowing what happened to his son with certainty. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=18.12s)]
*  And he believes there is more that Congress can do, as he says, levers that have not yet [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=22.56s)]
*  been used. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=27.66s)]
*  What do you say to him and to the parents of the other hostages? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Well, Chris, thanks for a chance to be on what I hope will prove to be an historic day [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=32.44s)]
*  in achieving the release of hostages, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=38.8s)]
*  first step on the path forward towards peace. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=45.76s)]
*  The final details of this and confirmation that it's been ratified by the Israeli cabinet [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=48.56s)]
*  are not yet clear, and I'm hoping we'll have a statement from the State Department in the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  coming minutes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=59.04s)]
*  But I do think that we in Congress need to double down and continue to provide robust [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=60.64s)]
*  support for the families of American hostages, frankly, for the families of all the hostages [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=65.88s)]
*  who remain. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=71.96s)]
*  October 7th was a horrific day when Hamas took hostages from many different nationalities [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=72.96s)]
*  and many different backgrounds, and they have held them for 467 days now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=79.48s)]
*  One of the things the Biden administration has done is to create a special presidential [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=85.36s)]
*  envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=89.84s)]
*  One of the things I have found encouraging is that Steve Witkoff, who has that same role [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=93.16s)]
*  as special envoy for the Middle East, and Adam Bowler, who has that role as special [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  envoy for hostage affairs, are working hand in glove with the current special envoys from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=109.32s)]
*  That we are at this moment is a tribute to how hard President Biden and senior members [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=111.16s)]
*  of his administration, the CIA director, secretary of state, national security advisor, have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=117.22s)]
*  worked for months and months, meeting, as you just heard from Ruby, meeting with the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=122.32s)]
*  hostages' families, meeting with leaders throughout the Middle East, pressuring Qatar and through [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=127.6s)]
*  them Hamas, pressuring Israel to try and make sure that we can get to an enduring ceasefire [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=133.64s)]
*  deliver humanitarian relief to Gaza and get out the hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=139.78s)]
*  This has gone on too long, but there has been relentless, tireless effort by President Biden [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  and his senior team to get to this day. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=150.38000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned Ruby, and I know that you have met with hostage families as this war has [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  been underway. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  Can you speak, Senator, to the influence, but also just the unbelievable strength of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  these families who have not for a moment stopped advocating for their loved ones? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  I was part of a bipartisan delegation from the Senate, 10 members, Democrats and Republicans, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=171.0s)]
*  who went to Israel to Tel Aviv just two weeks after the October 7th attacks. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=177.0s)]
*  And I will never forget our meeting with the families, the American families of hostages [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=181.92s)]
*  that day. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=187.0s)]
*  I in particular met with John and Rachel, whose son Hirsch has subsequently been killed, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=188.48s)]
*  but was a hostage for more than a year. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=195.04s)]
*  And I've stayed in regular touch with John and Rachel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=198.14s)]
*  And as you say, Chris, they've been incredible pillars of strength, persistent, clear, consequential [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=200.46s)]
*  in their advocacy for the hostages, and so have the other hostage families from a wide [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=207.24s)]
*  range of nationalities and backgrounds. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  This news came, of course, as a confirmation hearing is underway for Senator Marco Rubio, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=214.48s)]
*  who is being considered for the next secretary of state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=219.28s)]
*  He addressed the possibility of a ceasefire deal during the hearing, and I want to play [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=222.92s)]
*  part of that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=226.76s)]
*  I am hopeful that there is an agreement in place that will bring hostages back immediately [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=229.28s)]
*  in an exchange and in a three-phase plan that Secretary Blinken sort of has outlined over [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=234.88s)]
*  the last 24 hours. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=239.36s)]
*  And that credit to both the Biden administration and the Trump transition works side by side [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  on helping this become about, and I hope that comes about. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  And part of that phrase, part of that deal as I understand it, is it has this very tenuous [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=248.62s)]
*  but important six-week transitional period where it's going to require international [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=253.72000000000003s)]
*  cooperation to bring some level of stability in administration. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  And that could serve as, assuming it works, that could serve as a foundation to build [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=261.94s)]
*  upon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=266.88s)]
*  Two questions that that raises for me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=268.52s)]
*  One is how important will it be, Senator, to have a secretary of state in place during [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=270.68s)]
*  this transitional period? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=275.2s)]
*  But beyond that, the idea that a special envoy from Donald Trump was able to work seamlessly, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=277.8s)]
*  apparently, with the people on the Joe Biden side who have been working on this for literally [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  more than a year. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=290.9s)]
*  Does that bode well, do you think, for the possibilities in what is a very divided country, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=292.82s)]
*  as you well know? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=298.9s)]
*  Chris, I did have a chance to talk with Senator Rubio, my partner and colleague here in the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=299.9s)]
*  Senate, for 14 years about that exact question. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=305.02s)]
*  First, I think it is a positive sign that you've got a special envoy for the Middle [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=308.18s)]
*  East and a special envoy for hostage affairs, both from the Biden administration and the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=312.86s)]
*  incoming Trump administration, who are speaking and partnering and working well together to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=317.98s)]
*  make sure that there isn't a period here, a drop or a failed transition. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  I do expect that Senator Rubio will be confirmed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  He conducted himself well in today's confirmation hearing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=332.94s)]
*  As I said in the introduction to my questioning of him, I have three questions for all the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=336.6s)]
*  nominees. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=341.94s)]
*  Do they have the relevant qualifications and experience? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  Do they have policy views that put the interests of the American people first and do they have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=345.86s)]
*  the character and integrity to lead the large and important departments they've been nominated [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=349.38s)]
*  to lead? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=353.86s)]
*  Unlike Senator Rubio, who I think answers all three of those positively, several other [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=355.38s)]
*  nominees to lead, for example, the FBI in Cash Patel or the Department of Defense in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=360.76s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, have real questions about either their character or their qualifications. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=367.62s)]
*  That's the whole point of a confirmation process, is for us to move swiftly, to confirm [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=373.34s)]
*  after appropriate hearings and thorough questioning those who are qualified and have good policy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=379.26s)]
*  positions and have shown integrity and to question or block those who do not. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=383.78s)]
*  Senator Chris Coons, on a very busy day on the Hill, but perhaps a day to be glad that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  now some families who have been suffering so much and, of course, the hostages themselves [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=397.38s)]
*  may be coming to some closure from this horrible episode. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much, Senator. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=405.8s)]
*  It's always good to see you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5Ez5a-dUw&t=406.92s)]
