# Netanyahu to present Hezbollah ceasefire deal to Israeli war cabinet
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM)
*  I am determined to do everything that it takes in order to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=0.0s)]
*  This threat has always been my top priority and even more so today when we're hearing the repeated announcements by Iran's leaders of their intention to obtain nuclear weapons. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=9.0s)]
*  To me, removal of this threat is the number one goal in order to guarantee the survival and future of the state of Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=22.0s)]
*  In Gaza, we dismantled the Hamas battalions. We killed about 20,000 terrorists. We killed Ziyawara. We killed DEF and other senior officials in that organization and returned 125 of our hostages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=32.0s)]
*  We are obligated to return the 101 hostages alive and dead that are still in Gaza and to bring an end to the terrible suffering of their families. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=47.0s)]
*  And of course, we are committed to finish the destruction of Hamas. In Judea and Samaria, we are destroying hundreds of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure and have been operating everywhere that there are terrorist cells. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=57.0s)]
*  In Yemen, we have we strike in a port where the international coalition has not done that before. In Iraq, we are stopping big drone attacks and still we have a lot of challenges ahead. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=75.0s)]
*  In Syria, we are systematically thwarting Iran Hezbollah and Syrian armies' attempts to pass armaments into Lebanon. Assad must understand that he is playing with fire. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=92.0s)]
*  And now to the seventh front, Lebanon. Hezbollah has chosen to attack us from there on October 8. It's been a year. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=106.0s)]
*  It's not the same Hezbollah anymore. We pushed Hezbollah decades back. We've killed Nasrallah. He's the head of the snake. We've killed all of the leaders. We've destroyed most of the rockets and missiles. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=116.0s)]
*  We've killed thousands of terrorists and we destroyed the underground and terrorist infrastructure near our borders that have been built over years. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=132.0s)]
*  We attacked strategic targets throughout Lebanon and destroyed many targets in the Dakhia. Lebanon is not the same. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=143.0s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, only three months ago, all of this would have sounded like science fiction, but it's not. We made it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=157.0s)]
*  And I would like to say to you, in any given moment during this war, I have my eyes on all the friends at the same time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=167.0s)]
*  This is what I did. This is what I had in mind when at the beginning of the war, I decided to focus on Gaza and not to open another front in Lebanon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=178.0s)]
*  This is what I did a few months ago when the conditions were ripe to turn our gaze northward. And then we attacked Hezbollah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=187.0s)]
*  This is what I did after the attack by Iran when we meticulously decided how and when to strike back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=196.0s)]
*  And this is what I'm doing today as well. I'm looking at all of the friends simultaneously. I'm seeing the bigger picture. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=206.0s)]
*  And I am determined to let our soldiers, our brave soldiers, and give them all of the means they need to stay alive, stay safe, and bring us the victory. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=213.0s)]
*  And that's why tonight I will bring before the cabinet a plan for a ceasefire in Lebanon. The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=225.0s)]
*  We have an understanding with the United States. We are maintaining our full liberty to take military operations. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=236.0s)]
*  If Hezbollah tries to attack us, if it arms itself, if it rebuilds infrastructure next to the borders, we will attack them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=246.0s)]
*  If they launch missiles, if they dig tunnels, we will attack. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=254.0s)]
*  Yes, I can hear people saying that if we start a ceasefire, we will not be able to attack. We will not be able to resume the war. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=260.0s)]
*  Let me remind you, this is exactly what people said to me when we entered into the ceasefire in Gaza in which we released our hostages. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=266.0s)]
*  People said we would not be fighting, but we did. And how? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=277.0s)]
*  People say to me, well, Hezbollah will lay low for a year or two, will rearm itself, and then it will attack us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=283.0s)]
*  But Hezbollah will commit a breach of the agreement not only when they fire at us, but even when they try to rearm themselves. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=291.0s)]
*  For any such breach, we will react very forcefully. I know there are those who don't believe it will do that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=303.0s)]
*  But many didn't believe that we would enter with ground forces into Gaza. And we did. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=311.0s)]
*  People didn't believe that we'll enter into Shefa and Chanyunas, and we did. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=316.0s)]
*  People didn't believe that faced with immense international pressure, we would enter into Rafa and the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=320.0s)]
*  Not only did we enter these places, we attacked them. And how? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=328.0s)]
*  There were many people who didn't believe that we would ever attack in Lebanon, and we attacked there too. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=331.0s)]
*  We attacked there very forcefully in a huge sophistication that took everybody in the world by surprise. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=337.0s)]
*  So after all of that, maybe we should start believing in our determination, in our commitment to obtaining victory. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=344.0s)]
*  So why is this the right time for a ceasefire? There are three main reasons. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=354.0s)]
*  First, focusing on the Iranian threat, and there's no need to expand. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=359.0s)]
*  Second, refreshing our forces and rearming our troops. And it's no secret, there have been delays, big delays, in the supply of arms. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=367.0s)]
*  And this delay is about to stop soon. We will arm ourselves with sophisticated arms that will help us protect our troops and give us even greater force to complete our missions. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=381.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhFtVHx1FM&t=411.0s)]
