# ISIS-K Claims Responsibility For Attack At Kabul Airport
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o)
*  And Courtney, we're just getting reports as you were talking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=0.0s)]
*  I understand that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack there in Afghanistan, which [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=2.6s)]
*  is what all the military thinkers and even the general suggested. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=8.32s)]
*  That was the belief that ISIS may have been behind these attacks today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=12.96s)]
*  Given that fact, given that the general said in his briefing, we will go after those responsible. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=18.12s)]
*  24-7, we are looking for them, is what he said. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=22.92s)]
*  Does this change the trajectory of what's happening on the ground there in Afghanistan [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=25.88s)]
*  in terms of the military operation, in terms of the evacuation effort over the next few days? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=30.4s)]
*  So it definitely slowed down. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=35.36s)]
*  It will have an impact of slowing down some of the operations at the airport, at least [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  temporarily, these evacuation operations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=42.0s)]
*  But as General McKenzie made it clear today, they are going to continue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=44.96s)]
*  They will keep moving forward, and they've got 5,000 people, he said, there at the airfield [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  waiting to be evacuated, and flights are still coming and going. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=52.04s)]
*  On the threat from ISIS, though, it's important to point out the US has the capability to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  strike back at ISIS. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Particularly, they have some strongholds in the eastern part of the country, kind of near [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=64.36s)]
*  towards the Pakistani border. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=69.72s)]
*  But do they have the intelligence available to carry out strikes like that? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=72.6s)]
*  Since the US military has left and CIA and other agencies have left as part of this drawdown [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=77.2s)]
*  for this year, the US has lost a lot of their visibility about what's going on on the ground [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=83.04s)]
*  there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=87.44s)]
*  Particularly, they don't have as strong intelligence about potential threats from groups like al-Qaeda [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=88.44s)]
*  and ISIS. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=93.84s)]
*  So in just the never-ending sort of circle of how this is one decision, the decision [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=95.08s)]
*  to withdraw, is having all these other impacts there on the ground, the decision to withdraw [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=101.0s)]
*  all US military does mean that it's more difficult for them to know where potential ISIS fighters [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  could be to strike back on something like this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=111.36s)]
*  That's why General McKenzie, he made it very clear if they have the intelligence, they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=114.36s)]
*  do have the capability to hit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=118.32s)]
*  The big question is, would they have the intelligence? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjhRXzC76o&t=120.32s)]
