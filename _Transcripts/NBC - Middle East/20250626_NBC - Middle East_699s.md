# White House ‘too soon out of the gate’ with timing of Iran report: Veteran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE)
*  NBC's Monica Alba is in Washington, D.C., retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Peter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=0.0s)]
*  Zwick, former U.S. senior defense attache to the Russian Federation, and Tim Miller [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  is with us, host of the Bullwork podcast and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=10.72s)]
*  Okay, Melanie, what do we know about what senators want to know this afternoon? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=15.36s)]
*  What are they clamoring to hear? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=20.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's quite a lot, actually, that senators want to learn, and that is because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=22.04s)]
*  up until this point, the majority of members of Congress still have not received a classified [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=26.88s)]
*  briefing on the situation on Iran, and that includes top Democratic members of the leadership. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=31.64s)]
*  So there are a number of questions, the top one being just how successful was the operation, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=37.92s)]
*  how successful were the strikes? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=42.6s)]
*  Does Iran have the capability to build a nuclear bomb, and if so, how long would it take them? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=44.72s)]
*  Here's some more senators weighing in ahead of the briefing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=50.96s)]
*  I'm not sure there's some questions that we all want answered. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=54.96s)]
*  It can be answered. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=60.36s)]
*  It can be answered. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=61.76s)]
*  But I don't think anybody knows the extent of the damage yet other than that it is substantial. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=62.96s)]
*  It doesn't make a lot of sense to throw a bunch of information out there when you don't have the answers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=70.76s)]
*  That's why you create this controversy, you know, within the press that that would actually happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=74.56s)]
*  So we'll see just how satisfied lawmakers are with the information they receive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=81.56s)]
*  The briefers today are scheduled to be Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth, as well as the CIA director and General Kaine. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=86.56s)]
*  So a pretty wide mix there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=92.16s)]
*  Lawmakers were at least happy with that list. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=93.76s)]
*  But this briefing also does come at a time of heightened tension between Congress and the administration, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=96.16s)]
*  with reports that the White House might restrict some of its intelligence sharing with members on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=101.76s)]
*  After that initial assessment of the bomb damage was leaked and even Speaker Johnson appears to be supportive of such a move. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=108.36s)]
*  He told our Ryan Nobles moments ago that this is something they are working through and that he suspects the leak did come from Congress, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=116.16s)]
*  although it's unclear whether he actually has any evidence to support that claim. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=122.86s)]
*  Well, that would seem to be a quick key question, Melanie. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=126.36s)]
*  But but general, let me go on to the complaints that we have been hearing from Democrats who are saying frankly that they don't have the information that they need. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=128.96s)]
*  Tell us why these briefings, classified briefings, are important and whether you think earlier is better. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, first of all, those briefings should be classified and in no way shared with the public. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=149.66s)]
*  And that way you can sort of get at the root of the intelligence, the fusion and all of that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=157.16s)]
*  This time, White House was too soon out of the gate with the initial report from DIA. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=164.86s)]
*  And I'm not sure how that initial DIA report came out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=172.56s)]
*  It certainly wasn't coordinated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  It's normally you want to get a fused effort of the different intelligence agencies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  But there's also an urgency to get the word up the up the leadership chain. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  In this case, we can see already, you know, again, the first report is always wrong. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  It was sort of a sarcastic thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=198.26s)]
*  We used to say in Army intelligence, which of which I was a member 34 years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of this fog of information right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  And we need to be, you know, straight, straight eyed on it and not not get out into the public. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=213.06s)]
*  This contentiousness that we've got right now, there is a lot of contentiousness, as you know, Tim, on one hand, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=224.06s)]
*  just today, Secretary Hegsteth criticized that initial assessment saying, look, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=231.16s)]
*  it came out only a day and a half after the actual strikes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=236.86s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump's assessment that the sites were obliterated came even sooner. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=240.96s)]
*  It came that night when he spoke to the American people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=247.06s)]
*  What do you make of Secretary Hegsteth's update this morning? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=250.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Look, just the lack of seriousness of Secretary Hegsteth [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=255.46s)]
*  and just this this feeling that you've got to butter up President Trump [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=262.26s)]
*  and you've got to make him feel like he was right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=267.16s)]
*  You've got to make him feel strong like we're living in some country where you have a king or a dictator who needs to be sucked up to it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=269.56s)]
*  Just it feels un-American and un-seriousness and un-serious rather. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=276.26s)]
*  And you can see the contrast just this morning in the press briefings between the Secretary of Defense and General Kaine, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=280.96s)]
*  who gave a detailed, thoughtful analysis of what we know and don't know about the extent of the damage with regards to the nuclear facilities. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=289.06s)]
*  And so it's possible to do it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=300.06s)]
*  We've seen it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  You saw it in Trump 1.0 where for all of my criticisms of it, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=304.46s)]
*  there were some serious people, you know, like General Mattis that did not play along with this reality show. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=308.26s)]
*  And unfortunately, in this term, like you have this very serious issue. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=314.85999999999996s)]
*  We're dealing with life or death. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=318.16s)]
*  We're dealing with nuclear weapons, with war, with geopolitics. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=319.26s)]
*  And the fact that you have to have a Secretary of Defense go out on TV and like berate the media like they're children and do all this puffery about the president. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=322.56s)]
*  To me, it shows a lot of insecurity and just like a lack of seriousness in the Pentagon. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=332.06s)]
*  Monica, the president called this morning's Pentagon event, that press conference, the most confirming news conference he's ever seen. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=336.16s)]
*  But what are we actually learning? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=344.96s)]
*  What did we actually learn from Pete Hegseth? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=347.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, specifically, I think it's what Tim was just talking about. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  You have the defense secretary playing a little bit more of the political role going out there and putting on a bit of a show for the president and talking about this in the broader terms. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=354.56s)]
*  They did talk a little bit more about some of that information that the CIA director had put out overnight. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  That was essentially backing up the president's initial assessment that these structures had been so severely damaged that it could set back Iran's nuclear program for years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=368.66s)]
*  Again, in contrast to the initial assessment. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=377.86s)]
*  But we got actual details from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Dan Cain. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=380.16s)]
*  He was far more specific. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=384.86s)]
*  And he even said in his remarks, which I thought was really notable, that he has never been susceptible to political pressure, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=386.56s)]
*  that he has never felt this outside influence of needing to tell the president something that he wanted to hear, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=393.06s)]
*  that he simply has been presenting him just with the information so that he can make the best decisions that he can. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=398.46s)]
*  But here's a little bit more from Pete Hegseth on how he approached all of this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  Those that do proper assessments recognize that what the United States military did was historic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=409.85999999999996s)]
*  First reports are almost always wrong. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=415.96s)]
*  They're almost always incomplete, right? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=417.56s)]
*  Anything, whether it's a squad level operation or strategic level operation, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=419.76s)]
*  the initial reflections you get are coming at you at a high rate of speed from a lot of different sources. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=425.06s)]
*  So your job is to step back and assess them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=430.46s)]
*  And so I would just note the irony there in the Pentagon chief's own comments there that essentially first reports are always wrong. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=435.26s)]
*  He's arguing when there was the president and some of his top aides who came out and tried to give all of these definitive assessments in the very early hours and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=441.76s)]
*  days before we have a complete picture, which as we know is really going to take a substantial amount of time. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=448.66s)]
*  Chris General, as someone who has worked with secretaries of defense, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=453.66s)]
*  if the secretary of defense sees as his key role to present information to the American public, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=457.66s)]
*  is that in your experience the main role that one should serve? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=466.56s)]
*  Because it did seem at the press conference today, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=471.56s)]
*  10 minutes at the start going after the media and praising President Trump, that that is where he sees his role. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  The secretary of defense has a huge role, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=485.46s)]
*  but it should be coordinated with the director of national intelligence, DNI and their staff. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=489.76s)]
*  And it should be a good coordinated position with the number of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=497.66s)]
*  defense intelligence agencies that fall, if you will, under DOD's auspices. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=504.66s)]
*  So you gotta be careful and guarded. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=511.96s)]
*  And you gotta be careful before you proclaim this or that until the intel is fully fused. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=514.66s)]
*  Fusion, that's all the intelligence, that's imagery and it's signal intelligence and human intelligence and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=525.56s)]
*  technical intelligence, that takes time. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=534.56s)]
*  And there are agencies and DOD that do that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=538.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm sad. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=542.66s)]
*  I think it got too politicized too fast and has diminished somewhat. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  Really the extraordinary role of the military in coordinating planning and delivering those massive bombs. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=550.76s)]
*  And it was actually Secretary Kaine who gave us more information about that today and the details are so impressive. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=562.66s)]
*  Tim, the American people watching this, trying to figure out what's real, what's not real, what's the truth, what isn't. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=571.16s)]
*  There's a new NBC News decision desk poll. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=577.56s)]
*  It shows that more Americans are against these strikes, 45 opposed as opposed to 38 who support them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=580.46s)]
*  60% believe that the president should have sought congressional authorization. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=587.36s)]
*  But I wonder what the Democrats do with that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  What does any member of Congress do with that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=596.86s)]
*  Do the American people have any say in this? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=598.6600000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the American people have say. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=604.86s)]
*  The degree to which it's unpopular, I think, is demonstrated that has an impact on President Trump. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=606.46s)]
*  He's responsive. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=612.96s)]
*  We've seen that in other areas, whether it be the tariffs or elsewhere where he's putting forth something that's unpopular and then he backed off of it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=613.86s)]
*  They're not completely. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I do think that matters. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=621.86s)]
*  Honestly, this is a moving situation. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=626.86s)]
*  And I think that you see in the polls kind of mixed information. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=630.26s)]
*  I think the American people, if it's a short contained strike that just goes after the Iran nuclear facilities and there's nothing beyond that, that's going to be more supportive. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=630.6600000000001s)]
*  People are going to be more supportive of that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=642.76s)]
*  If things escalate, which they did slightly with the missile attacks going between Iran and Israel, but not in a way that's affected American troops or Americans. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  But if things escalate to the fact that it does have an impact on Americans. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  I do think that will greatly impact the poll numbers, which will greatly impact President Trump. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, like a lot similar to the intelligence, you know, kind of the polling on this is still in development. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=664.26s)]
*  And I think that the impact will know more in the coming weeks and it will be affected a lot by what the real facts on the ground are. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcBFymgSVGE&t=671.5600000000001s)]
