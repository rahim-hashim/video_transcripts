# Rep. Gallego On The Explosions In Kabul: 'This Should Not Deter Us'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U)
*  Joining us now, Congressman Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a Marine Corps veteran who serves [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=0.0s)]
*  on the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=4.04s)]
*  Congressman, first, your reaction to what happened today in Afghanistan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=5.92s)]
*  I mean, it's just horrific. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=9.52s)]
*  I feel for those Marines. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=13.52s)]
*  You know, you got to remember, there's a lot of Marines that saw this happen, saw their [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  buddies die, and now they had to go back and continue the mission. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=19.64s)]
*  And when you have a hit this hard, I was unfortunately in a company that saw almost that same amount [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=24.62s)]
*  of men die at one point. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=32.1s)]
*  It is very difficult to go on for the rest of the day, but they will. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=33.46s)]
*  They have a mission to continue, and they will continue. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=36.94s)]
*  But I feel horrible for them, and I feel horrible about the situation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=40.7s)]
*  There are, of course, various estimates of how many Americans are still in the country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=44.3s)]
*  Congressman, a new update from the State Department spokesperson saying roughly 500 of the 1,500 [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=47.42s)]
*  Americans the Secretary of State said were being tracked as potentially being in Afghanistan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=52.78s)]
*  have been evacuated, and the State Department is in contact with the roughly 1,000 remaining [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=56.86s)]
*  Americans, over two-thirds of who say they're taking steps to leave. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=61.34s)]
*  With everything that has happened in the past 24 hours, how important is it to try and get [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=65.62s)]
*  these remaining Americans out before the deadline in five days? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=70.22s)]
*  Look, it does matter. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=74.34s)]
*  We have a mission, and that is to protect Americans, both here and abroad. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=76.66000000000001s)]
*  We need to make sure that everyone knows that when Americans are in harm's way that we're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=82.7s)]
*  going to do everything we can to get them out. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  So this is not—this should not deter us, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what ISIS-K wants to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=92.54s)]
*  They want to deter us from our mission, number one. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  Number two, use this opportunity to actually do recruitment and fundraising, and—or number [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  three, to actually keep us in Afghanistan so that they can continue to do the recruitment [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=101.96s)]
*  and fundraising. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  But our goal is very clear. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  We need to get out the Americans that want to get out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=109.16s)]
*  We need to continue to evacuate as many of those Afghans that helped us as we possibly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  can and then end this combat operation altogether in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=117.28s)]
*  Congressman, does what happened today change the strategy? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=124.36s)]
*  Does it change the equation at all? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=127.96s)]
*  Look, I don't think it should. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=131.16s)]
*  We need to continue to finish this mission, right, combat mission at this point. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=134.24s)]
*  You can't be deterred from our goal of saving the Afghans as well as the U.S. civilians [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=139.48s)]
*  that need to be there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  When you answer and alter your mission to terrorism, really, at that point, terrorism [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=147.48s)]
*  is winning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=153.8s)]
*  So it's hard to say. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=154.8s)]
*  It's hard to say what we should do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=157.04s)]
*  But unfortunately, what it means we have to do is continue this mission. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=159.92s)]
*  Now, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be more aggressive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=162.32s)]
*  We shouldn't be using other levels of deterrence, such as making sure that we're—you know, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=164.64s)]
*  if we have known ISIS targets in Afghanistan, we should probably target them right now to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=169.56s)]
*  show some level of deterrence that there will be consequences. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=173.6s)]
*  But in the meantime, we have to continue with this mission. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=177.56s)]
*  General McKenzie, during his briefing at the Pentagon, talked about the president asking [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=180.44s)]
*  whether or not there was enough force on the ground, his assuring the president that there [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=185.28s)]
*  was, in fact, enough force on the ground currently to meet the level of threat. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=189.4s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can walk us through, so that we can all understand, the choreography [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=193.32s)]
*  of what a withdrawal will look like in these coming days, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=199.44s)]
*  Help us understand what it looks like in this moment and what it's going to look like to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  meet that deadline. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=207.76s)]
*  Well, it's going to be extremely difficult, but essentially there's two things. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=208.76s)]
*  First of all, you have to get out all the civilians. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Once you get off all the civilians, you start kind of collapsing the perimeter from without [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=216.56s)]
*  slowly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=219.96s)]
*  And in that regard, this is where we actually have a working relationship. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=220.96s)]
*  We don't have to trust the Taliban, but we have to have a working relationship with the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=224.4s)]
*  Taliban, basically to hold a perimeter while we slowly collapse our perimeter. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=227.16s)]
*  We're getting more and more troops on to planes, and we're kind of slowing and, you know, shrinking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=232.06s)]
*  the pocket of where we are. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=238.96s)]
*  So we're both keeping ourselves safe, keeping everyone else within that pocket safe, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=240.76s)]
*  at the same time having standoff distance from the Taliban, as well as making sure that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=244.64s)]
*  we still have the operational capability of taking off. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=248.2s)]
*  So this is a multifaceted step that's going to require coordination. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  And unfortunately, we have to do this with the Taliban at this point. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=256.0s)]
*  And we got to remember the Taliban and ISIS-K are enemies to each other right now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=259.08s)]
*  So we need to do some coordination with them to both secure the remainder of the airfield [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=263.12s)]
*  once we're out, to make sure that we don't get overrun by civilians that are still trying [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  to go out and or ISIS-K. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=270.7s)]
*  But at the same time, we need to coordinate with them on any type of offensive action [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=273.8s)]
*  we need to do between now and us leaving to really deter ISIS-K from trying to do further [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  types of these types of actions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=283.0s)]
*  The unfortunate problem is, when you're dealing with these situations, especially in urban [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=284.72s)]
*  environments, it is very easy for terrorists to win. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not that hard to make a car bomb. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  It's not that hard to make a suicide vest. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of bodies. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=296.48s)]
*  There's a lot of people walking around. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=297.56s)]
*  Anytime they even kill one American, it's a success. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  Every time we stop them, it's not necessarily the same thing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=303.7s)]
*  That's the nature of fighting terrorism. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=306.3s)]
*  Congressman, to this conversation about the evacuations, dozens of California students [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=308.14s)]
*  and parents trapped in Afghanistan, according to the New York Times. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=312.78s)]
*  Almost two dozen students and their parents from San Diego County in California trapped [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=316.62s)]
*  in Afghanistan after they visited the country this summer, the authorities said. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=320.62s)]
*  The 20 students and 14 parents are stuck in Afghanistan and have requested government [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=324.62s)]
*  assistance to fly home, according to a statement from their school district. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=328.86s)]
*  And a tweet from Representative Darrell Issa, who represents the district where the students [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=333.26s)]
*  are from. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  The children range in age from preschool to high school. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  Congressman, you said earlier on our air that you were working with people on the ground [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=340.62s)]
*  to get people out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=344.26s)]
*  Now, the State Department is telling congressional staff to not direct people to the airport. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=345.26s)]
*  What are they supposed to do if the airport has been closed? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=349.92s)]
*  Well, you should still call the State Department because we need to kind of we need to figure [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=353.06s)]
*  out where you are. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=357.46s)]
*  There are operations that are leaving from the from the airfield. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  I won't go into details to pick up U.S. citizens. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  So continue to give us information about where you are so we know exactly where you are, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=367.62s)]
*  so we can pass on that information and plan to work with other people like I've been working [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  to get this done. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=376.62s)]
*  The other thing I would say is that it is very inappropriate for those family members [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  to go to Afghanistan. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=383.54s)]
*  There was direct warnings from the State Department that they should not have gone into the airport [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=385.74s)]
*  is an unstable region. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=388.62s)]
*  In the summer, there was direct multiple, multiple warnings. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=390.94s)]
*  And I just want to point it out that this is the kind of things that you should be listening [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=394.34000000000003s)]
*  to to the State Department because now we're going to put men and women's lives in danger [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=397.62s)]
*  trying to go get these groups of students. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=402.06s)]
*  And it's very response. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=404.74s)]
*  It's not the students fault, but it's certainly the parents faults or anybody else, any adult [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=405.74s)]
*  that allowed this to happen. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=409.34000000000003s)]
*  There's going to have to be some very dangerous missions to go get them out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=410.74s)]
*  And it is ridiculous that they did not listen to the State Department warnings earlier in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=413.9s)]
*  the year and also the warnings, by the way, to leave. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  We had the State Department had many warnings throughout the summer encouraging Americans [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=420.85999999999996s)]
*  to leave Afghanistan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=424.84s)]
*  And it was extremely irresponsible that they did not do it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=425.84s)]
*  Congressman, I do want to ask you, we're going to be hearing from the president around five [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  o'clock tonight. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  We know that his message will, of course, be for the general public. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  But what is it that you think veterans need to hear from the president tonight? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=436.58s)]
*  We need to be very clear. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=442.46s)]
*  What is the remaining remaining mission? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=443.62s)]
*  You know, we all, especially Marines, understand the idea of a mission objective. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=446.14s)]
*  And sometimes that means you have to sacrifice men and women to do that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=450.7s)]
*  But we need to be clear. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=453.9s)]
*  What is the end game here? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=455.0s)]
*  What is going to be the line that tells us to get out after we have X amount of U.S. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=457.62s)]
*  citizens out or other evacuees? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=461.38s)]
*  What is also going to be the payback? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=465.86s)]
*  We cannot have this type of attack on our forces without a proportional, actually, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=468.76s)]
*  disproportional response on ISIS-K. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  They need to hurt for this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=478.64s)]
*  They need to understand that this is not something that we will stand for. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=480.36s)]
*  And we need to do it rather quickly. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=484.68s)]
*  And then lastly, we need to show empathy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=487.4s)]
*  This is a very awful situation. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=490.02s)]
*  Losing this many Marines or any service members in one action is difficult. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=492.85999999999996s)]
*  It has not happened that often during war. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=501.02s)]
*  As I said, I was unfortunately one of the instances that I was there when it happened, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=503.62s)]
*  and it is traumatizing to the families. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=508.7s)]
*  It's traumatizing to the service members. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=511.53999999999996s)]
*  It's traumatizing to the public. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=513.22s)]
*  But the president needs to be clear that our objective is done. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=515.14s)]
*  And this is why, and I think, again, he needs to reiterate why we need to leave Afghanistan, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=519.5s)]
*  that this is an untenable situation that is not in our long-term national interest in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=525.42s)]
*  terms of our security, and that we need to finish the mission, get the U.S. citizens [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=530.38s)]
*  out, get the other evacuees out that we want to get out, and then leave Afghanistan. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTN4XNJXM1U&t=535.54s)]
