# 'We Will Hunt You Down And Make You Pay': Biden Responds To Kabul Attack
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM)
*  The lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=0.0s)]
*  the service of security, the service of others, in the service of America. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=5.76s)]
*  Like their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  in the struggle against terrorism. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Of the fallen this day, they're part of a great and noble company of American heroes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=26.32s)]
*  To those who carried out this attack, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=33.52s)]
*  as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this. We will not forgive. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=38.16s)]
*  We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=44.4s)]
*  I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  Over the past few weeks, I know you're many of you're probably tired of hearing me say it, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  but we've been made aware by our intelligence community [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=68.72s)]
*  that the ISIS-K, an arch enemy, the Taliban, people who were freed when both those prisons [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=75.6s)]
*  were opened, has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=84.32s)]
*  This is why, from the outset, I've repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=90.96s)]
*  and why I've been so determined to limit the duration of this mission. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=100.0s)]
*  As General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed, this is the way it was designed to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=105.6s)]
*  operate, operate under severe stress and attack. We've known that from the beginning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=110.4s)]
*  We've known that from the beginning. And as I've been in constant contact with our senior [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=117.04s)]
*  military leaders, and I mean constant, around the clock, and our commanders on the ground [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=122.56s)]
*  throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=128.8s)]
*  And that's what I've ordered them to do. We will not be deterred by terrorists. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=136.88s)]
*  We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=143.76s)]
*  I've also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=148.88s)]
*  leadership and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=153.44s)]
*  at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. These ISIS terrorists will not win. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=163.92s)]
*  Again, we will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get our Afghan allies out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=168.48s)]
*  And our mission will go on. America will not be intimidated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  And I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=181.76s)]
*  mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=185.76s)]
*  out of Afghanistan. Every day when I talk to our commanders, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=191.44s)]
*  I ask them what they need. What more do they need, if anything, to get the job done? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=197.84s)]
*  As they will tell you, I granted every request. I reiterated to them today on three occasions [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=203.6s)]
*  that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground on Kabul. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=211.68s)]
*  And I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership of the Pentagon [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=216.32s)]
*  and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=221.84s)]
*  from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=226.8s)]
*  Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=234.16s)]
*  when the Lord says, Whom shall I send? Who shall go for us? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=239.36s)]
*  The American military has been answering for a long time, Here I am, Lord, send me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=244.4s)]
*  Here I am, send me. Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=252.56s)]
*  tradition of sacrifice and volunteering to go in harm's way to risk everything, not for glory, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=259.68s)]
*  not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=268.32s)]
*  uniform, military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=281.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=298.8s)]
*  May God bless you all. May God protect his troops and all those standing watch for America. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=312.32s)]
*  We have so much to do. It's within our capacity to do it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=delAcoyigZM&t=316.88s)]
