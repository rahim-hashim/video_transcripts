# 'UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!': Trump makes demands for Iran amid conflict with Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ)
*  Joining us now, NBC News Chief White House correspondent Peter Alexander, senior fellow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Stephen Cook. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=4.76s)]
*  Also with us, a lead negotiator for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Robert Malley. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  He's now a lecturer at Yale University and the author of a new book out in September [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=14.44s)]
*  called Tomorrow is Yesterday, Life, Death and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel-Palestine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=18.88s)]
*  All right, Peter. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=24.68s)]
*  I'm hoping you can give us a little bit more clarity about the decision to use the term [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=26.56s)]
*  we in these social media posts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Well, here's what we can tell you with certitude. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  We don't know exactly what the president's referring to when he says we. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=37.6s)]
*  Clearly, he is claiming some credit for the situation taking place in the skies over Iran [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=40.16s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=43.8s)]
*  You remember ahead of these strikes, the president last week was pushing for diplomacy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=44.8s)]
*  Now a very different message from this president only a short time ago in all caps on his preferred [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  megaphone, truth social posting, unconditional surrender, calling for Iran's unconditional [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=55.52s)]
*  surrender, citing the possibility of killing the supreme leader there, referring, as you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=61.64s)]
*  know, to the efforts taking place over Iran right now as we, the president, with this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=65.8s)]
*  seeming threat, at least a warning to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=71.64s)]
*  that we know exactly where he's hiding is an easy target. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=76.76s)]
*  We're not going to take him out or kill him, at least not for now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=79.88s)]
*  We should note that just last week, NBC News was told that the president had rejected a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=83.4s)]
*  proposal by the Israelis, which would have targeted the supreme leader of Iran. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=86.92s)]
*  Now, perhaps the message appears to be changing a bit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And again, to the point about we have complete and total control of the skies over Iran, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=95.72s)]
*  of course, the U.S. has no fighter jets, to our knowledge, that are flying there right [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=99.16s)]
*  now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  They have been helping Israel shoot down incoming weapons that have been targeting Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  So, Katie, to your point, all of this ahead of a situation remaining, we're told, should [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=109.96s)]
*  be starting either within this hour or certainly soon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  The president is going to be speaking with his national security advisors with a real [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  significant decision to make about whether the U.S. should weigh in directly in this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  war or should continue to pursue a more peace-type deal effort. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  The president yesterday and again today indicating that he seems to be in no mood to negotiate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=132.04s)]
*  at this time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=137.04s)]
*  Katie? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=138.04s)]
*  At the very least, Peter, it seems like they want to appear as if they are standing side [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=139.12s)]
*  by side on Israel and that they are willing to go as far as it takes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=144.04s)]
*  They want to appear that way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=147.88s)]
*  And what's interesting is the way that it's fractured, his coalition, the MAGA base. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=149.48s)]
*  You have Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon saying it's a bad idea, Donald Trump going after [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=158.64s)]
*  But then J.D. Vance, who's long been the holder of America First below Donald Trump, don't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=159.64s)]
*  get involved in foreign entanglements and even want to bother with Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=165.68s)]
*  Peter, he posted a really lengthy message on social media that was directed at everybody [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=169.12s)]
*  questioning this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  And he's talking about civilian nuclear power versus uranium enrichment. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=176.4s)]
*  He's calling them distinct issues. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Iran could have civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=183.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, they've enriched uranium far above the level necessary for any civilian purpose. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  What is the significance of J.D. Vance getting involved in this and getting so firmly behind [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump on at least, again, appearing as if the United States is going to attack [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=199.64s)]
*  Iran alongside Israel? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=204.72s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of ways to read this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's important that people sort of get an understanding that we don't know [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=209.0s)]
*  exactly what is going to happen here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=211.64s)]
*  But it does make a couple indications. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  One, it almost sounds like J.D. Vance, the vice president of the United States, is sort [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=215.0s)]
*  of priming Americans, preparing Americans for the potential that the U.S. will get further [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=218.34s)]
*  involved in what's taking place between Israel and Iran right now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, as you have indicated, that would go against sort of the president's America [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  first messaging, at least at first at first blanch at this point. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=231.8s)]
*  Right. The bottom line is this is America first president who was calling for the end [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  of these idiotic foreign entanglements, as J.D. Vance refers to them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  But now he says that the president has earned has earned trust on this issue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  And he indicates that the president's primary concern to the point of America first is that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=250.44s)]
*  no American assets, interests or personnel are harmed in that region. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=255.44s)]
*  Obviously, if Americans are targeted or hurt, the president would be quick to get involved. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=260.24s)]
*  The question is, absent that, is the president still motivated to further engage? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=264.6s)]
*  It requires a B-2 bomber, a 30,000 pound bomb, bunker busting bombs, you noted that only [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=270.04s)]
*  United States has right now is what we're seeing right now enough for the U.S. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=275.24s)]
*  to get involved directly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=280.56s)]
*  So just on what's happening right now, loud explosions have been heard in Tehran, according [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=282.64s)]
*  to our NBC News team that's on the ground. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=289.48s)]
*  The IDF has just sent out a notice saying they've completed missile strikes and storage [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=291.36s)]
*  strikes in the heart of Iran. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=297.44s)]
*  Rob, I want to ask you the question of will this pressure Iran to fold, to come to the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=300.44s)]
*  negotiating table and to, I don't know, get rid of their nuclear program, whatever the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=306.88s)]
*  demands are from the Israelis and the Americans? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  Is this the sort of pressure that will make them move? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=314.8s)]
*  You know pretty well as somebody who was the last person, last group of people, to negotiate [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  directly with Iran on their nuclear program. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=323.56s)]
*  So it depends, you know, coming to the negotiating table, they never wanted to leave it, so I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=327.08s)]
*  don't think that's the question. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=331.4s)]
*  It really is what you're asking. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=332.4s)]
*  Are they prepared to agree to the unconditional surrender that President Trump just demanded? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=333.52s)]
*  It's very hard for me to imagine that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=339.76s)]
*  I mean, this is a regime that has built its whole narrative over the notion of resistance [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=341.44s)]
*  and self-reliance, so they can make concessions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=345.06s)]
*  I could imagine today they're in a mood to make more concessions than a week ago. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=347.68s)]
*  But if you're talking about a complete surrender, complete capitulation, that not only exposes [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=352.32s)]
*  them to more demands by the U.S. and Israel, but also potentially to domestic contestation, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=357.54s)]
*  and that's something that would be more existential for them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=362.96s)]
*  There is a lot of debate today about what the best plan of action is, what is going [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=366.48s)]
*  to be the best way to get Iran to negotiate and to successfully negotiate in the eyes [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=370.92s)]
*  of Israel and Iran. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=375.94s)]
*  Thomas Friedman had an op-ed in the New York Times, and there's always been a lot of criticism [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=377.96s)]
*  on Friedman for the Iraq war and his support of it, initially at least. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=382.24s)]
*  And he's saying, he's arguing that the best way to get Iran to fold is for the United [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=387.32s)]
*  States to give Israel everything it wants to destroy Iran's nuclear capability. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=393.98s)]
*  Give them the bunker-busting bomb or fly the plane that's needed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=399.52s)]
*  Give them that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=405.42s)]
*  Allow them to have that capability, and that will force Iran to fold. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=406.42s)]
*  That sort of pressure will leave them no other choice. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=412.04s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=414.8s)]
*  Listen, I don't know where we've seen precedent for that in the Middle East, certainly in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=415.8s)]
*  the case of countries that have been subjected to that kind of pressure. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=420.04s)]
*  Their tendency for a regime like the Iranian regime is not to capitulate without being [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  able to save face, because again, that could affect their capacity to continue to rule [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=429.68s)]
*  at home. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=434.6s)]
*  So very hard for me to see. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=435.68s)]
*  I think a more likely scenario in that, if it's what you describe, is for the regime [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=437.16s)]
*  to try to hunker down, absorb the blows, and wait. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=441.88000000000005s)]
*  For them, this is a long movie. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=445.68s)]
*  It doesn't end in a day, in a week, in a month, even in a year. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=446.88000000000005s)]
*  Hunker down and wait for the time where they could reassert themselves, and that could [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  be in the far distant future. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  Stephen, what about the rest of the region here? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=456.56s)]
*  How are they viewing this? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  Because Iran is certainly no friend to a lot of the neighboring countries. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=460.8s)]
*  It really depends on who you're talking about. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=466.56s)]
*  If you're talking about the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Bokhranis, even the Egyptians, they will [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  be publicly critical of the Israelis and what they've been doing, while privately admiring [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=472.92s)]
*  Israel's technical proficiency, and hoping that this brings the Iranians finally to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  heel, whether there is actually regime change there, or the Iranians are weakened enough [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=484.92s)]
*  that they no longer menace the region. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=489.44s)]
*  Remember, the Iranians have spent decades building proxy forces that have sowed chaos [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=491.48s)]
*  throughout the region. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  They've been building this nuclear program that has also menaced the region. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  There's really no love lost among the major Arab states for the Iranians, despite whatever [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  rapprochement they've had with them over the course of the last year or so. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=508.24s)]
*  What about the likelihood or the prospect of the U.S. getting more directly involved? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=512.12s)]
*  Again, Donald Trump is saying we. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=516.92s)]
*  He's saying we know where Khomeini is. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=518.24s)]
*  We can find him if we want to. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=522.0s)]
*  What is the risk for the United States to get directly involved, Stephen? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=524.56s)]
*  Well, there are significant risks. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=528.16s)]
*  We've seen the United States get involved in conflicts and have a very hard time getting [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=530.68s)]
*  itself out. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  This may be something different. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=535.24s)]
*  The Iranian people may take matters into their own hands. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=537.88s)]
*  That certainly has been an unstated or barely unstated goal of the Israelis, is to weaken [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=541.04s)]
*  the regime to the extent that Iranians can take matters into their own hands. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=545.52s)]
*  But even if Donald Trump had the inclination to go in and do nation building, he's basically [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=549.64s)]
*  neutered those parts of the U.S. government that are charged with doing that kind of thing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=555.24s)]
*  if we were going to do it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=559.4s)]
*  So there are risks of getting involved in a conflict. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=561.04s)]
*  As Rob has pointed out, this is a regime that's going to hang on and hunker down and use whatever [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=563.88s)]
*  resources it has at its disposal until it is forced to unconditional surrender. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=568.24s)]
*  So one bombing run may not be it for the United States. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=575.14s)]
*  And we know that Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of patience for foreign entanglements. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=579.6999999999999s)]
*  What would an acceptable, Rob, new nuclear deal be for the Iranians? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=584.34s)]
*  Does it look like the JCPOA or would they be willing to go farther to get rid of their [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=588.54s)]
*  uranium enrichment entirely? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=593.78s)]
*  Again, as I said, and first of all, I think Steve Woodcock, the president's envoy, had [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=596.3s)]
*  some creative ideas that might have succeeded if diplomacy had been given more of a chance, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=600.82s)]
*  more time, who knows. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=605.5s)]
*  At this point, certainly the JCPOA is dead and Iran can't aspire to something even resembling [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=607.1800000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=612.58s)]
*  Could it even get what Steve Woodcock had put on the table, which was this idea of a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=613.58s)]
*  regional consortium in which Iran would participate and they might have been able to enrich uranium [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=617.82s)]
*  until such time as that consortium was set up? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=622.62s)]
*  Again, that was a creative idea. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=625.82s)]
*  I don't know right now whether either President Trump and certainly not Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=627.18s)]
*  are in the mood to contemplate that, which is why diplomacy, which in my view it would [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=631.8599999999999s)]
*  be a better outcome than what we're seeing right now, but it does seem far away off because [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=635.9399999999999s)]
*  the gap between Iran's position and the American position, which was already not insubstantial, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=640.5s)]
*  has just widened considerably. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=647.3399999999999s)]
*  Steven, why now? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=649.18s)]
*  Why did Benjamin Netanyahu choose to go after the Iranians now? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=651.66s)]
*  Was it because of just a confluence of events, weaker Hezbollah, weaker Hamas, weaker Houthis? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=656.38s)]
*  Or were there domestic issues at play? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=663.1s)]
*  Why now? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=664.98s)]
*  Well, I think there's a number of factors at play here. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=665.98s)]
*  And the first is that the Israelis believed that they had developed intelligence that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=670.38s)]
*  suggested that the Iranians were moving towards weaponization or that weaponization would [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=673.98s)]
*  be easier for them and that the Iranians were producing large numbers of ballistic missiles [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=678.0s)]
*  that would overwhelm the Israelis. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=683.7s)]
*  And I think the second piece of it is, goes back to the October 7th, 2023 attacks, in [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=686.3s)]
*  which in the aftermath, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to quote-unquote change the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=691.14s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=695.9s)]
*  They have, for better or worse, more likely worse, changed Gaza. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=696.9s)]
*  They've changed Lebanon. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=701.18s)]
*  They've played a role in changing Syria. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=702.18s)]
*  And now they're taking it upon themselves to try to change Iran as well, what they refer [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=704.2s)]
*  to as the head of the snake. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwBLuS5rDQ&t=709.1s)]
