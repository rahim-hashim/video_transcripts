# Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi dead in helicopter crash
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM)
*  in with significant breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's state media is reporting that the nation's president [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=3.56s)]
*  and foreign minister have died in a helicopter crash. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Search teams arrived at the site of what was originally [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=11.48s)]
*  called a hard landing, and they found no sign of life. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=14.42s)]
*  According to a news outlet affiliated [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=19.72s)]
*  with the Iranian government, seven other officials [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=21.68s)]
*  were on board the aircraft at the time of the accident. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=24.84s)]
*  The Associated Press cites Iranian state TV [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=28.8s)]
*  as giving no immediate cause for the crash, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=31.96s)]
*  although weather could be a factor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=36.32s)]
*  The group was returning from an event near Iran's border [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=39.24s)]
*  with Azerbaijan when the helicopter went down. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=42.2s)]
*  Heavy fog prevented search and rescue teams [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=45.56s)]
*  from finding the wreckage for hours. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=47.96s)]
*  A hardline conservative within the Iranian political landscape, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=51.64s)]
*  the president, Rahi Rahishi, has been Iran's leader since 2021. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=56.32s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News chief foreign correspondent, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=61.92s)]
*  Richard Engel, live from Europe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Richard, tell us, what's the latest [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  we know here about the cause of the crash? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=69.92s)]
*  And tell us a little bit more about the man who died. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=72.88s)]
*  So what we know is from Iranian state media [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=78.72s)]
*  that there was this trip meeting with officials in Azerbaijan [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=81.12s)]
*  in the border area. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=86.04s)]
*  This is a mountainous area in northern Iran covered in forests. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=86.88s)]
*  There were, according to Iranian state media, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=92.48s)]
*  three helicopters traveling together. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=94.6s)]
*  One of them went down carrying the Iranian president, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=97.92s)]
*  Rahishi, and other officials. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=101.56s)]
*  They initially said it was a hard landing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=104.2s)]
*  There was quite a bit of skepticism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=107.32s)]
*  However, when images of the area started to emerge, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=108.68s)]
*  totally blanketed in fog, generally helicopter crashes [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=112.0s)]
*  don't end well, don't often end with survivors, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=116.52s)]
*  particularly in the mountains, in the forests, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  with those kind of conditions. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Then for the overnight period in Iran, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  there was quite a bit of silence. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  People were anticipating that Iran was going to be making an announcement. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  The anchors on state television started wearing black. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=135.56s)]
*  There was this presumption that soon they would be announcing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=139.48s)]
*  that he had died, and then relatively short while ago, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=142.4s)]
*  because this is now about 16 hours or so since it happened. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  So quite a few hours passed before they made the announcement [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=151.44s)]
*  that they did not find survivors among the wreckage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=154.44s)]
*  It causes short-term problems for Iran, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=158.04s)]
*  but more importantly, it raises some serious succession issues [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=163.0s)]
*  about the Iranian regime, because President Raisi was, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=167.84s)]
*  yes, as you mentioned, a hardliner, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=172.36s)]
*  but he was also tapped to be, very likely tapped to be, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=174.6s)]
*  the next supreme leader in Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=179.84s)]
*  And Iran doesn't function, Iran is a theocracy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=182.2s)]
*  It has been in power since 1979, since they overthrew in Iran [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=185.28s)]
*  thousands of years of hereditary rule by different dynasties, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=189.8s)]
*  monarchies, and shahs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=193.96s)]
*  After the theocracy came in, in 1979, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=196.88s)]
*  the country has been ruled by clerics, only two of them, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=200.68s)]
*  and the second Ayatollah, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is 85 years old, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=205.44s)]
*  and Raisi was widely anticipated to replace him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=211.12s)]
*  A man who was in his 60s could have potentially been leading Iran [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=215.36s)]
*  in the ultimate position of power for the next two decades, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=219.76s)]
*  and now he died in this helicopter crash. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=224.04s)]
*  So they have two immediate problems. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=229.52s)]
*  One, to replace the president. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=231.76s)]
*  Technically, the vice president steps in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=234.56s)]
*  and should hold new elections within the next 50 days, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=236.76s)]
*  but the president is not the one who wields the power. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=240.4s)]
*  The main decisions in the country [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=243.48s)]
*  are with the supreme leader, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=245.72s)]
*  and he was being groomed to be the supreme leader, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=247.4s)]
*  raising real questions about the future of rule in that country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=251.4s)]
*  Could it expedite more power being... [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=255.84s)]
*  Could we start seeing students seeing more power [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=260.24s)]
*  being wielded by the Revolutionary Guard? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Some analysts that I've spoken to, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=267.0s)]
*  intelligence officials, believe we should watch this internal space. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=268.68s)]
*  They do not expect to see any major changes in policy, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=273.04s)]
*  that the basic positions of Iran, which are three [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=277.32s)]
*  and have been fixed for the last several decades, will not change. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=280.92s)]
*  And those three core principles of Iran being [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=285.04s)]
*  that Israel should be replaced with Palestine, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=288.64s)]
*  that the United States should be driven out of the Middle East, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=291.4s)]
*  and that the US-led world order should be overturned, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=293.6s)]
*  and that Iran needs to make allies with whoever is on that page, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=297.8s)]
*  including Iran or Maduro or a host of others. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=301.48s)]
*  So they do not expect that those three basic core principles from Iran [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=305.2s)]
*  are going to change, but it does create a leadership crisis, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=309.12s)]
*  which could potentially even threaten clerical rule [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=312.68s)]
*  at the expense of seeing a more traditional military dictatorship, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  the Rev Guard, stepping in. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=320.2s)]
*  And this comes, of course, such a fraught moment in the region, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=321.56s)]
*  the war in Gaza, and the recent hostilities between Iran and Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  The world is certainly watching what happens here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  thank you, we will see you again very shortly. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=333.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-nYecW_XM&t=339.08s)]
