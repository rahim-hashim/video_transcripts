# MAGA clash: Gabbard and Hegseth outside Trump inner circle on Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI)
*  As President Trump weighs what might be the most consequential decision of his second term, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=0.0s)]
*  whether or not to strike Iran, neither the director of national intelligence [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=4.24s)]
*  nor the secretary of defense is playing a central role in his inner circle, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=9.44s)]
*  according to new reporting from the Washington Post. Joining us now, Mark McKinnon and Rick [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=14.16s)]
*  Stengel, who are back with us. OK, No Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth, according to this reporting, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=19.44s)]
*  have been put, they've been pushed off to the sidelines. That's interesting. It makes that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=25.84s)]
*  circle around Donald Trump, the decision makers even smaller. Well, that's a good thing. If I'm [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  sorry, that was the case. I don't know if Mark agrees, but Tulsi Gabbard has proved that she's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  sort of feckless. Hegseth is self-explanatory. The fact that he's using Rubio, he's using the chairman [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=42.56s)]
*  of the Joint Chiefs, he's using John Radcliffe, they at least have a semblance of being grownups. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=48.24s)]
*  I do think that is a good thing. The other frame, though, to go back to our previous discussion, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=54.56s)]
*  that people are not looking at, and I don't mean to seem disingenuous, but he's not looking at it, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  peace versus war. He's looking at where the camera's going. Israel invades Iran, suddenly all the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=65.12s)]
*  cameras away from the budget bill, from everything on what's going on in the Middle East. He wants [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=71.36s)]
*  to sneak back in the camera by saying, hey, maybe I'll get involved with this. He's a guy who, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=76.0s)]
*  as you know better than anybody, Katie, wants to be the bride at the wedding and the corpse at the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=81.36s)]
*  funeral. Is there a war going on somewhere? I've got to get in it somehow. At least I have to be [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=85.36s)]
*  perceived that I could be a player. That is what's operating rather than any actual philosophical [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=90.48s)]
*  ideas about peace and war. Well, I go back to my original thesis about what I think, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=95.68s)]
*  where Trump is really at his core and what he really wants. The fact that he sidelined Tulsi [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=99.68s)]
*  Gabbard, who was appointed specifically because she was an isolationist and reflected the MAGA [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=103.6s)]
*  base, that's a tell. Now, apparently the latest news that I've read is that Hegseth has been [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=108.64s)]
*  sidelined in favor of General Eric Corilla, who's the US Central Commander, who is nicknamed the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=114.08s)]
*  gorilla, who I don't know what his propensity is in this, but I suspect it's pretty aggressive. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=120.16s)]
*  There's also just the fact that the inner circle is so much smaller. I mean, you have Marco Rubio [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=127.12s)]
*  playing the dual role right now of Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=133.44s)]
*  I wonder, I mean, I want to say, does it matter? But I also think that Donald Trump is one that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=140.0s)]
*  he doesn't listen to anybody. He goes where he feels like going. In the moment, he feels like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=146.48s)]
*  going there. I mean, you're talking about where the cameras are pointed. I think that that's not [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=153.2s)]
*  wrong. But it does mean that he's not getting information. He's not getting a lot of advice, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=159.12s)]
*  informed advice. The people who were giving him that informed advice last time around, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  he didn't want to hear from them. Well, the Chairman of the Joint Chief says, I mean, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=174.56s)]
*  your point that you made before, Katie, speaks to this, which is that he's not explaining what the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=179.36s)]
*  issues are for America. What are the issues for America? Why shouldn't, why is it a foundational [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=186.08s)]
*  issue for Trump that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon? Why is this something that the US should [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  be involved in? Why are we allied with Israel? He says because they chant death to America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  They chant death to America. I went to Iran in 2014. I was sitting at a rally. These young [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  guys were chanting death to America. I had a minder. I said, what are they saying? They're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=211.28s)]
*  saying death to America. They finished the chant and two young men came over and said, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=214.96s)]
*  are you American? I said, yes. We want to welcome you to our country. We love American culture and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=218.56s)]
*  love American movies. They wanted to talk about all these things. Iran is the most western nation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=223.52s)]
*  in the whole Middle East. We have much more in common with them than a lot of countries that we [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=228.16s)]
*  do have alliances with. Well, the huge X factor too is what Ben Rhodes, Obama's security guy, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  described as what we could have as a catastrophic success. You take out the nuclear arsenal and then [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=239.36s)]
*  what? What is regime change? Maybe you could describe what that would mean. There's not [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=248.0s)]
*  someone waiting in the wings in Iran. Although there's not a lot of- It's not Thomas Jefferson. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  There's very little support for the regime, 10 to 15% according to Kareem Sajidpour, who's got a good [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  handle on things. I had Yasmin Vesugian on a moment ago and she was talking about the people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=262.8s)]
*  she knows in Iran, her family there. There's not a lot of popular support for this oppressive regime. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=269.12s)]
*  They torture people. They throw them in prison. They killed Massa Amini for not wearing a head [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=275.2s)]
*  scarf. Massive protests, but they haven't been able to knock this regime off. I just think that's a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=279.68s)]
*  kind of naive, weirdly idealistic hope. I mean, regime change is not something that has worked [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=287.76s)]
*  for the US. It didn't work in Libya. It didn't work in Iraq. You have to let the people do it [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=294.88s)]
*  themselves. Yeah, I mean, that's democracy, isn't it? But they're a religious country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=299.28s)]
*  They're a Shia country. I mean, there's not going to be, as you said, Mark, some Thomas Jefferson [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=306.4s)]
*  figure that comes forward and says, I'm going to be bigger. Let me ask about domestic politics. I [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=310.24s)]
*  want to go back to that. We had JD Vance posting a very long message on social media defending [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=313.28s)]
*  Donald Trump, saying that he's always been consistent about Iran. You can't have a country [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=318.0s)]
*  like Iran have a nuclear weapon. JD Vance, who was an isolationist, who has said that, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=322.08s)]
*  you know, campaigned with Donald Trump on no foreign wars, didn't want to get involved in Ukraine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=326.72s)]
*  He's turning on this. Tulsi Gabbard pushed off to the side. He's fighting with Tucker Carlson publicly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=331.2s)]
*  What's it? Is this really going to be a moment that breaks apart this coalition? I mean, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=339.12s)]
*  I don't know if Theo Vaughn is an emotional Donald Trump supporter, like some of the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=343.12s)]
*  hardcore bases, but Theo Vaughn and the people who listen to him are the ones that helped Donald [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=347.6s)]
*  Trump win this time. Well, that's exactly right. But I mean, the tell again is look what happened [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=352.48s)]
*  to Tulsi Gabbard and look what JD Vance is doing. And that shift, I think he's reading, he's great [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  at reading the tea leaves and where Donald Trump is going. So I think that's a real tell about where [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=362.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is at the moment, which is headed toward pulling the trigger with Bibi. Think so? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=366.88s)]
*  I do. All right, gentlemen, we're going to leave that conversation here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiijV_59iNI&t=373.52s)]
