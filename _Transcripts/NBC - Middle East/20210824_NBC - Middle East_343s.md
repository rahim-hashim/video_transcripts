# Rep. Crow: 'Not Going To Be Possible' To Get Americans, Afghan Allies Out
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY)
*  Congressman, thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=0.0s)]
*  I know the briefing was classified, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=1.6s)]
*  but from what you were told, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=3.04s)]
*  are we going to be able to get all of the Americans [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=4.74s)]
*  and our Afghan allies out before time runs out? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=7.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Andrea. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=11.18s)]
*  And I obviously am not going to talk about specifics [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=12.58s)]
*  of any classified briefing, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=14.42s)]
*  but what remains true right now [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=15.58s)]
*  is what's been true for the past week, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=17.62s)]
*  and the answer to that question is no. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=19.28s)]
*  It is not going to be possible to get American citizens out [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=21.52s)]
*  and our Afghan partners and their families [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=26.0s)]
*  out between now and the end of the month. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=27.82s)]
*  That's why there is broad and deep bipartisan support [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=29.76s)]
*  in Congress and across the country to extend the deadline [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=32.8s)]
*  to make sure that we're doing what's necessary [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=37.14s)]
*  to get folks out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=38.6s)]
*  The end of this mission should come [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=39.74s)]
*  not based on a calendar date. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=41.2s)]
*  It should come when we accomplish the mission. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=43.0s)]
*  Now, I was just seeing that Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=46.18s)]
*  basically said the same thing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  when he came out of the meeting as you did, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  that we should extend the mission. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=52.22s)]
*  But should we extend the mission now [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=54.32s)]
*  that the Taliban have said that that's a hard and firm date? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  If you were commander in chief, would you do that? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=60.66s)]
*  Yeah, if I were the president, I would do that, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=64.1s)]
*  because I'm not concerned about what the Taliban thinks [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=66.36s)]
*  we should or shouldn't do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=68.94s)]
*  We have an obligation to protect American citizens, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=70.24s)]
*  and we have a moral obligation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=72.84s)]
*  to protect our partners and friends. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=74.1s)]
*  That's not without risk. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=76.1s)]
*  But if we're not willing to use the United States military [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  to protect American citizens and our friends and allies, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=80.24s)]
*  then what are we willing to use it for? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=83.02s)]
*  That is a core mission of the United States military. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=84.42s)]
*  It's not without risk. It's complicated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  It's risky. I know that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=88.84s)]
*  I understand that from my time as an Army ranger [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=90.38s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=92.56s)]
*  But that's what has to happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=94.28s)]
*  That is the reality that we're in right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=96.48s)]
*  We set that August 31st deadline weeks ago, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=98.62s)]
*  months ago in a different world under different conditions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=102.16s)]
*  We're now in a different world right now, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=108.2s)]
*  and we're going to be able to talk about in the months ahead [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=110.4s)]
*  why that happened. But it did happen, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=112.28s)]
*  and now we have to make sure that we're making the changes, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=114.8s)]
*  the revisions to that deadline to get the mission done. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=117.04s)]
*  Are you hearing from translators, drivers, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=120.84s)]
*  other comrades, Afghan allies with whom you worked? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=123.84s)]
*  What are you hearing from the region [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=127.2s)]
*  or from others who have now resettled? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=128.8s)]
*  Yeah, for the past week, my office has actually received [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=131.52s)]
*  and processed over 1,200 requests for evacuation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=134.24s)]
*  and for processing of special immigrant visas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=137.88s)]
*  I talked to another fellow House member [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=139.72s)]
*  whose office has received 4,000 requests. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=141.78s)]
*  My phone is ringing off the hook nonstop. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm getting texts, I'm getting signal messages, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm getting emails. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=149.28s)]
*  People are sending me passport photos [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  and photos of their children begging for help. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  These folks, these numbers, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  when we're talking about SIV numbers, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=160.22s)]
*  special immigrant visas, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  these people have names and faces to so many of us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  That's why we formed the Honoring Our Promises [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=166.76s)]
*  Working Group, which is a bipartisan working group [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=168.72s)]
*  in the House back in May, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=170.66s)]
*  to actually say these are our friends, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=173.7s)]
*  these are our comrades. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  They protected us, they fought with us, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=177.61999999999998s)]
*  they served with us, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  and now it's our obligation to do the same for them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=179.82s)]
*  How did you feel when the president [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=183.6s)]
*  and other top officials blamed the Afghan military [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=185.1s)]
*  for the collapse and the Taliban takeover? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=188.82s)]
*  Do you think that, from what you know, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=192.6s)]
*  once Bagram Air Base was closed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=194.94s)]
*  and they saw that we had left, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  do you think that that was entirely fair to them? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=199.44s)]
*  Well, I certainly think at the leadership levels, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=202.48s)]
*  I think President Ghani left his country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=204.48s)]
*  and he left his countrymen behind. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=207.72s)]
*  And I certainly think history is going to be damning to him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=210.04s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=213.0s)]
*  And certain other senior leaders [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  who got on private planes and helicopters [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=215.6s)]
*  and left the country [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=218.04s)]
*  and left people to fight for themselves, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=218.88s)]
*  there's no doubt that history [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=221.44s)]
*  is not going to treat those folks well, nor should it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=222.44s)]
*  But I think we have to be very careful [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=225.8s)]
*  when we're talking about the rank and file, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=227.28s)]
*  because let's not forget that tens of thousands [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  of Afghan soldiers have been fighting for 20 years [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=231.52s)]
*  and have given their lives, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=235.12s)]
*  tens of thousands have given their lives [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=235.76s)]
*  of fighting for their country and fighting for democracy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=237.76s)]
*  and fighting for their families. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=240.2s)]
*  And I think we should not forget that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=242.08s)]
*  And it's very hard to sit, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=244.96s)]
*  I'll say it's very easy to sit in the comfort [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=247.46s)]
*  of a living room in the United States of America [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=249.72s)]
*  and cast dispersions on an Afghan soldier [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=252.12s)]
*  who's sitting at a remote checkpoint [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=255.44s)]
*  when the Taliban rolls up. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=257.16s)]
*  It's very hard to predict what happens [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=258.92s)]
*  in the hearts and minds of a man [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=260.74s)]
*  when they're thinking about their children, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=262.92s)]
*  when they're thinking about their spouse. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=265.04s)]
*  And I think we have to be very careful [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  about how we judge those folks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=268.36s)]
*  And what do you think is going to happen to them [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=271.36s)]
*  and other Afghan allies and to the women [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=274.76s)]
*  with the Taliban once we leave? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=277.8s)]
*  Well, I think that is a story that's not written yet, Andrea, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=280.88s)]
*  and that's why we're talking about the mission right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=283.68s)]
*  We don't know how this ends. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=286.42s)]
*  We don't know how the story ends. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=288.86s)]
*  That's a decision that's in our hands [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=290.68s)]
*  over the next couple of days. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=292.44s)]
*  The administration has to make a decision [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=294.52s)]
*  about whether or not they're gonna move the deadline [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=296.28s)]
*  to get that mission done. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=298.44s)]
*  We have the opportunity to save tens of thousands of lives, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=299.84s)]
*  the lives of our friends, the lives of our partners. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=303.2s)]
*  And I think we should do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=305.92s)]
*  So we don't know. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=307.56s)]
*  And I think sitting here today, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=309.36s)]
*  that's the singular focus, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=310.64s)]
*  is saving as many folks as we can. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=312.04s)]
*  Jason Crowe, former Army Ranger and paratrooper, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=314.84s)]
*  Iraq and Afghanistan from Colorado. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=317.84s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=320.2s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXcSzdBakY&t=321.68s)]
