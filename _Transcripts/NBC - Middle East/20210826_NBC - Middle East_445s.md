# Veteran On Afghan Allies: There’s No Future For These People In That Hell
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4)
*  Matt Zeller, we know you have extensive contacts in Afghanistan as you've been trying over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=0.0s)]
*  the last couple of weeks to help evacuate people. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=4.4s)]
*  What are you telling your contacts and what are folks who are still there telling you? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=7.96s)]
*  Well, we're telling them what's already been shared on this, you know, your broadcast. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=12.08s)]
*  I agree with the analysis that's been previously given. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=17.36s)]
*  The evacuation is over. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=19.8s)]
*  We are now leaving. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=21.92s)]
*  The gates at the airport are being welded shut. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  We're telling our contacts that they need to make preparations to what's called go to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=26.6s)]
*  ground. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  We've asked them and instructed them to burn all documents that tie them to U.S. forces [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=32.44s)]
*  to take pictures of those documents and upload them into the cloud so that they can be accessible [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=38.24s)]
*  later should they need them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=41.96s)]
*  The general advice has been given is that they need to make it seem as if that we never [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=44.24s)]
*  knew one another. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Our lives simply did not ever transpire. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  And then what we're going to try to do is what we now are calling phase two, the Afghan [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=53.36s)]
*  Underground Railroad. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=57.12s)]
*  We're going to begin trying to figure out ways to get them out of the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=58.12s)]
*  I agree there needs to be a humanitarian corridor established via an air bridge or some type [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=61.28s)]
*  of land crossing to neighboring countries to allow Afghans who want to leave Taliban [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=66.52s)]
*  controlled Afghanistan to get out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=71.16s)]
*  There's going to be some clandestine efforts. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=73.68s)]
*  I'm sure that will be undertaken both by governments and by private individuals. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=75.64s)]
*  Those efforts are going to need to be supported. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=80.76s)]
*  This is going to take years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=82.92s)]
*  You know, the easy part of this evacuation actually were the last couple of weeks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  And the Biden administration should be commended for getting as many folks as they could get [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=88.08s)]
*  out. But now the reality is that there's actually probably around one hundred and seventy five [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=91.64s)]
*  thousand or more people that we're tracking that are going to need to be evacuated. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=97.52s)]
*  That's going to take years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  I realize that the public's interest is going to wane. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  It'll go on to whatever next crisis comes up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=105.84s)]
*  But those of us who have committed to this are not going anywhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  August 31st is just a date on the calendar for us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=112.0s)]
*  We're going to continue this effort until our mission is complete, no matter how long it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=114.56s)]
*  takes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=117.92s)]
*  For Americans whose only connection to Afghanistan are the images like these we're seeing on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=119.24s)]
*  the screen, which I think is most Americans, help us understand. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=124.52s)]
*  I mean, if Afghan allies aren't able to get out by August 31st, if they're not already [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=128.2s)]
*  near the airport or in Kabul, is there any hope of getting out? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=134.2s)]
*  I mean, is there any any reason to think that they could go dark as you as you use the phrase [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=137.28s)]
*  for a month or two and then ultimately try to find safe passage to a neighboring country? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=142.72s)]
*  Is that within the realm of possibility? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=147.8s)]
*  It depends. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=150.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=151.88s)]
*  So there's a lot of concern that the Taliban has taken control of the Internet service providers [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=152.88s)]
*  in Afghanistan and the cell phone providers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=156.44s)]
*  And should they choose to set those services down and shut them off, it's going to be extremely [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=158.84s)]
*  difficult to communicate with those with those individuals. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=164.12s)]
*  So we're trying to work on ways to maintain communications just into our people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  The next thing is that the Taliban don't have complete effective control over the country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=172.32s)]
*  A lot of their attention right now is in Kabul and in the growing resistance, which is actually [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=176.24s)]
*  the legitimate governor of Afghanistan, the remnants of it up in Pantshire. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=180.96s)]
*  They're going to be probably focusing their attention on that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  So our best opportunity to get people out to be the next coming months. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=188.24s)]
*  I would argue that as this goes on, as they are able to consolidate and really begin to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=191.4s)]
*  effectively control the inner parts of Afghanistan and its border crossings, it's going to be [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=196.56s)]
*  increasingly more difficult unless there's some type of negotiated agreement with them [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  that would allow for, like I said, a humanitarian corridor to be to be put in place. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=206.96s)]
*  But you know, the prospect is very dark. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=211.0s)]
*  I mean, let's be clear for Afghans who now live there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=212.96s)]
*  Imagine if you woke up tomorrow morning and if you were a woman, you couldn't go out of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  your house without a male escort. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=220.28s)]
*  You are suddenly fired from your job and from life. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=221.6s)]
*  And in this country, we have a huge debate over whether what we should be teaching in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=224.48s)]
*  our classrooms and whether or not versions of history should skew one side of the aisle [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=228.6s)]
*  or the other. Imagine tomorrow it was compulsory to be taught Islamic Sharia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=233.88s)]
*  And that was going to be the basis of your education, that all sports, all arts, all [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=239.32s)]
*  cultural aspects of life that you could celebrate that were considered now to be sinful were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=244.8s)]
*  banned. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=248.96s)]
*  That's why one of those individuals who were clinging to the side of the C-17 at the beginning [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=250.12s)]
*  of all this, he fell off, was a 17 year old kid. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=254.24s)]
*  He was part of the Afghan youth national soccer team. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=257.56s)]
*  And he was trying to get out because the soccer stadium that he had spent his whole life [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=260.52s)]
*  dreaming and playing in is now going to turn once again to the site of mass executions. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=264.16s)]
*  So, yeah, there's a it's a dark day ahead for our Afghan brothers and sisters. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=269.44s)]
*  But they need to be clear. There's still this digital Dunkirk movement and we're not going [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=273.36s)]
*  anywhere. We are committed to getting every single one of us out of the way. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=277.6s)]
*  We're going to get rid of them out by whatever means it takes, for however long it takes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=280.0s)]
*  Before today's attacks, there were reports that there were as many as two hundred fifty [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  thousand Afghans who would be effectively stuck in Afghanistan. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=290.0s)]
*  Folks who had worked alongside the U.S. mission over the last 20 years. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  I heard you say that you estimate there to be about one hundred seventy five thousand [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=298.0s)]
*  people who would be qualified for these expedited visas to get out of the country. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  It appears that most of those folks will stay there after the U.S. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=306.56s)]
*  wraps up its engagement there at the end of the month. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  What does that do to the U.S. standing in the world in your view, Matt? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=313.2s)]
*  Well, it all depends. You know, I again, I hope people can make the critical distinction [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=318.4s)]
*  between our government's decisions and and what the American people are trying to do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  The the fiasco in Afghanistan is, you know, is unfortunately held by all of us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  It's the responsibility of successive administrations. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=333.28s)]
*  Mark Hatfield, who was on your program earlier, is correct. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=336.0s)]
*  This began with the gross mismanagement and failure of the special immigration visa [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=338.56s)]
*  program, which spans multiple administrations in both parties. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=343.08s)]
*  A lot of it is held by the Trump administration and their absolute, you know, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=347.48s)]
*  purposeful malfeasance, which I think is finally now being brought to light. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=351.52s)]
*  That created a massive backlog of individuals who needed to be evacuated now [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=355.84s)]
*  here at the last moment. I've been very clear in my statements. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=360.96s)]
*  I don't need to rearticulate how I feel about how this current evacuation could have gone [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=364.2s)]
*  had our warnings had been heeded. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=368.44s)]
*  But I really do truly, you know, have some concerns that we have set a scary example. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  We trusted security in Kabul to terrorists and we now unfortunately see what it has befallen. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=377.92s)]
*  If you've seen any of my television appearances or anyone in our coalition, you'll note that none of us [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=384.32s)]
*  ever talked about this type of attack before until now because we were afraid of this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=388.44s)]
*  We didn't want to try to inspire anybody with our rhetoric. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  But this has always been our nightmare scenario with these types of attacks in those [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=396.44s)]
*  crowds against the most vulnerable. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=400.56s)]
*  And so for the Afghans left behind, you know, this is they're going to become their daily [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=403.04s)]
*  existence and their daily reality is that they're stuck in between the Taliban on one side, who are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=407.68s)]
*  abhorrent and evil and ISIS Khorasan, who are also even more abhorrent and evil. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=413.68s)]
*  That's why we have to get them out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=420.48s)]
*  There's no future for these people in that hell. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVSO-qXNB4&t=421.92s)]
