# Richard Engel: 'Ominous feeling' that war could escalate at any moment
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0)
*  Israel has ordered the evacuation of 30 border villages in southern Lebanon as its military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=0.0s)]
*  pushes forward with what it's calling targeted ground raids in the area. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=4.8s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel live from the southern city [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=8.68s)]
*  of Tyre. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Richard, what does it look like there? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Well, already you can see that streets are starting to empty out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=16.96s)]
*  Israel has ordered these mass evacuations, more than 30 villages specifically, and told [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=22.2s)]
*  Lebanese people not to come below the Latani River. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=28.24s)]
*  We are now below the Latani River in their vehicles. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=31.88s)]
*  And a lot of streets are starting to look like this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=34.88s)]
*  There are very few people out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=37.4s)]
*  People are nervous. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=39.28s)]
*  There is an ominous feeling now that this war could escalate really at any moment. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=40.28s)]
*  Israel's ground incursion into Lebanon is underway. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  A cross-border drive to attack Hezbollah on its own terrain. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  U.S. officials tell NBC News Israel informed the Biden administration ahead of time, describing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  the operation as short, days, not weeks, and limited in its geographic reach. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=59.6s)]
*  I want to make it clear. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=64.44s)]
*  Our war is with Hezbollah, not with the people of Lebanon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=65.8s)]
*  U.S. officials tell NBC News the administration is concerned Israel's operation could expand. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  And this morning, the Israeli military issued an ominous warning, telling Lebanese not to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  travel in vehicles south of the Latani River, suggesting a large part of southern Lebanon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=83.68s)]
*  could become an open war zone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=89.92s)]
*  Israel says its goal is to create a buffer zone free of Hezbollah from the Latani River [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  to the Israeli border to prevent the Iranian-backed militia from using the area to launch attacks [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=97.56s)]
*  against Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=103.04s)]
*  We've just crossed into southern Lebanon, the area that Israel hopes to make its buffer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  zone. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  Almost no one is heading south. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  All the traffic we're seeing are vehicles, motorcycles heading north. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=110.92s)]
*  And this morning, Hezbollah fired more rockets at Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=115.48s)]
*  Hezbollah claims to have 100,000 fighters. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=119.84s)]
*  Independent analysts say the actual number may be closer to half of that, still a major [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=122.76s)]
*  dedicated force dug in on its own terrain with years of preparation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  But Israel has weakened Hezbollah significantly, killing the group's leader, decimating its [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=133.4s)]
*  chain of command and booby-trapping its communications. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=138.12s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he sees this war as part of a larger battle against [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=142.28s)]
*  all of Iran's proxies in the Middle East. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=147.28s)]
*  Yesterday, he addressed the Iranian people directly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=150.04s)]
*  There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=153.32s)]
*  There's nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=157.12s)]
*  Hezbollah's deputy leader vowed the group will emerge victorious. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=162.12s)]
*  Willie, the Pentagon has said it is sending thousands of reinforcements and squadrons [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=165.68s)]
*  of fighter jets. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  And there is that feeling here I was talking about, that ominous feeling that this war [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=173.06s)]
*  could escalate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=177.56s)]
*  So far, both Israel and Hezbollah say they haven't engaged in any direct combat. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  It seems that the Israelis went in. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=184.0s)]
*  They're staying very close to the Israel-Lebanon border for now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  People are afraid that the war could escalate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=190.66s)]
*  They're leaving this area. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  It seems that Israel went in, tried to see if they could pull out Hezbollah, draw them [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=194.44s)]
*  into an open fight. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=199.0s)]
*  But at this stage, it doesn't seem that Hezbollah took the bait. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=200.4s)]
*  But these are still early days. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=203.5s)]
*  So Richard, what would that escalation that, as we've heard also from officials, that they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=205.72s)]
*  fear so much, what would that escalation potentially look like? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=211.24s)]
*  Is Iran actually ready, not through its proxies, but face-to-face, to have a confrontation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=215.52s)]
*  with Israel? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=220.76s)]
*  It seems unlikely at this stage that Iran would engage. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=222.6s)]
*  Iran didn't respond after the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran, even though it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=228.12s)]
*  promised to. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran has continued to say that it will respond at a time and place of its choosing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  Even Hezbollah at this stage doesn't seem like it wants to confront the Israeli military [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=239.64s)]
*  when the Israeli military is on the move, it's aggressive, it has the U.S. military [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  behind it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=248.92s)]
*  What Hezbollah seems to be, and this is a bit of speculation, but when you listen to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=250.0s)]
*  what Hezbollah is saying, is they would rather draw the Israelis in, draw them into a ground [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=254.16s)]
*  war, engage them in a long guerrilla fight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=259.4s)]
*  But Hezbollah has taken a lot of blows recently. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Its command and control structure has been badly damaged. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=265.46s)]
*  It still has many fighters. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=268.32s)]
*  But an escalation at this stage potentially involving Iran seems unlikely. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  More likely it seems that it would be a full Israeli push deep into southern Lebanon, deep [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=276.0s)]
*  into the area where I am right now, and then engaging the tens of thousands of Hezbollah [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=283.52s)]
*  fighters who say they are ready to confront them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=288.28s)]
*  Willie? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=291.72s)]
*  NBC's Richard Angle reporting live from southern Lebanon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=292.72s)]
*  Thank you Richard, and please stay safe there on the ground. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=295.44s)]
*  We appreciate it as always. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=297.6s)]
*  Claire, it has been stunning for the last couple of weeks what Israel has been able [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=299.48s)]
*  to do to Hezbollah, whether it's putting bombs in their pockets effectively with their [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=303.64s)]
*  phones and their pagers and their walkie talkies, or taking out Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  a long time directly in a strike there, and now putting troops on the ground. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=314.44s)]
*  Where do you see this headed? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=319.28s)]
*  Good question. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=321.28s)]
*  I think there won't probably be any kind of shift until after our elections, and I'm not [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=322.88s)]
*  sure there will be then. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=330.52s)]
*  I remember going to Israel for the first time as a member of the Armed Services Committee, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=332.24s)]
*  and my visit there was all about their military. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  I remember thinking, these are folks that live in a very dangerous neighborhood, but [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=339.84s)]
*  they are really preparing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=344.96s)]
*  The level of training in their military, the level of their intelligence capability, really [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=347.96s)]
*  unsurpassed in that area of the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=355.32s)]
*  They are really, really good at this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=358.64s)]
*  You see what they've done using that intelligence, taking out the leadership, the command and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=361.82s)]
*  control before they try to create a buffer. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=366.58s)]
*  It's very strategic and frankly has probably given Netanyahu a little bit of a lifeline [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=370.82s)]
*  politically, at least for the immediate future. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=375.86s)]
*  The strength of the Israeli intelligence so on display in the last week or so, again, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=378.98s)]
*  makes the failures of October 7th that much more mystifying. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=383.02s)]
*  Senior White House officials told me last night there's at least a possibility they think [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=386.42s)]
*  that Iran may do some sort of face-saving measure here, maybe like they did in April, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=390.06s)]
*  like a somewhat telegraphed rocket strike that was fairly easily picked out of the air [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=394.14s)]
*  by the Iron Dome, supported by U.S. assets in the area. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=399.26s)]
*  They do believe there's a real reluctance for Iran to escalate much further because [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=403.3s)]
*  if they were to draw Israel into a full war, though there would be certainly calamity for [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=407.66s)]
*  the region, there's a real sense that Israel, with the U.S.'s support, that that would be [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=412.38s)]
*  potentially regime-ending for Iran. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=416.22s)]
*  That's not a fight they want to pick. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=418.06s)]
*  President Biden saying again yesterday, along with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, they [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=419.5s)]
*  support Israel's right to defend itself but want to continue diplomatic pursuit of some [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  kind of a ceasefire there. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqRC-w5BD0&t=427.58s)]
