*  I'll repeat the these are coming from aircraft carriers in the region and the Red Sea [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=64.97999999999999s)]
*  targeting Houthi rebels in in in Yemen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=70.88s)]

*  We're looking at Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and precision guided missiles [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  This is in addition to at the beginning of the show me telling you that there had been attacks earlier this afternoon in Yemen [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  Those seem to have been part of the ongoing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=105.48s)]
*  Attacks between US forces and Yemeni Houthi forces. This is different [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=108.34s)]
*  This is part of the larger attack that we saw starting last night. We're gonna get more information on this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=114.7s)]
*  I want to go to Matt Bradley in Tel Aviv who was following this very closely with me [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=119.92s)]
*  Matt this is a big attack [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=125.1s)]
*  Yeah, this is a big attack and we've been hearing from the Pentagon that there would be continuous attacks [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=129.56s)]
*  There would be weeks of attacks and reprisal but you know [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=133.88s)]
*  This is part of an effort to continue to attack against these Iranian proxies [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=136.72s)]
*  But we've been seeing attacks like this not necessarily to the same degree but [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=141.66s)]
*  Continuous for the last several months [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=146.88s)]
*  We've actually been seeing attacks against Iranian proxy groups in Iraq and Syria for the past several months as well in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=149.0s)]
*  Refribution for the attacks that we were seeing almost daily by those groups in Iraq and Syria. This is part of that continuum [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=155.92s)]
*  This is part of those continuous attacks this time against the Houthis in Yemen who have been taking strikes against international shipping [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=162.88s)]
*  And then also against US destroyers and other naval assets in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aden for the past several months as well [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=170.6s)]
*  So this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=177.68s)]
*  Again, Ali the big surprise that's going to be coming here is if the US attacks the Iranian mainland inside [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=180.84s)]
*  Iranian borders or Iranian naval assets in the Red Sea or in the Gulf of Aden or anywhere in that region [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  In the Strait of Hormuz, so these this hasn't yet happened yet [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=195.55999999999997s)]
*  What we're seeing now is an increase in the degree to which we've been seeing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  Reprisal attacks by the United States against those attacks that were done by these proxy groups before [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=204.27999999999997s)]
*  So if we see a real big breakout from that and that would represent something like attacking the Iranian mainland [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=210.27999999999997s)]
*  Then we know that we're in the territory of really ratcheting up the pressure and bringing us further to a region-wide war [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=217.64s)]
*  Which is an eventuality that the US and Iran itself have said they are trying to avoid and as we know [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=225.04s)]
*  And any war in the Middle East the main burden would be carried by the civilians throughout the entire region Ali [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=232.76s)]
*  You [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_JqXusF3os&t=247.64s)]
