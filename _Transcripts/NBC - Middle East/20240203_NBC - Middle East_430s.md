# What might come next in the tiered U.S. military retaliation against Iranian proxies
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY)
*  The U.S. airstrikes hit more than four locations in Syria, three in Iraq. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=0.0s)]
*  What could be the next phase in what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said would be a multi-tiered [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=8.1s)]
*  response? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=12.8s)]
*  What more could we see in the coming days? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=13.8s)]
*  Joining us now, Jeremy Basch, the former chief of staff, to Secretary Leon Panetta at the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=15.24s)]
*  Pentagon and the CIA. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Also with us today, MSNBC military analyst and Medal of Honor recipient, Colonel Jack [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=21.94s)]
*  Jacobs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=26.64s)]
*  Jeremy, first U.N. Security Council spokesman, John Kirby said the targets were carefully [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=27.76s)]
*  selected to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=32.68s)]
*  In fact, that was one reason why they were waiting for cloud cover to clear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=34.84s)]
*  What else could the Pentagon do? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=40.52s)]
*  What else did they take into consideration when picking the targets? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=43.68s)]
*  And why did they wait a number of days since last Sunday's killing the deadly strikes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  that killed three soldiers? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=53.28s)]
*  Well, Andrea, I think everybody expected that the United States would have to respond militarily [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=56.0s)]
*  to the killing of three U.S. service members in Jordan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=60.48s)]
*  That really wasn't in doubt. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=64.0s)]
*  But then the questions unfold. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=65.96s)]
*  What would be the targets? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=67.72s)]
*  What would be the platforms used? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=68.9s)]
*  What would be the weapon-earing? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=70.8s)]
*  What would the United States say publicly about these attacks and about its efforts [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=72.42s)]
*  to go after Iranian targets specifically? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=77.4s)]
*  And what would we communicate both publicly but also privately to our allies and partners? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=80.68s)]
*  And so that takes quite a bit of coordination. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=85.28s)]
*  It's a highly complicated operation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=87.76s)]
*  The president just doesn't sit there and push a button and these attacks unfold. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=89.4s)]
*  As noted in some of your setup reporting, some of the platforms used included aircraft [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=94.12s)]
*  coming all the way from Texas, B-1B bombers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=99.44s)]
*  These are large, actually nuclear-capable bombers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=103.12s)]
*  They're part of our nuclear triad. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=106.4s)]
*  They can carry and hold much larger weapons. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=108.72s)]
*  They can fly with weapons that have much more standoff capabilities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=111.88s)]
*  So they don't have to get right over the target. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  They can stay back because of air defenses or maybe political air rights that, for example, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=116.84s)]
*  the Iraqi government might have been holding back. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=121.68s)]
*  And so this was a fairly complicated, I think comprehensive operation, well done, well executed, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=124.8s)]
*  professionally executed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=132.24s)]
*  And this was the right level because we were going after Iranian targets, specifically [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=133.54s)]
*  calling out Iran as the author of all of this unrest in the region, including the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=138.12s)]
*  attacks against U.S. service members, troops and bases, but not attacking inside Iran to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=142.4s)]
*  escalate a wider direct conflict between the United States and Iran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=148.32s)]
*  So I think this was exactly the right level and well executed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=152.52s)]
*  And Colonel Jacobs, what military assets were used in the U.S. response? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=157.28s)]
*  Jeremy talked about the B-1Bs, but what about the significance of the weapons used as well? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=161.56s)]
*  Well, precision guided munitions obviously is the way to go. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=168.56s)]
*  There have been a lot of people talking about how we need to use dumb bombs instead. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=171.52s)]
*  But there was a concern, of course, collateral damage. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=176.8s)]
*  It's interesting to note that these kinds of weapons can be launched, precision guided [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=181.08s)]
*  munitions can be launched from a variety of platforms, including ships and aircraft that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=185.12s)]
*  are located on ships in the region. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=192.32s)]
*  But we wanted to keep those assets, aircraft carriers and the planes that carry them and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=195.16s)]
*  the planes that are on them, just in case there was some sort of escalation and those [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=202.84s)]
*  aircraft would be required to do some further counterstrike. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=208.96s)]
*  It's interesting to note that we have a very large target list that gets modified from [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=212.8s)]
*  time to time as intelligence dictates. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  So there are lots more targets there that we can strike but have elected so far not [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=221.2s)]
*  to strike because if we strike all of them, then we have nothing left to do except to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=227.98s)]
*  really escalate the conflict, which the United States does not want to do, Andrea. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=233.9s)]
*  And Jeremy, let's talk about what could come next. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  A lot of talk about cyber being one of the things that could be done in addition to these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  strikes, which were kinetic. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=247.78s)]
*  What are our capabilities in cyber and who would we be targeting? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=250.5s)]
*  Well, I suspect the United States, mainly led by U.S. Cyber Command out of Fort Meade, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=254.34s)]
*  Maryland, has a range of options on the table and they've probably been conducting operations [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=260.86s)]
*  against Iranian surrogates and proxies both to collect information but also ultimately [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=267.42s)]
*  to debilitate their command and control and their ability to operate. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=272.54s)]
*  And so if cyber is part of the weapons suite and in modern warfare, of course, Andrea, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=276.26s)]
*  it always is, then undoubtedly, and if there are opportunities, then undoubtedly the U.S. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=280.94s)]
*  will employ them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=286.1s)]
*  They have the benefit, Andrea, of being obviously less visible. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=287.1s)]
*  Therefore, the United States doesn't have to explain them publicly and they can be highly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=290.26s)]
*  effective. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=295.66s)]
*  But I think in this case, given the fact that Iran had been attacking our troops, our bases, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=296.66s)]
*  our personnel in the region, we were going to have to respond with missiles, with lead [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=302.9s)]
*  on target. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  There was no way that the president of the United States was going to be able to tolerate [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  this and though it took a couple of days and there was some grousing in Washington about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=312.14s)]
*  why was it taking so long, I think, again, this was exactly the right response. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  I do think it's important to note, Andrea, just one final point here, which is that all [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  of these attacks against America, our allies, our partners in the region since October 7th, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  this isn't a coincidence that Hamas attacked Israel, that Hezbollah has been attacking [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=330.9s)]
*  Israel, that the Houthis have been attacking ships, that Iranian proxies have been attacking [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=335.14s)]
*  American forces. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=339.12s)]
*  This is Iran trying in the region to prevent Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=340.2s)]
*  from doing a three-way diplomatic deal, which is what was on the table in the fall of 2023. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=346.02s)]
*  And at this hour, six Americans are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=351.84s)]
*  Let's not forget, six Americans are being held. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=356.7s)]
*  This is an attack not just against Israel. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=360.1s)]
*  This has been an attack against the United States, against our citizens, against our [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=362.5s)]
*  people, our troops. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  And President Biden went to Dover Air Force Base to see the dignified transfer ceremony [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  of three service members this week as a result of those attacks. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  Those young service members, they're barely in their 20s, two women and one man, their [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  parents talking about their aspirations, the volunteer army. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=389.66s)]
*  This was their career path to rising in society. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=393.3s)]
*  And of course, the two of them, the two women were posthumously promoted to sergeant in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  what their mom said were very meaningful promotions by the president in his phone calls. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqW6lkUgWqY&t=402.78000000000003s)]
