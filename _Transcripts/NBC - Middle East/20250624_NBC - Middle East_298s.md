# 'Careful to cross' Trump': Middle Eastern nations largely silent amid U.S. involvement
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU)
*  Joining us now, Eurasia Group Managing Director Faraz Maksad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=0.0s)]
*  Faraz, thanks for being here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=3.84s)]
*  How's the region doing, the ceasefire announcement and the U.S. involvement? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=5.28s)]
*  I'm a gasp of relief for most in the region to see that, in fact, this did remain contained. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=10.84s)]
*  We saw yesterday the much anticipated Iranian retaliation against the United States for the United States hit on the nuclear facilities in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=17.32s)]
*  Ferdow. That was carefully telegraphed ahead of time from the Iranians to make sure that the U.S. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=26.36s)]
*  then does not respond in a much more aggressive way that can threaten the stability of the regime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=34.84s)]
*  It's rarely the case that ballistic missiles fly and they demonstrate weakness rather than strength. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=41.12s)]
*  Here, the Iranian government, the Iranian regime, clearly very weak, looking for de-escalation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=47.56s)]
*  And I think that's what ultimately opened the pathway for President Trump making that surprise announcement of the ceasefire between [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  Israel and the Iranian government. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  When it comes to the U.S. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  strikes on Iran, the governments of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, they both came short of condemning the U.S. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=64.24s)]
*  action. Qatar and the UAE did not even mention the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you expect Middle Eastern nations to just simply stay on the sidelines in this conflict? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=72.92s)]
*  I don't. And those statements were very telling. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=79.12s)]
*  You're right to point them out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=81.76s)]
*  Listen, these countries, these Arab Muslim countries have very firmly condemned the Israeli attack on Iran since it started [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=83.2s)]
*  12 days ago, did not do so when it came to the United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  One, very careful to cross a volatile President Trump, want to make sure that they maintain the best of relationship. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  President Trump was in the region only a couple of weeks ago. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  Two, have an interest very much in playing the role of facilitator, mediator. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=105.04s)]
*  These are status quo powers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=110.4s)]
*  A lot of them have their national agendas, their visions of where they want to take the countries investing in their economies [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=111.8s)]
*  and developing them. They don't want to see this conflict drag on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=117.2s)]
*  They also want to very much kind of defend and hedge against possible blowback. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=120.64s)]
*  Iran attacking American bases, energy facilities inside of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=125.44s)]
*  So they want to play in both sides and hedge and play the role of facilitator. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=131.76s)]
*  And that's why we saw these statements that were not outright condemning the American attack on the Iranian nuclear facility. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  And reporting from NBC News, Israel's highly destructive dismantling of Iranian influence in Lebanon was quietly welcomed by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=142.32s)]
*  those outside the group space of Shiite supporters, even as Lebanese leaders continued to publicly oppose Israel and champion [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=150.0s)]
*  the Palestinian cause. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm curious, how has Iran's influence in the region changed? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Iran has been dealt a devastating blow since October 7th, these attacks by Hamas against Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=163.68s)]
*  We saw Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu systematically go after Iran's forward defense strategy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=170.48s)]
*  It's the employment of these proxy groups throughout the region to come at Israel indirectly through Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, militias in Iraq. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=184.84s)]
*  And so we saw Israel systematically go after them, weaken that defense, this forward defense strategy that the Iranians have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  and then go after Iran proper. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=196.24s)]
*  And so this has been nothing short of a strategic success for the Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=198.32s)]
*  The question really is today, does Bibi Netanyahu quit while he's ahead? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=203.16s)]
*  Or is there a risk of wanting to push further? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  I think that is the risk that will have him perhaps butt heads with President Trump moving forward. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=210.84s)]
*  Trump very much wanting to see that ceasefire in place, wanting to put back on the Israelis and also on the Iranians. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=216.2s)]
*  Very quickly for us, if you will, the Trump administration has called this the 12 day war. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=221.92s)]
*  What do you think? Is it over? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=227.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think this is classic Trump, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=231.0s)]
*  He wants to put a brand on this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=233.28s)]
*  It's an emphasis on the fact that it was only 12 days. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=235.0s)]
*  We all know that there is an isolationist trend within the MAGA movement that really didn't want to see U.S. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=237.96s)]
*  involvement in another Middle Eastern war. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=244.24s)]
*  For Trump, it was one and done. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  He took that strike against the nuclear program. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  He wants to bring this to an end and declare a victory. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=252.12s)]
*  I think it's going to be a lot more checkered than that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=255.12s)]
*  There's still that pending question of some 409 kilograms of highly enriched uranium that the Iranians moved out of Fordo. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=257.32s)]
*  Where those are, will the Iranians attempt to enrich them further to nuclear grade, 90 percent plus? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Very thorny diplomatic issues ahead that will need to be negotiated. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=269.72s)]
*  So maybe coercive diplomacy, perhaps a lasting ceasefire, but I'm just not that sure about that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umz2WU67jNU&t=273.24s)]
