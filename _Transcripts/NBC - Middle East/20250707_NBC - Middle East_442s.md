# Trump ‘far too quick to declare mission accomplished’ in Iran: Dem Senator
**NBC - Middle East:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA)
*  Senator Coons, if you were the president of the United States, what is the conversation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=0.0s)]
*  you would be having with Prime Minister Netanyahu tonight? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=4.12s)]
*  I would be pressing Prime Minister Netanyahu very hard to finally come to a ceasefire, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=8.82s)]
*  to secure humanitarian aid and relief for the suffering Palestinian people of Gaza, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=16.0s)]
*  to secure the release of the remaining nearly two dozen living hostages, and to put together [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=21.98s)]
*  a framework for achieving lasting peace for the Middle East. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=28.02s)]
*  After the strikes on Iran, after President Trump showed he was willing to take great [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  risks to support Netanyahu's direction and agenda, and frankly after Hezbollah, Iran, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=38.62s)]
*  and Hamas have all been significantly weakened by military action, the president should be [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  pushing Netanyahu to finally recognize it's time for this war in Gaza, started by Hamas [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=51.9s)]
*  nearly two years ago, on October 7th to be brought to an end. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=58.64s)]
*  Senator, I'd agree with that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=63.18s)]
*  I can see President Coons making that point and stressing that point, but President Trump [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=66.0s)]
*  is not... [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=72.34s)]
*  That's the first time I've ever heard that phrase. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=73.34s)]
*  Well, you know, President Trump is not President Coons. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=75.02s)]
*  And so my question to you, sir, is this here, is this more of the tail wagging the dog? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=79.36s)]
*  You've got so many other narratives that are really kind of driving both the storylines [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=87.22s)]
*  around Gaza and what's happening there, as well as Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=93.5s)]
*  For example, you've got headlines, Israeli officials think Trump could give them a green [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=97.72s)]
*  light to attack Iran again, noting Israeli officials say Netanyahu wants to reach understandings [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=102.32s)]
*  with Trump about future U.S. nuclear negotiations with Iran and on possible scenarios that would [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  justify renewed Israeli military strikes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=114.04s)]
*  So it seems like the policy is being set by Netanyahu, as opposed to, as you've described [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=117.52s)]
*  it, the president sort of laying down what needs to happen in order for the U.S. to continue [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=125.4s)]
*  to back efforts in both Gaza and Iran. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=133.08s)]
*  Look, there is a real chance here for lasting regional peace. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=139.08s)]
*  And Netanyahu just needs to grasp that moment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=144.08s)]
*  And President Trump needs to press him to grasp that moment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=147.44s)]
*  Netanyahu, for his own personal reasons, has long placed securing the release of the hostages [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=151.48s)]
*  still held in Gaza by Hamas below a lot of other objectives. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=158.24s)]
*  But he's got the chance now to achieve what is a significant path forward, which is reconciliation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=163.8s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia, a very real end to the Arab-Israeli conflict now decades old, and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=171.72s)]
*  a lasting security and economic alignment between Israel and most of the Gulf states, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=178.72s)]
*  most of the Arab states of the region. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=185.56s)]
*  But he cannot do that without a credible path forward towards Palestinian self-governance. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=188.12s)]
*  If President Trump gives him the kinds of assurances of Israeli security and of lasting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  American support that I expect Netanyahu is seeking, then he ought to be demanding in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=200.1s)]
*  return a real path towards peace, something Netanyahu has just refused to pursue for several [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=206.02s)]
*  years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=212.32s)]
*  This is the draft proposal, and these are details sent by one of the Hamas mediators [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  to, that were obtained by the Associated Press. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=220.56s)]
*  This truce would last 60 days. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=223.64s)]
*  There would be the release of 10 living hostages, release of the remains of 18 hostages, Palestinian [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  prisoners' exchange for Israeli hostages, ramped up humanitarian aid entering Gaza, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=229.92s)]
*  Israeli forces would withdraw to a buffer zone and start negotiations to end the war. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=235.04s)]
*  I think, I just, Prime Minister Netanyahu does not believe in the security of the Palestinian [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=240.52s)]
*  people in a Palestinian state. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=246.2s)]
*  He doesn't believe in that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  And so what, and we're looking at live photos right now of the dinner that is happening [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=249.04s)]
*  between President Trump and Netanyahu. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=254.6s)]
*  We're going to ask the control room if we have audio, and if so, we will bring it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=257.16s)]
*  But we have audio, so we'll dip in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=260.56s)]
*  We're dipping in? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=264.08s)]
*  We're going to monitor, and then we'll dip in shortly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=265.68s)]
*  But Senator, I guess I have to ask you, Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition is a conservative, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  a right-wing coalition that one of their tenets is that not only they don't believe in a two-state [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  solution, so how exactly is the peace everyone is talking about going to come to fruition? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=279.8s)]
*  It is exceptionally difficult, and it is almost impossible with the current governing coalition. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=286.84s)]
*  Two members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Minister Smotrich and Minister Ben-Gavir, have said [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=293.28s)]
*  repeatedly that they will leave the government, which could cause it to collapse if he were [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=298.64s)]
*  to go ahead with anything resembling peace with the Palestinians. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=303.84s)]
*  But Yair Lapid and several opposition leaders have recently said they would join a government [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=309.02s)]
*  of national unity if that's what it takes to achieve a lasting peace in Gaza and to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=315.24s)]
*  forestall a possible annexation attempt of the West Bank. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=321.66s)]
*  This is a critical moment, and the very conservative, very right-wing coalition that supports the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu government will not make peace, a lasting peace with the Palestinians. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=332.9s)]
*  You're absolutely right about that, Simone. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=338.06s)]
*  So frankly, the United States has a chance here to help broker what could be an enduring [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=340.7s)]
*  peace, and a key part of that is negotiations with Iran. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=346.24s)]
*  President Trump was far too quick to declare mission accomplished, just like George Bush [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=351.26s)]
*  in the first months after the war in Iraq, and to declare that all of Iran's nuclear [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=357.02s)]
*  weapons program, its enrichment program, forgive me, had been obliterated. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=364.46s)]
*  We don't know that for sure yet. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=369.46s)]
*  We need to get credible, nonpartisan, nonpolitical intelligence from the ground in Iran, and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=371.42s)]
*  that requires getting inspectors back into these facilities. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=378.34s)]
*  And so I'm encouraged that there is an opening towards negotiations with Iran by a senior [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=382.46s)]
*  representative of the Trump administration. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=388.78s)]
*  But that's the path forward here, is to secure a lasting end to Iran's nuclear enrichment [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=391.46s)]
*  program and to try and deal with their ballistic missiles and their support for terrorist proxies [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=397.41999999999996s)]
*  in the region. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  If what Trump and Netanyahu are talking about is that sort of a concerted effort to negotiate [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=404.44s)]
*  a lasting end to Iran's threat to Israel's existence, that should be a significant step [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=410.08s)]
*  forward for those concerned about the stability and security of Israel and of peace in the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=416.12s)]
*  region. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOI4HuaUfEA&t=421.4s)]
