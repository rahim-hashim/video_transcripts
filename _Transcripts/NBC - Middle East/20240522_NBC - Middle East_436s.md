# Iran 'really wants to avoid confrontation with U.S.': How death of Raisi could shake up Middle East
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k)
*  Tens of thousands of people gathered in Tehran today for the funerals of Iranian President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=0.0s)]
*  Ibrahim Raisi and others, of course, the foreign minister and others killed in that helicopter [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=4.96s)]
*  crash over the weekend. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Their coffins carried through the massive crowd, members of the Revolutionary Guard [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  joined in attendance by leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban, as well as delegates [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=16.98s)]
*  from Iraq, Qatar, Afghanistan, Russia, and China. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=22.6s)]
*  I believe Pakistan also. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=26.04s)]
*  Joining me now, David Ignatius, Washington Post foreign affairs columnist extraordinaire [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  and the author of the new thriller, Phantom Orbit. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=32.28s)]
*  Another thriller, David, you are amazing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=35.96s)]
*  He writes these novels on top of, you know, the wonderful column and traveling around [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=38.44s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=43.28s)]
*  But fun for me, I hope for readers too. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=44.28s)]
*  Going to Gaza and going to places where most people, most reporters, certainly most columnists [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=45.28s)]
*  don't venture. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  A hands-on reporter. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=50.959999999999994s)]
*  So first of all, congratulations on the book. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=52.76s)]
*  I want to talk about Iran and this extraordinary transition. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=54.8s)]
*  Raisi was not that consequential a leader. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=60.32s)]
*  He was sort of an in-between leader, but he was expected to be the successor to the supreme [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=63.72s)]
*  leader who just governs foreign policy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=68.6s)]
*  But the supreme leader is known to be ailing in some ways. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=72.08s)]
*  He's in his 80s. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=75.84s)]
*  He's not going to be there forever. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=78.04s)]
*  And now there is a succession issue. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=79.88s)]
*  The foreign minister was consequential because he was quietly a hardliner, but he was quietly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=81.92s)]
*  a go-between on some of these secret talks. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=87.2s)]
*  And there was just last week talks in Oman between the U.S. and indirect talks, they [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=89.2s)]
*  say between the U.S. and Iran on so many issues. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=96.08s)]
*  So Raisi was a figure of the regime. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=100.2s)]
*  He was the enforcer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=103.28s)]
*  He was the judge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=104.98s)]
*  He was the disciplinarian. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=105.98s)]
*  I'm told that U.S. intelligence estimates were that he would not in fact replace Ali [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  Khamenei as supreme leader, that the likely successor is Khamenei's son, Moshtaba. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=114.64s)]
*  So in that sense, there may be a little bit less instability than people might think. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=120.48s)]
*  The replacement of the foreign minister is fascinating because the person who's now acting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  foreign minister is the specific individual who's been meeting with Brett McGurk, our [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  deputy national security adviser, top White House personal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=134.36s)]
*  That's what I meant, that the foreign minister's successor now is this man who's been... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  And the other thing is, as you well know, the U.S. intelligence assessment has been [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=143.56s)]
*  that Iran did not want a wider war in Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=148.4s)]
*  It said its proxies were doing this, but Hezbollah never opened a real opening in the Northern [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  Front. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  And they said that they didn't have total control over the Houthis and what they were [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  doing in the Red Sea, but that the others were pretty much under their direction, weaponized [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=161.88s)]
*  by them, of course. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=167.76s)]
*  The U.S. has had a remarkable, little understood, but meaningful dialogue with Iran since October [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=169.76s)]
*  7. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  It's been partly through the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which manages our contacts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  We don't have diplomatic relations, but sometimes it's been face to face where McGurk from the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=184.04s)]
*  White House will go out and meet with an Iranian. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=188.68s)]
*  And the messages that have been passed almost always are about reducing tensions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=191.48s)]
*  And as you say, Iran does not want a confrontation with the United States. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=197.24s)]
*  The U.S. used force and pounded Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq after they hit [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=201.64s)]
*  American forces. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=208.4s)]
*  Since then, there haven't been attacks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=209.96s)]
*  So I think the feeling is that Iran, for now, although it's still up to mischief all over [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=211.68s)]
*  the place, really wants to avoid the confrontation with the U.S., is putting some limits on its [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=217.84s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=223.6s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  This question, as you know, Andrew, the whole time we've been journalists since 1979, is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  when will the arc of the revolution in Iran crest and it become more like a normal country? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=231.24s)]
*  And you can't say you see that yet. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=236.04s)]
*  And all of this, as Jake Sullivan was in Saudi Arabia, and we're being told by Saudi and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=238.08s)]
*  U.S. sources that a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia for civilian nuclear [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  power, for a defense treaty, economic trade agreements, cutting Israel out of it if they, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  if Netanyahu still refuses to agree to a Palestinian state, a pathway is the way they're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=257.64s)]
*  facing it to a state. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  But these things, this thing is all coming together, maybe to pressure Netanyahu. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think it's now on the way to happening, whether Netanyahu joins or not. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  But this is a signal to Israel, to the prime minister. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=272.92s)]
*  This train is leaving the station. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=277.08s)]
*  One of Netanyahu's big goals for some years now has been normalization of relations with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia is saying it's there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  All you have to do is commit to a credible pathway. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=287.88s)]
*  That's the phrase that the Saudi press agency used, a credible pathway to a two-state solution, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=290.56s)]
*  not at no time frame as to when it would happen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  So Netanyahu give up this dream of normal relations across the Arab world to avoid the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=297.92s)]
*  commitment to the Palestinian state. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=304.32s)]
*  Probably if his coalition stays intact, his coalition will force him to. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=306.56s)]
*  But I think you've got exactly the right description of the U.S. approach. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  It's happening, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=315.52s)]
*  So if you're going to join, now's the time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=317.84s)]
*  And speaking of happening, your new book, so Phantom Orbit, just as U.S. Space Command [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=320.96s)]
*  saying yesterday that Russia has launched a satellite capable of inspecting and attacking [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=326.56s)]
*  other satellites, space wars, whatever, and you've got Phantom Orbit. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=330.72s)]
*  And this is not your first spinoff. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=337.12s)]
*  You're deeply sourced. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=339.2s)]
*  So you're right on the edge of what our intelligence sees as the next battle. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=341.08s)]
*  So Phantom Orbit describes the coming role of space as a domain of conflict. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=347.08s)]
*  Russia's launch yesterday is the latest in a series of moves that I described in the book. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=355.68s)]
*  The Russians have had potential attack satellites up there for some years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=362.64s)]
*  The Chinese have even more sophisticated ones. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=367.36s)]
*  They can pluck our satellites out of orbit. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=370.0s)]
*  They may be able to interfere through high powered microwaves or lasers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=372.32s)]
*  I think the point for your viewers is space, this benign, the heavens that we think of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=377.52s)]
*  is becoming increasingly a zone of conflict. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=384.32s)]
*  Russia's Chinese have got a lot up there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=387.76s)]
*  I'm sure the U.S. is now beginning to develop similar offensive and defensive weapons. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=390.48s)]
*  David Ignatius, I don't know how you do it all. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=395.76s)]
*  You're always cutting edge in your columns. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=398.32s)]
*  You're covering everything. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=400.32s)]
*  And you're writing these books that become, you know, that get picked up as movies. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=401.36s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=406.08s)]
*  I'm like you, Andrew. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=406.72s)]
*  I like finding things out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=407.84s)]
*  And I can do that in my novels as well as in my journals. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=409.04s)]
*  It's just wonderful. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=411.52s)]
*  And it's a great read. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=412.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=413.36s)]
*  Phantom Orbit is the book. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=414.64s)]
*  Get it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JLLu_g19k&t=415.76s)]
