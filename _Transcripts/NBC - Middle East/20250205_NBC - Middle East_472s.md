# 'Unrealistic and basically impossible': Lawmaker on why Trump's Gaza proposal is 'unhelpful'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, member of the House Committee on Appropriations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, it's great seeing you always. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  You as well, thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  This morning, Speaker Johnson was asked whether he supports the president's comments. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=8.56s)]
*  Here's what he had to say just a little while ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=13.56s)]
*  We're trying to get the details of it, but I think this is a good development. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=16.56s)]
*  We have to back Israel 100 percent, and so whatever form that takes, we're interested in having that discussion. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=21.56s)]
*  But it was a surprising development, but I think it's one that we'll applaud. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=27.619999999999997s)]
*  What was your reaction to all of this, Congresswoman? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=32.62s)]
*  Well, Jose, first of all, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your beloved Uncle Waldo. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=36.62s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=41.62s)]
*  It's got to be tough. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=43.62s)]
*  I mean, let's just be clear. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=44.62s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=48.68s)]
*  Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that fanatically attacked Israel, killed 1200 of her citizens, took 250 captive, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=49.68s)]
*  and we have 79 hostages that remain in Gaza still being held captive. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=61.68s)]
*  And after this first phase of ceasefire and hostage release, we have to make sure that all the hostages are able to be returned home to their families. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  And so my reaction was, what are we doing to make sure that it is more likely, not less likely, that all the hostages come home [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  and that we can start down the pathway of returning to the Abraham Accords process that was in the midst of normalizing relationships between Israel and her Arab neighbors, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=89.8s)]
*  including and especially Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=102.8s)]
*  I was in the region on October 7th, you may remember, Jose. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=104.8s)]
*  I have returned to the region and visited many of those Arab countries, including Israel, multiple times since then, and I'm going back in April on a bipartisan CODOL. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=107.8s)]
*  And I co-chair this Congress, the Abraham Accords Caucus. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=117.86s)]
*  So we have to make sure that we're not doing anything that is going to make normalization between Israel and her Arab neighbors less likely rather than more likely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=121.86s)]
*  And we don't need to do something that emboldens Hamas and allows them to recruit even more generations of terrorists to our hellbent on Israel's destruction and the destruction of the Jewish people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  And that's what this proposal would incite in terms of the reaction and the destabilizing force that pursuing this idea would have. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  This morning, White House National Security Advisor Mike Walz was asked if the president's comments meant the end of the United States support for a two-state solution. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't think, I certainly didn't hear the president say it was the end of the two-state solution. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  You have the Palestinian Authority. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=169.98s)]
*  You have the West Bank. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=171.98s)]
*  And when he was asked directly who is going to live there in the future, he said the Palestinians and perhaps many others. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=173.98s)]
*  Congressman, I just want, if you would, to expand on what you were just saying, because we're just entering right now, the world is, this second phase of the negotiations between Israel and Hamas to continue. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=182.98s)]
*  Hopefully bringing those hostages back out of Gaza. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=199.04s)]
*  What kind of effect do you think all of this talk here could play on those negotiations? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=206.04s)]
*  I think that they would place those negotiations in serious jeopardy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=216.04s)]
*  If you listen to the statements of the Crown Prince, the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, who I have had the opportunity to meet with, and who is absolutely committed to normalization with Israel, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=220.1s)]
*  they've made very clear that, I mean, it doesn't need to be an overnight transformation that a Palestinian state has achieved, but that a pathway to statehood for the Palestinians needs to be a part of the process. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=233.1s)]
*  I mean, the president's proposal is unrealistic, is basically impossible. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=247.16s)]
*  You do not have countries in the region who are willing to take the Palestinians, and we have to make sure that we work together to establish an orderly process of rebuilding Gaza so that we can ensure that Israel and Israelis are more safe, not less safe. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  We don't need to inflame another generation of terrorists hell-bent on Israel's and Jews' destruction. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=274.22s)]
*  And that's why Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley and even Trump's facial expression on Suzy Wilde, Trump's chiefs of staff, faced yesterday were appalled and said that this is a proposal that is entirely unhelpful. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=281.22s)]
*  Carzohan, meanwhile, the Trump administration, as you know, revoked temporary protected status for almost 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. recently, leaving them open essentially in the future to deportations. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  I know you represent thousands of Venezuelan Americans in your district. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Jose, the fact that the Homeland Security Secretary, Cristi Noem, Donald Trump's Homeland Security Secretary, called Venezuelans here in this country who are here because they fled Maduro's oppressive and brutal regime dirtbags, I mean, the insult is breathtaking. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=318.34s)]
*  Beyond that, they have not prioritized, as they said they would, people who are criminals and dangerous to leave in the United States. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=339.4s)]
*  What they're doing is they're going after people who were lawfully here, who followed a lawful process like TPS, like the humanitarian parole system. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=349.4s)]
*  And he's revoked that, reneged on the promise that we made to these Venezuelans who have fled a regime where, I mean, if the memo that Cristi Noem released saying that there's been improvements in the economy and health and the criminal justice system there are true, then why are over half of Venezuelans living in poverty and famine? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=358.46s)]
*  Maduro himself is a narco terrorist who is under indictment and, I mean, the health care system, I've been to the border of Venezuela and Colombia. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=384.52s)]
*  I can tell you the health care system and people's health is decimated there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=394.52s)]
*  The conditions are not ripe or even improved to return and deport 600,000 Venezuelans back to Venezuela to certain oppression and likely violence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=400.52s)]
*  Unacceptable. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=412.52s)]
*  Well, the only point that I guess, Congresswoman, that the Venezuelan government would say is that, well, there have been improvements in health and the economy for members of the regime. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=413.58s)]
*  That is, I think, undisputable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=425.58s)]
*  And that smiley handshake from Trump's envoy with Maduro himself and the allowing of oil licenses to be extended very quietly, that puts billions more into Maduro's hands and enriches the regime and makes it more likely that a dictator who took power for a third term is going to stay in power. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=429.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E-Yo9QqO8k&t=459.58s)]
