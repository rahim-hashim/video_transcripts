# Ex-PM says Israel 'not just standing on the sidelines', launched ground incursion in Syria
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20)
*  Joining us now, former Israeli prime minister and former chief of staff for Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=0.0s)]
*  Naftali Bennett. Really good to have you and thank you for joining us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=5.04s)]
*  I want to get your take on what's next for the region after we're seeing what's unfolding in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=8.88s)]
*  Syria and what you think it might mean for Iran. Well, certainly there's good news and there's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=14.64s)]
*  uncertainty as well. The good news is that Iran and its proxies and the whole access has been [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  severely weakened. And, you know, Yaya Senoar attacked Israel a year and two months ago, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=29.2s)]
*  hoping to destroy Israel. In the meantime, Hamas has been all but demolished, Hezbollah, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=37.28s)]
*  its leadership has been taken out, Syria is out, and I would say Iran is certainly on the defensive. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=44.24s)]
*  And this is good news. However, the new replacement is an unknown. We're talking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=52.48s)]
*  about a very radical individual, Jolani, you know, who grew up in Al-Qaeda. And the fact that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  there's some facade of being a bit more moderate, well, I think it's way too early to say that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=67.2s)]
*  So we've got to be very cautious. And that's why Israel is not just standing on the sidelines, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=73.84s)]
*  but it's acting. We created a buffer zone and we've taken out much of Syrians' lethal weapons [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=78.72s)]
*  so that the damage they can cause others will be minimized. I know that you've taken out the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=86.96s)]
*  Navy as well. You're talking about the buffer zone that Israel is now enforcing. Has the country [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=93.68s)]
*  reached out to Al Jolani or the interim prime minister in Syria to try to figure out which [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=100.64s)]
*  path that country is going to take and whether the path might not be so hostile toward Israel? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=108.08s)]
*  Well, it's way too early because I'm hearing the words. The words are moderate and he's talking [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=114.88s)]
*  about building institutions. But has Israel reached out? Have there been conversations? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=120.08s)]
*  At this point, the main thing was to deny this new regime of lethal and weapons of mass destruction, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  such as chemical weapons. We need to make sure that regardless of whether they turn out to be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=134.0s)]
*  positive or negative, they do not hold these weapons. Later on, if we see over time that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=140.48s)]
*  the new regime's actions are positive, then gradually we'll be able to review our policy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=148.32s)]
*  What does Israel do now with Iran specifically? We talked about that a little bit up top, but [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=156.32s)]
*  with the two options that Iran seems to have in front of it, either double down on its nuclear [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=163.84s)]
*  program or try to find a way to stabilize relations with its neighbors, where does Israel see its role [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=167.84s)]
*  here? What will Israel do? What might they do in the face of these potentials? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=173.92s)]
*  I could say what I would do as a prime minister of Israel. What I would do at this point, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=182.64s)]
*  there's a high risk that Iran will try and break out for a nuclear weapon. They have enough highly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=187.28s)]
*  enriched uranium for 12 nuclear bombs. What I would do, I would strike Iran's nuclear and regime [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=193.2s)]
*  capabilities with two goals, diminishing their nuclear program as much as we can. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=203.04s)]
*  I'm not talking about a one-off. I'm talking about a sustained attack. I think the goal of the West [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=209.76s)]
*  should be ultimately to topple the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It's a horrible regime [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=216.8s)]
*  that's been oppressing its own people, that's been exporting terror, rockets, and death [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=223.84s)]
*  to the entire region. I think the world will be way better if this head of the octopus of terror [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  will be severed. There's some domestic politics. If you are running for prime minister, if you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  decide to go up against Benjamin Netanyahu, or if Benjamin Netanyahu decides to step aside regardless, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=244.8s)]
*  you're going to get asked about Netanyahu's trial. He took the stand today and said that all of this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=250.24s)]
*  was baloney. He used different words and that he's focused on the country and the war, not himself. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=256.0s)]
*  What's your take on the corruption charges and this trial that has hung over Israel's head [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  for so long and deeply divided the nation? Well, as an Israeli citizen, regardless of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  political opposition that I may present, as an Israeli citizen, I would hope that our prime minister [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=276.23999999999995s)]
*  will ultimately come out clean from this trial. But we'll let the trial do its course and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=285.44s)]
*  we'll respect whatever results there are. Naftali Bennett, thank you so much for coming on [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=292.32s)]
*  and talking about the future for the country and the ways in which [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=297.12s)]
*  you would address Iran specifically if you were in charge. I appreciate it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQxST30l20&t=300.8s)]
