# 'No options left' for Iran: 4-star general says country's economy, military is 'devastated'
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg)
*  Garrett, with all the back and forth, where do things stand right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=0.0s)]
*  It has been a busy 24 hours, Ana, starting with Iran's counterattack at U.S. assets [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=4.16s)]
*  in the Middle East, which seems to have been mostly for show at a Qatari air base. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=10.24s)]
*  That kicked off discussions involving the president, the emir of Qatar, and the Iranians, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=15.48s)]
*  while the president was also working with Israelis to try to see if they could forge [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=19.48s)]
*  this truce. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=23.6s)]
*  The vice president got involved, and ultimately you had the announcement on Truth Social last [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=24.6s)]
*  night that there would be a ceasefire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=28.36s)]
*  There were some missiles exchanged on both sides in the hours between the announcement [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=30.8s)]
*  and the ceasefire going into effect that led to the president coming out on the South [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=35.36s)]
*  Lawn with that sort of colorful policing of this new ceasefire, ultimately calling [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=39.64s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, asking to turn around Israeli planes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  They were going for a counterstrike against Iran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=48.6s)]
*  The president on board Air Force One is focused now turning here to the Netherlands in this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  NATO summit, where he's also shared images of a text he received from the NATO secretary [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=56.08s)]
*  general saying he'll receive another welcome win when he gets here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  That's all member countries agreeing to up their defense spending to 5 percent of GDP. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=66.88s)]
*  President has long complained about European countries in particular not paying enough [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=72.36s)]
*  for their own defense. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=76.28s)]
*  So a win here in Europe where the president's not used to a particularly warm reception [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  after what has been a very busy week, busy 24 hours of diplomacy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=83.68s)]
*  Keir, I just spoke moments ago with the former ambassador to the U.S. from Israel who signaled [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=87.4s)]
*  that he didn't believe Israel had violated this ceasefire, saying any strikes came before [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=94.24s)]
*  the ceasefire was to go into effect. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=99.52s)]
*  Are allies certain that the ceasefire will now hold? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=102.08s)]
*  Well, that's a big question. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=106.64s)]
*  So the accusation from the Israelis in a statement from Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=113.04s)]
*  office, which ultimately accepted that Israel wouldn't retaliate, is that the Iranians [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  fired a missile precisely six minutes after the ceasefire went into effect and then two [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=128.12s)]
*  more missiles just around two and a half hours after the ceasefire went into effect, that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=132.68s)]
*  those missiles didn't do any damage, that they were stopped. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  So I think what the Israelis have really been angry about overnight is that attack on Beersheba [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  where a number of Israelis died in a residential area and that they were furious and upset [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=147.6s)]
*  by that, understandably, and that the violations of the ceasefire by those few missiles, according [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=155.2s)]
*  to the Israelis, the Iranians deny it by the way, that was their reason for responding. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=161.88s)]
*  The reality is with the ceasefire is that you do get, you know, kind of moments like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=174.04s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily all happen all at once in one moment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=175.04s)]
*  And President Trump's intervention appears to have fixed it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=179.6s)]
*  But you know, Anna, what's amazing is, of course, that with that expletive response [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  from President Trump, you know, once again, what happened a few hours ago seems like a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=188.2s)]
*  lifetime ago. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, just a couple of things just to point out, you know, the Iranians fired missiles [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=194.4s)]
*  on Qatar and then shortly afterwards, President Trump announced that there was a ceasefire [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  and we were told that the Qataris were involved in negotiating that ceasefire. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  And then also, of course, that the Qataris had been given advanced warning of the strikes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  and so had the US. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=214.12s)]
*  Another thing that is getting less attention but is important is this question of where [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=216.12s)]
*  is the highly enriched uranium that Iran has, the 60% enriched uranium? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=220.84s)]
*  Has their nuclear program really been, as President Trump has said, obliterated or even [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=228.72s)]
*  set back enormously? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=235.12s)]
*  Clearly, massive damage has been done. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=236.52s)]
*  But those are big questions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=239.12s)]
*  And I say that because in the end, the ceasefire is a ceasefire. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=240.12s)]
*  But what comes next in negotiations over those kind of issues, and it's not going to be easy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=243.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=246.72s)]
*  As you point out, it's such a layered situation right now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=247.72s)]
*  Joel, as the president gears up for this NATO summit, how do you think he'll be greeted there? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Anna, I think that the NATO allies are going to look at him and say this is an inherently [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  unstable situation and now is the time to really supercharge our diplomacy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=262.64s)]
*  So congratulations on getting that ceasefire, on working with the Israelis, on working, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  of course, with the Qataris regarding Iran. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=272.12s)]
*  But we need a bigger process. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=275.12s)]
*  We need to be in the game as Europe. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=276.48s)]
*  We were in the game on Iran diplomacy for a number of years. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=278.76s)]
*  This is how you solidify and lock in those gains that were just made and where Israel [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=281.24s)]
*  feels like it did obtain some defensive benefits as well. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=286.16s)]
*  And I think that's the key thing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=291.56s)]
*  Will the president leverage this moment or will he sort of let it pass and then we continue [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=293.24s)]
*  to stay in an unstable situation? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=298.2s)]
*  General, let's not forget what happened literally just hours before this ceasefire. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=300.04s)]
*  Iran launching a retaliatory attack against the U.S., aiming missiles at a U.S. base in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=305.76s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=312.68s)]
*  What do you think Iran was hoping to accomplish with that response? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=313.68s)]
*  I think this was entirely on Iran's part, an attempt to persuade their own population [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=318.92s)]
*  that they weren't deeply humiliated, they weren't subject to Israeli dominance of their [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=323.68s)]
*  airspace. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=330.08s)]
*  Look, Iran is in a really desperate situation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=331.56s)]
*  The economy's in the tubes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=335.64s)]
*  They had no good military operations options left. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=338.08s)]
*  They couldn't close the Gulf of Persian Gulf to oil or they would have alienated China [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=341.8s)]
*  and the Asian rim. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=347.52s)]
*  They have no allies. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=350.28s)]
*  They've suffered devastating losses of their military, scientific and political leadership. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=352.2s)]
*  There must have been some really hard conversations. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=358.88s)]
*  They had to come to the table. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=361.44s)]
*  They had no options left. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=363.4s)]
*  The Israelis probably would have liked the war to have gone on another week or two to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=365.48s)]
*  go after regime targets. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=370.88s)]
*  But essentially, they had accomplished all their objectives and they were running out [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=373.48s)]
*  of smart munitions. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=377.4s)]
*  That Arrow 3 missile is $4 million an interception. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=379.36s)]
*  It was an appropriate time to end the war. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=385.84s)]
*  I think the peace will be fragile. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=387.68s)]
*  The real question is, how do you get them back to the table? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=391.96s)]
*  How do you get them after 30 years of pursuing nuclear weapons, which has suffered a devastating [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=394.48s)]
*  impact on that U.S. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=401.28s)]
*  strike, how do you get them to give up that objective? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=402.64s)]
*  By the way, we ought to assume they did move their 60% enriched uranium. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=406.24s)]
*  It's in somebody's condo in Tehran right now, and it'll be there as a factor in the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  future negotiations. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  You can't stop the nuclear program until they sign a treaty and we get international [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=419.8s)]
*  inspectors back on the ground in Iran. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=425.96s)]
*  I mean, I found it very fascinating to learn that that enriched uranium can be just held [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=428.64s)]
*  in canisters, stuff they could move in the back of a truck or in the trunk of a car because [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=433.32s)]
*  of how portable it is and how they store it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=439.08s)]
*  General, can we be sure that Iran, the country that has chanted death to America, won't try [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=442.0s)]
*  further retaliation against the U.S.? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  For example, do we still need to worry about Iranian cyber attacks or those reported sleeper [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=449.56s)]
*  cells? Do they just go back to sleep? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, look, the Iranians are courageous, creative people. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=458.52s)]
*  They've got a deep scientific bench. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  The Quds Force is still intact, capable of enormous harm. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=463.84s)]
*  They've got a very healthy cyber worker capability. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=468.44s)]
*  So we should deal with them in a very wary manner. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=473.88s)]
*  But look, again, they're on their knees. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=476.48s)]
*  They have been knocked apart. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=478.68s)]
*  Their own people despise them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=481.08s)]
*  Half the population are women, are in an oppressive regime. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=483.12s)]
*  So half the population of Iran are Persians or other ethnic minorities who hate the Ayatollah [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=488.32s)]
*  and his government. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=497.0s)]
*  I think in the longer run, it's going to be very difficult to get them to negotiate in good [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=499.0s)]
*  faith. For 46 years, they said the primary national objective of Iran was the elimination of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=504.76000000000005s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=511.44s)]
*  You've got to get them to walk away from that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=512.88s)]
*  So this is looks to me like a year or more of diplomacy ahead of us. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=514.72s)]
*  And hopefully it will lower the tension. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=518.72s)]
*  But President Trump's strike on the three nuclear sites was a bold, brilliant move and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=521.76s)]
*  contributed to this situation. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=529.6s)]
*  Joel, you also worked in the Bush administration during the Iraq invasion that led to regime [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=532.52s)]
*  change. Do you see it happening in Iran? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=538.6s)]
*  Because President Trump says that's not what he wants. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=540.96s)]
*  Well, you know, there are a lot of lessons learned about the Iraq experience and one, the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=544.96s)]
*  primary one is that a regime change is a horrible policy goal for the United States. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=550.8s)]
*  It never ends up as predicted. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=556.64s)]
*  We don't control the internal political dynamics of other countries. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=558.8s)]
*  And so one should not really engage in that kind of thinking. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  But I think that the challenge now is that this regime in Tehran is so dangerous and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  cornered in many ways. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=574.5999999999999s)]
*  And while now it has been brought to its knees, as General McCaffrey says, it had enough, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=576.4s)]
*  clearly. My instinct is that we're going to likely see a more shadowy war now underway to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=581.84s)]
*  try to destabilize that regime, not necessarily to send in troops and certainly not by us, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=589.96s)]
*  but perhaps by Israel and others and to try to erode it from underneath to see if something [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=595.32s)]
*  can happen inside Iran. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=601.76s)]
*  But, you know, the Iranian military, the IRGC, the the Basij, other security forces [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=602.92s)]
*  controlled by the Iranian government, they are still there, still in place, and they have [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=608.36s)]
*  control. There are no other significant military counters to that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=612.2s)]
*  So this is part of the shadow war that may take place, but it's a very dangerous and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=616.88s)]
*  difficult and I think unwise policy to pursue. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=621.36s)]
*  And Kier, we just learned in the past 24 hours that President Trump apparently made a [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=624.76s)]
*  last ditch effort at diplomacy even before Saturday's strikes. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=628.8s)]
*  There were apparently contacts with Iranian officials, but that Iran's supreme leader [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=632.8s)]
*  could not be reached. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=637.72s)]
*  Do his generals know where he is? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=639.28s)]
*  Is there a clear chain of command and communication or are there cracks in the regime? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=641.04s)]
*  Oh, you don't need to have any intelligence or insight into Iran to kind of realize that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=649.24s)]
*  the regime in Iran is shaking right now. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=657.72s)]
*  I mean, that would be inevitable for any government facing the kind of barrage that it's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  faced. I will say one thing, Anna, and it's an interesting point. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=665.0s)]
*  Iran is on the cusp of regime change because Ayatollah Khamenei is in his 80s. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=669.12s)]
*  Now, OK, perhaps he's going to live many, many more years. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=675.0s)]
*  And, you know, no matter what people think of him, I guess you could say, you know, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=678.04s)]
*  good health to him. But even Iran itself is preparing for that shift. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=683.4s)]
*  And a really interesting question is what does all of that that's happened in the past [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=689.84s)]
*  12 days? What impact does that have on that change? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=695.6400000000001s)]
*  There are extremists and people who are more liberal in Iran who gains power when that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=700.0400000000001s)]
*  comes about, because that could be as much as important to what the future holds as what [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  has happened in the past few days. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf3auhPqKUg&t=714.1600000000001s)]
