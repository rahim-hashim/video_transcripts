# Gaza reports 19 people killed in airstrike during ceasefire delay
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0)
*  Yeah, good morning to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a moment so many thought would just never come, but here we are. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=1.92s)]
*  And the ceasefire is in effect now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=6.32s)]
*  But as you mentioned, it was supposed to happen earlier this morning at 8.30 local time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=9.0s)]
*  It did not, because Israeli authorities say that they were not given by Hamas the name [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  of the three hostages to be released today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=20.04s)]
*  And as part of the agreement, as part of the terms, they're meant to be given those names [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=22.36s)]
*  24 hours before the release of the hostages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=26.16s)]
*  Hamas replied that they were, quote, technical field operations issues, whether that means [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=30.16s)]
*  that they had issues relaying and communicating the names of the hostages, we don't know. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=36.2s)]
*  But what we do know, that three hours went by and the ceasefire was in effect. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  But during those three hours, according to the civil defense, three, at least 19 people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  were killed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=51.44s)]
*  And that just goes to show how every hour, every day matters and counts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=52.96s)]
*  I mean, they survived 470 days only to be killed in the last three hours before the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=58.68s)]
*  ceasefire goes into effect. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=64.24s)]
*  Here's what we know about the hostages to be released. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=66.32s)]
*  They are Romy Gonen, 24 years old. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=68.76s)]
*  She was abducted from the Nova Music Festival. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=71.92s)]
*  Doron Steinbracher, 31 years old. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=75.12s)]
*  She was abducted from her kibbutz, Azar. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=77.76s)]
*  And Emily Damani, a British citizen, 28 years old, kidnapped from that same kibbutz, along [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=81.64s)]
*  with some friends. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  Now, in return, Israel will release about 90 prisoners, Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  We don't yet have a list of who they are, women, children, men. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=96.32s)]
*  We don't yet know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=99.32s)]
*  But what I can tell you is that over the course of these six weeks, the first stage of this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=100.32s)]
*  deal, hundreds will be released. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Among them, some described by Israeli authorities as having blood on their hands. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Others have been held in what's called administrative detention. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=112.88s)]
*  They've not been charged, they've not been tried, and they've been held indefinitely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=116.36s)]
*  If you ask any Palestinian, they will see these people as being hostages, really, of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli prison system. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=126.16s)]
*  And Palestinian leaders say that Israel has been arresting as many as they can, so they [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=128.04s)]
*  have sort of bargaining chips, as many as they can for this deal. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=132.48s)]
*  How the rest of the day will unfold, it's all very fluid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=138.04s)]
*  It's changing by the hour. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=141.2s)]
*  But as we understand it, it is still on track for a release not before 4 p.m. local time [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=142.52s)]
*  here, 9 a.m. Eastern. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y4M8v2LtW0&t=149.04s)]
