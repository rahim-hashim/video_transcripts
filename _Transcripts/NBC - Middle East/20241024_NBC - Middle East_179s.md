# 'Absolute sea of desperate people' lining up to get food in Gaza: Raf Sanchez
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow)
*  OK, the US and Israel are sending delegations to Doha in the coming days in an effort to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=0.0s)]
*  restart a potential ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  The talks come as Egypt meets today with representatives of Hamas after its former leader, Yoha Sinwar, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=9.72s)]
*  was killed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Before leaving Qatar for London, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new $135 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=16.2s)]
*  million humanitarian aid effort to feed desperate Palestinians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=22.48s)]
*  But we all know that it's not enough to provide funding. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=29.92s)]
*  It's not even enough to get the assistance to the borders of Gaza. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=33.6s)]
*  What's so critical is that the aid gets to the people who need it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=36.84s)]
*  And we see international correspondent Raph Sanchez joins me now from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=42.44s)]
*  So this money, this effort, this push from Secretary Blinken, why is he so concerned [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=46.28s)]
*  about what's happening in Gaza right now? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=52.6s)]
*  And what does he want the Israelis to do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Katie, when you see the images coming out of Gaza, you can understand the urgency [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=59.28s)]
*  that Secretary Blinken is referring to. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Our crew was down in the southern city of Hanyounas, and they saw just an absolute sea [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=66.84s)]
*  of desperate people lining up in front of one of the few bakeries there, hoping to get [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=74.12s)]
*  bread. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=78.84s)]
*  There was nowhere near enough bread for everybody who was lined up there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=79.84s)]
*  You're seeing it on your screen there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  That is that just surging crowd of desperate people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=84.9s)]
*  That man trying to in some ways control the crowd, trying to get bread to people who [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=88.68s)]
*  need it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=93.72000000000001s)]
*  But you can see their kids up on the shoulders of their parents there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=94.72000000000001s)]
*  It is just a dire situation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=98.68s)]
*  And Katie, that is in southern Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  That is in Hanyounas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=103.06s)]
*  The situation is so much worse up in the north of the Strip, where Israeli forces are besieging [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=104.06s)]
*  the refugee camp of Jabalia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  Very, very little food, very little medicine has been able to get in there since October [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  first when that siege began. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=117.96s)]
*  And a UN-backed monitoring group is saying pretty much the entire population of Gaza [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=120.32s)]
*  at this point, be they in the north, in the south, in the center, are facing crisis levels [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=126.24s)]
*  of hunger. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=131.04s)]
*  So you are seeing Secretary Blinken raising this issue with Israeli officials during his [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=132.23999999999998s)]
*  meetings here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=137.42s)]
*  He has said there has been some improvement since he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=138.74s)]
*  sent a letter to the Israeli government basically warning that if they don't get more aid into [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=143.4s)]
*  Gaza within the next 30 days, the U.S. may cut off military aid. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  But you can just see, Katie, by the scale of that crowd, a little bit better is clearly [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=152.6s)]
*  not good enough. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0F0XDVdow&t=157.72s)]
