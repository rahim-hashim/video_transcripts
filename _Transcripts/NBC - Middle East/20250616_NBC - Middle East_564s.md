# Why Iran's capability to break through Israel's Iron Dome is 'surprising'
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI)
*  Joining us now is Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling, retired commander of U.S. Army Europe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=0.0s)]
*  Also with us, nuclear policy and national security expert Joe Sorencioni. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=5.66s)]
*  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former advisor to the State Department. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=10.4s)]
*  Good to have you both here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=15.44s)]
*  General Hurtling, what do you make of Iran's response so far and their ability to get through [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=16.64s)]
*  the Iron Dome in some places? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=21.2s)]
*  Well, truthfully, Ana, it's been fascinating to me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=22.96s)]
*  I did not think Iran would have this kind of capability after the initial strike and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=26.4s)]
*  the fact that Israel has destroyed most of their Iranian air defense systems, as well [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  as their air force, as well as decapitating most of their military leadership. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=37.76s)]
*  So you're talking about more of a response than what I would have expected. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And truthfully, the amount and waves of missiles that Iran is throwing at Israel, specifically [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=48.08s)]
*  Tel Aviv, have the capacity to break through. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=55.04s)]
*  And here's what I mean by that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=58.04s)]
*  The Iron Dome, David's sling, all the air defense systems that Israel have are very [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=59.52s)]
*  capable. And when you talk about their capability, it's usually somewhere between 90 to 98 percent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=65.24s)]
*  strikes and hit and defensive capability against any incoming ballistic missile. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=71.44s)]
*  The problem is when you have waves of hundreds of missiles coming in, some of them will break [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=76.72s)]
*  through. And that's what we're seeing happening. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=81.92s)]
*  If Iran actually synchronizes their attack, much like they tried to do last April, 2024, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=84.04s)]
*  they would be able to get quite a few missiles through into the population centers of Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=91.84s)]
*  And that could be devastating. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=97.16s)]
*  So I'm watching this very closely, surprised that Iran's capability, even though Israel [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=98.8s)]
*  seems to have gained the upper hand, Iran is fighting back with what they have to fight [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=104.64s)]
*  back with. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  And, Joe, let's talk about the heart of the matter here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=111.2s)]
*  Why Israel says it is going after Iran in this way. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Shortly before Israel launched the strikes, the International Atomic Energy Agency said [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=118.88s)]
*  Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation obligations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  It was the first time they had made that assessment in about 20 years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=127.68s)]
*  Iran now has said it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, but has the right to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=131.76s)]
*  use nuclear energy and research. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=136.76s)]
*  Given what you know, what is Iran's nuclear capabilities at this point and how much damage [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=139.0s)]
*  has Israel inflicted? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=144.44s)]
*  Well, Iran has the capability to produce enough uranium for the core of about 10 nuclear [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=146.6s)]
*  bombs in a matter of weeks, maybe as few as 10 days. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  It would then have to construct these nuclear devices, which will take months. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=157.0s)]
*  The official U.S. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  intelligence estimate is at least a year, although that could be sped up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  That what Israel had tried to do initially is hit some of those nuclear facilities. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=166.52s)]
*  And you saw damage to the above ground, the soft parts of those agreements, electrical [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=170.88s)]
*  substations, any facilities that are above ground. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=175.76s)]
*  But it's unable on its own to get at the deeply buried centrifuges. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=178.48s)]
*  So you run the risk that Iran could decide to just throw caution to the wind and do an [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=182.44s)]
*  all out sprint to a bomb. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  That is what many of us have warned about for years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=190.12s)]
*  You attack Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=193.04s)]
*  You're not going to be able to knock out the nuclear facilities. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=194.08s)]
*  And you may just encourage Iran to then go all out for a bomb and you won't be able to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=196.84s)]
*  stop them. That explains why Netanyahu has broadened the target set. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=200.68s)]
*  You can see in recent days, it's civilian structures, political infrastructure, economic [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  infrastructure. That indicates a regime change strategy, not something to stop the nuclear [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=210.4s)]
*  program, but something to overthrow the regime. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=215.68s)]
*  I think that is beyond Israel's capability. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=218.28s)]
*  And that's what risks having this war go on for weeks and the risk of spreading to a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=220.88s)]
*  regional conflict. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=225.16s)]
*  I do want to ask more about the regime change angle in just a second. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  But just sticking with your expertise when it comes to the nuclear capabilities of Iran [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=229.76s)]
*  and these facilities that have already taken multiple hits, Israel officials are saying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=235.36s)]
*  they're not going to stop until Iran's nuclear program is dismantled, whether that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=239.88s)]
*  happens diplomatically with some kind of agreement or militarily. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=245.4s)]
*  If these sites keep taking on these types of strikes, what is the risk when it comes to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=250.44s)]
*  the dangers of of what's inside these facilities now being exposed to the general [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=256.56s)]
*  population? Well, the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, just issued a report [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=262.56s)]
*  this morning assessing the damage. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=268.08s)]
*  And they talked about the above ground facilities being damaged. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=269.88s)]
*  And the risk is not really a radioactive risk. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=273.04s)]
*  The uranium hexafluoride, the uranium gas that spins in the centrifuges is slightly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=276.32s)]
*  radioactive, but you have to ingest it basically to be hurt by it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=281.88s)]
*  It's more of a chemical risk. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=285.68s)]
*  Think of it as a highly corrosive chemical that could risk. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  And the IAEA confirms this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=290.56s)]
*  So you don't have that kind of risk. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=293.04s)]
*  You would have it a risk if Israel was to hit the reactor at Bashir. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=294.68s)]
*  That would be a reactive breach, would be highly radioactive, or if Iran were to hit [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=300.48s)]
*  the Demona research reactor in Israel. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Again, that would be a massive release of radioactive gases and other and perhaps fluids [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=307.92s)]
*  that would cause a risk. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=314.64s)]
*  But no, we're not worried about a nuclear explosion. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=315.8s)]
*  We're not worried about a Chernobyl or Fukushima type disaster at this point. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=318.32s)]
*  So, General, we we learned President Trump rejected a plan from Israel to try to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=323.24s)]
*  assassinate Iran's supreme leader. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=327.76s)]
*  This is according to two U.S. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  officials. So when we talk about this aspect of potential regime change, what are the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=330.96s)]
*  calculations behind a decision like that? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=335.92s)]
*  Well, it gets to what Joe just said, Ana. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, it has to do with what is Israel's strategy? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  Is it to conduct regime change, which requires a different approach? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=343.68s)]
*  Or does it consist of primarily eliminating their nuclear capability? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=347.48s)]
*  If you say it's their nuclear capability, that's the end state. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=352.68s)]
*  Israel by themselves does not have the ends. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=356.92s)]
*  That's the end state, but they don't have the ways and means to do this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  Those end ways and means are all part of strategy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  The same thing is true of regime change. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  What we've seen in other nations, in fact, the U.S. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=368.32s)]
*  has been involved in attempted regime change. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=371.28s)]
*  You'll see that that causes a lot of chaos within a nation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=373.52s)]
*  And I haven't heard anyone say this yet, but Iran is a country about four times the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=376.96s)]
*  size of Iraq and it has 89 million people, about half of them being women, obviously. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=382.68s)]
*  So when you're talking about the dynamics between the extreme right, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=389.12s)]
*  the people who are running the extremist part of the government versus the moderates, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=394.36s)]
*  it would be very difficult to come to a conclusion 50-50 on who takes over. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=400.44s)]
*  So when you talk about regime change or the deal that happens afterwards and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=405.44s)]
*  bringing peace, who's bringing that peace about? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=410.48s)]
*  Is it the extremists or is it the moderates? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  And are you going after nuclear weapons or are you trying to change the government? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=415.8s)]
*  That's when these kind of conflicts get very confusing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think Israel has considered all those things when they've seen an [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=422.6s)]
*  opportunity to go in and attack Iran because it has been weakened by the last two [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=426.48s)]
*  years of fighting. General, the White House is warning Iran to avoid retaliation [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=431.48s)]
*  against American forces specifically. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=437.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has been sort of walking this fine line in terms of U.S. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  involvement. We're now learning that prior to Israel's strikes, the Joint Chiefs [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=442.8s)]
*  Chairman briefed the president and his national security team on three potential [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=447.92s)]
*  options. Those options, according to three sources, included logistical support like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=452.76000000000005s)]
*  refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence, using the American military's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  electronic warfare capabilities to try to help Israel jam enemy weapons and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=468.04s)]
*  even having U.S. jets drop munitions and active combat alongside Israeli fighters, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=474.0s)]
*  for example. And yet another option, Cain briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  General, now that these attacks are ongoing, what do you see as the U.S. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  role? Well, if these bullet points are in fact correct, what I would suggest is two [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=489.76s)]
*  of them are defensive in action to try and help an ally, which is what we did the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=497.36s)]
*  last time Israel was attacked by multiple rounds of missiles coming into their [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  territory. Two of them are offensive in nature. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avyg-JWqcdI&t=505.24s)]
