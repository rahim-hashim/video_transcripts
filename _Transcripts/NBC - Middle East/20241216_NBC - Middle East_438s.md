# Inside Syria's secret drug labs
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U)
*  Let's move to the far-all Assad in Syria exposing the luxury lifestyle of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=0.0s)]
*  country's former dictator and the brutal torture system set up in his prisons. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=6.58s)]
*  We're getting a look inside now at a Syrian drug lab that produced an [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=11.28s)]
*  amphetamine-like stimulant that helped fuel the Assad regime. Let's bring in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=16.68s)]
*  NBC News international correspondent Matt Bradley who joins us live from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=22.76s)]
*  Damascus. Matt, you went inside the lab. What did you find? Yeah, Miko, it's just [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=26.76s)]
*  another signal of one of the pillars of this regime having fallen, you know, in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=33.96s)]
*  these 14-year-long civil war there was no foreign currency that the regime could [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=37.84s)]
*  use order to prop itself up. Obviously business went bust throughout the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=42.68s)]
*  country. They didn't have any cash and they needed drugs to give to their [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=46.38s)]
*  soldiers. So this was not only fueling the fight financially but also [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  psychologically. It was a really sinister movement. It flooded the entire [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  region with its multiple wars with drugs. Here's our report. Throughout Syria, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=58.84s)]
*  celebrations for the fall of Assad and the pillars that once propped up his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=65.36s)]
*  regime, like this factory on the outskirts of Damascus. It wasn't so long [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=69.04s)]
*  ago that this place was making potato chips and then the old regime took it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=73.36s)]
*  over and turned it into a factory for narcotics. As Syria's economy collapsed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=77.68s)]
*  during its nearly 14-year-long civil war, the Assad regime relied on drugs as [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=83.56s)]
*  a source of foreign currency. This is Captagon. It's basically like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=88.28s)]
*  methamphetamine. It would be just as much at home at a nightclub as on a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=92.92s)]
*  battlefield. Ahmed, a rebel field commander, told me this industry [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=96.92s)]
*  destroyed a whole generation just so Assad can earn as much money as possible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=100.92s)]
*  Whoa. All right, so he's saying all of this is ready for export. This is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=105.28s)]
*  Captagon. It's hidden inside this, you know, fake box to basically transport [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=115.48s)]
*  what looks like wires. But it's all drugs, fueling the Assad regime's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=120.92s)]
*  narco state. During our visit, the original factory owner turned up. Like [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=126.48s)]
*  many Syrians, he's just returned from exile abroad. So he says that now that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=130.64s)]
*  he's back, he's planning on developing the factory again and turning it into [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=134.6s)]
*  what it did before, which was making chips and chocolates and snacks. Hope [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=138.28s)]
*  for renewal like so much else in this new Syria. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=142.6s)]
*  And guys, here's the thing that factory owner we just spoke with, you know, he's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=147.0s)]
*  gonna have to rebuild everything. Everything he has is gone, and we're [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=150.64s)]
*  seeing that all over this country. But everybody is still smiling. And that's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=155.04s)]
*  what's actually so remarkable about being here for the past week is that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=159.32s)]
*  everybody here is ecstatic about this new regime and this new Syria, despite [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=162.04s)]
*  the fact that there's just signs of ruin and destruction everywhere we look. It's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=166.48s)]
*  remarkable. All right, and he sees Matt Bradley reporting live from Damascus. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. So Edmore Stavidis, uh, so many different reports this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=175.72s)]
*  weekend about what's going on in Syria. I'd love for you to give us your [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=180.0s)]
*  insights. There seems to be a balance hope in the streets and yet warnings [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=183.92s)]
*  from the survivors of the Arab Spring and the blow back after that a decade [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=188.76s)]
*  or so ago, saying this is going to end badly. Where are you? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=194.16s)]
*  I hear echoes of my own past here, which is as NATO commander, I led the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=199.16s)]
*  intervention in Libya. And when Moammar Gaddafi was finally taken down by his [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=204.72s)]
*  people, there was jubilation. There were smiles for weeks for a few months. Now [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=209.88s)]
*  Libya remains a very riven, roiled place kind of pulled apart. So put me down in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=215.32s)]
*  the skeptical but hopeful category. I think what we ought to do in the United [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=222.36s)]
*  States is look at what are our interests there. Number one, let's get rid of these [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=227.6s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction, notably chemical that Bashar al-Estaad has [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=234.2s)]
*  still kicking around in that country. Number two, preventing the rise of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=239.44s)]
*  another Islamic state. This is pretty fertile ground. Nature abhors a vacuum. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=244.16s)]
*  Geopolitics really abhors a vacuum. There are still remnants of the Islamic [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=250.76s)]
*  state. And then third and finally our allies in the region. We've got both [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=256.48s)]
*  Israel with the border and Turkey, NATO ally. That's a NATO border on the north [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=262.06s)]
*  up there. Those are our interests. So what we ought to do, and I think we're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=268.04s)]
*  doing it pretty well right now, is get the international community engaged. So [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=272.84s)]
*  international, get our inner agency working together. You can't solve this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  one with just the Department of Defense. You need state and Treasury and all of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=282.84s)]
*  that. And then third and finally, Joe, you need public private cooperation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=289.55999999999995s)]
*  I was really struck. Okay, now we're not going to make amphetamines, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=294.84s)]
*  Cap-de-Gone. We want to go back to making potato chips. That's a public [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=298.2s)]
*  private enterprise. Obviously companies aren't going to rush into Syria at this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=303.84s)]
*  point hardly. But over time there's got to be private sector engagement if [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=311.56s)]
*  you're going to put that economy on a good footing and keep the smile on the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=316.32s)]
*  face of the Syrian people. So Richard, you just heard the Admiral outline what [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=320.64s)]
*  he thinks the U.S. needs to do in the region. Secretary of State Blinken is in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  the area now. U.S. officials have started talking to the rebel government there, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=328.24s)]
*  but there's some competing interests. Israel's going to have a say. Iran's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=332.68s)]
*  going to want to say. Turkey wants to say. How do you see this structure being [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=335.88s)]
*  put in place? Well, I'm also on the skeptical side. The idea that you're going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=340.0s)]
*  to have a benign government that rules over all of Syria, that would make you a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=344.32s)]
*  cockeyed optimist. More likely to have a problematic government or probably [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  multiple places of autonomy. The Kurds, the Israelis will have their space. The [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=353.8s)]
*  Turks have their forces. Certain other groups, ISIS will come back in places. I [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=359.0s)]
*  think for the foreseeable future, Balkans like Syria seems more realistic. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  U.S. should do the kinds of things we're doing. But actually I think the bigger [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=369.04s)]
*  issues for the United States are not in Syria because I think there's a limited [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=371.8s)]
*  upside there. I would say focusing on Iran. Right now Iran is on its heels. How [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=374.44s)]
*  do we lock in the idea that Iran doesn't have a nuclear program that's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=379.12s)]
*  meaningful, doesn't continue support of proxies? Do you think Iran's rushing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=382.88s)]
*  toward a nuclear program given that they are at the weakest states they've been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=386.24s)]
*  since 79? Well, they've been moving gradually towards it over the last few [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=390.0s)]
*  months. What we want to do is stop it, ideally diplomatically, if need be [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=393.36s)]
*  militarily. That's something we would do with Israel. Also, we still have the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=396.68s)]
*  problem with Gaza, the hostages and so forth. So I think there's limited things [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=400.0s)]
*  you can do in Syria. If you look at the history of Syria, since its creation had [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=403.76s)]
*  divisions. It was an artificial construct of the French after World War [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=407.6s)]
*  I. The idea that we're gonna put Humpty Dumpty together again and make Syria [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=410.96s)]
*  Switzerland, okay, but a little bit idealistic. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZG39wFiq7U&t=414.28s)]
