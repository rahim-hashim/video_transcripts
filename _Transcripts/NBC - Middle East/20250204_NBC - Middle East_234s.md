# Trump: Palestinians 'have no alternative' but to leave 'pile of rubble' Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho)
*  President, will you continue to press for this idea that Jordan and Egypt take Palestinians from Gaza? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to see Jordan. I'd like to see Egypt take some look. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=5.0s)]
*  The Gaza thing has not worked. It's never worked. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=10.0s)]
*  And I feel very differently about Gaza than a lot of people. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=14.0s)]
*  I think they should get a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=18.0s)]
*  and we get some people to put up the money to build it and make it nice [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=22.0s)]
*  and make it habitable and enjoyable and make it a home. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=27.0s)]
*  You say they don't want to leave though. Palestinians say they don't want to leave. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=31.0s)]
*  I don't know how they could want to stay. It's a demolition site. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=34.0s)]
*  It's a pure demolition site. If we could find the right piece of land [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=39.0s)]
*  or numerous pieces of land and build them some really nice places [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=43.0s)]
*  with plenty of money in the area, that's for sure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=48.0s)]
*  I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=51.0s)]
*  which has had just decades and decades of death. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=55.0s)]
*  Where would those pieces of land be? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=58.0s)]
*  Well, they could be in Jordan, and they could be in Egypt, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=60.0s)]
*  and they could be in other places. You could have more than two, more than one, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=64.0s)]
*  but you could have more than two, and you'd have people living in a place [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=68.0s)]
*  that could be very beautiful and safe and nice. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=73.0s)]
*  Gaza's been a disaster for decades. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=76.0s)]
*  Would the US pay for that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=80.0s)]
*  I don't think the US would pay, but I think there's plenty of people that would in the area. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=83.0s)]
*  They have a lot of money. They certainly have a lot of money. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=88.0s)]
*  Some of the countries over there, they'd like to see it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=91.0s)]
*  I know that Saudi Arabia wants to see peace. I can see that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=93.0s)]
*  And many of the countries there, as far as I'm concerned, they all want peace. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=97.0s)]
*  I think, you know, maybe I'm wrong on this, but I think Iran would like to see peace too. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=102.0s)]
*  They've had enough. Don't you think they've had enough? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=106.0s)]
*  The leaders of Egypt and Jordan have said bluntly they have no interest in doing this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=109.0s)]
*  Well, they may have said that, but a lot of people said things to me. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=114.0s)]
*  They said they wouldn't take anybody back in Venezuela, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=117.0s)]
*  and right now they're flying them right back into Venezuela. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=120.0s)]
*  And a lot of people, and they're doing the right thing in Venezuela. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=123.0s)]
*  The Panama Canal is an active discussion right now. They said things about that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=126.0s)]
*  And virtually everything that's been said has been incorrectly stated based on the result. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=131.0s)]
*  Wouldn't that amount to forcibly displacing those people from Gaza? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=139.0s)]
*  I don't think so. I think if they had the opportunity, they'd love it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=144.0s)]
*  If they had an alternative to Gaza, they have no alternative right now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=147.0s)]
*  I mean, they're there because they have no alternative. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=150.0s)]
*  What do they have? It is a big pile of rubble right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=153.0s)]
*  I mean, have you seen the pictures of it? Have you been there? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=159.0s)]
*  It's terrible to live. Who can live like that? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=162.0s)]
*  And very dangerous. There's shooting all over the place. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=165.0s)]
*  There's bombing all over the place on both sides. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=168.0s)]
*  Now, I would think if they had an option of moving to either in a large group or various smaller groups [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=171.0s)]
*  and take care of the close to two million people, I would think that they would be thrilled to do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=178.0s)]
*  They have no, you know, when you say about the Gaza Strip, they don't have an option. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=184.0s)]
*  To be clear, you're saying they'd be thrilled to leave Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=188.0s)]
*  Oh, I think they'd love to leave Gaza if they had an option. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=192.0s)]
*  Right now, they don't have an option. What are they going to do? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=195.0s)]
*  They have to go back to Gaza. But what is Gaza? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=197.0s)]
*  It's practically not a building standing, and they're very dangerous. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=199.0s)]
*  You know, those buildings are shifting, and they're falling down all over the place, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=204.0s)]
*  and there's gunfire all over. It's going to be that way for a while. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoObxlfFSho&t=209.0s)]
