# Rebels claim to capture Syrian capital, bringing an end to Assad’s regime
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E)
*  ALISIA MANENDEZ, MSNBC HEDGQUARTERS, New York, July 7, 2020 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Alicia Menendez, live from MSNBC headquarters. It is 7 a.m. here in New [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=2.0s)]
*  York, 3 p.m. in the Syrian capital of Damascus, where we are following breaking news. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=6.16s)]
*  A coalition of Syrian militant groups claim they have toppled the Syrian government. Across [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=11.48s)]
*  Syria today, we are seeing celebrations in the streets after the rebels declared victory [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=16.14s)]
*  in the nation's 13-year civil war. The rebels addressed the nation on state TV, saying they [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=20.56s)]
*  overthrew President Bashar al-Assad's regime. NBC News has not independently confirmed the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=26.2s)]
*  rebels' claim. As for Assad, his location is still unknown. However, multiple media [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=31.4s)]
*  reports and the Russian government indicate he fled Damascus. NBC News has not confirmed [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=36.4s)]
*  his departure nor his whereabouts, and this new video shows Syrians inside the presidential [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=41.32s)]
*  palace in Damascus shortly after Assad's ouster. Truly stunning developments following a rapid [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=46.16s)]
*  two-week offensive that led to the capture of Syria's capital city. Joining us now from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  the White House, NBC News correspondent Ali Rafa. Ali, how is the Biden administration [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=57.28s)]
*  responding to what can only be described as a rapid turn of events? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=61.96s)]
*  Yeah, Alicia, good morning. Well, the National Security Council reacted to this major development [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=65.6s)]
*  overnight, saying that President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the events [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=71.18s)]
*  in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners. Now, U.S. officials have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=75.48s)]
*  been repeatedly asked about this worsening crisis in Syria over the last week since rebel [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=80.98s)]
*  forces seized the country's second largest city of Aleppo, kicking off this record-fast [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=86.42s)]
*  takeover that you mentioned. And they had issued caution when predicting if and when [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=91.42s)]
*  President Assad's regime would fall, saying it's impossible to tell when it would happen [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=96.62s)]
*  and how the upheaval would impact the U.S.'s footprint in Syria, because remember, the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=101.62s)]
*  U.S. has about 900 troops stationed in northern Syria to counter ISIS activity. And in recent [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=106.7s)]
*  days, obviously, it became clearer that this takeover could eventually happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=113.22s)]
*  Now, just yesterday, before rebel forces took over the capital of Damascus, National Security [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=118.14s)]
*  Advisor Jake Sullivan made clear how the U.S. views of these rebels, who are led by an Islamist [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  group labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S. Sullivan talking about what the U.S. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=130.18s)]
*  is focused on as this complicated scenario plays out. Listen to his comments here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=135.3s)]
*  We really think that there are three things we have to be particularly focused on. One, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=139.34s)]
*  that the fighting in Syria not lead to the resurgence of ISIS. And we are going to take [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=145.86s)]
*  steps ourselves directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  ensure that does not happen. Two, that our friends in the region, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  Syria, or who would potentially face spillover effects from Syria are strong and secure. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=161.42s)]
*  And we're in touch with them every day. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=167.1s)]
*  Now, Alicia, as far as what happens now, it's really still too soon to understand who among [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=169.1s)]
*  these factions of rebels will lead the country and how. But Sullivan actually said yesterday [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  the future of Syria should be up to the Syrian people. But obviously, a massive shift like [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=180.22s)]
*  impacts in the region that U.S. officials are closely monitoring. And as you heard the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=186.66s)]
*  NSC say, they're talking to partners in the region. As far as possible U.S. involvement [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=191.34s)]
*  from now on, Sullivan actually agreed with President-elect Trump's statement yesterday [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=196.42s)]
*  saying that this is not the U.S.'s fight to fight and it should avoid getting involved. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Alicia. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=205.98s)]
*  And this is Ali Rafa for us at the White House. Ali, thank you. Joining us now, former CIA [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=206.98s)]
*  John Brennan, Director Brennan, thank you so much for being with us. First, your reaction [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=212.38000000000002s)]
*  to what we have watched unfold just in the past 24 hours. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=218.22s)]
*  Well, Alicia, this is the culmination of nearly 14 years of rebellion in Syria against the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  Assad regime. And for many years, the various rebel groups were divided among themselves. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  But Hayat Tahrir Asham, known by HTS acronym, led by Abu Mohammed Al-Jalani, has been very [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=236.5s)]
*  successful and effective over the last several years in terms of bringing these groups together [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  and also moderating some of their public positions and stances. And so it has allowed them to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=250.26s)]
*  capitalize on the growing animosity within Syria against the Assad regime. So the very [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=255.89999999999998s)]
*  fast-falling Syrian government forces in the major cities, Aleppo, Hama and Homs, led to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=263.85999999999996s)]
*  this then assault on Damascus. And it was clear that the Syrian regime was not able [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  to repulse it, primarily because their outside backers, mainly Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=276.52s)]
*  were not able to bring to bear the capabilities that were needed to be able to stop this assault. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  So this is a major turning point. The Assad regime, first Hafez al-Assad, now Bashar [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  al-Assad, have controlled Syria for the past 50 years. But it really does present a number [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=295.94s)]
*  of challenges to folks in the region. The question is whether or not this moderation [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=302.38000000000005s)]
*  that Jalani has shown over the past several years is going to be sustained, because let's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=307.22s)]
*  make no bones about it. This is an Islamist group with many extremist factions. It has [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=313.1s)]
*  its roots in al-Qaeda. It has evolved over the years. But clearly it has been very, very [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=318.42s)]
*  effective just over the past couple of weeks in bringing down the Assad regime and Hafez [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=324.74s)]
*  al-Assad, or Bashar al-Assad, I'm sure is out of the country right now, or at least [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=330.14000000000004s)]
*  in the Alawi enclave. The Alawi is the religious sect that basically has ruled Syria over a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  number of years. But the Syrian population is a very diverse one, with Christians and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=343.02s)]
*  Jews and Druze and Shia and Sunni Muslims. But again, Abu Muhammad Jalani has been very [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  clever in terms of how he's been able to rally these forces and present a unified front [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=355.34s)]
*  against the Syrian government. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=361.38s)]
*  Let's talk about that moderation and that unified front on the part of Jalani. He's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  reassured minorities that he will not interfere with them. The international community has [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=367.5s)]
*  said that he opposes Islamist attacks abroad. How is U.S. intelligence assessing the sincerity [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=371.54s)]
*  of those claims? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's a tough question. I do believe that this has been rather politically expedient [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  for Jalani to demonstrate that he has been moderating. And in the areas of Syria that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  they have controlled over the past couple of years, such as in Idlib in the north, they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  have demonstrated a tolerance for religious diversity, and they have not imposed the strict [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=398.3s)]
*  Islamist standards that we have seen in other places. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=403.78s)]
*  Now, again, I think there are a number of factions within this coalition of rebel groups [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=407.98s)]
*  that are rather extreme. And the question is whether or not Jalani is going to be able [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=415.06s)]
*  to control them. It's one thing to tear down an authoritarian regime and to combine your [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=420.06s)]
*  forces against a common enemy. But now that it looks as though HTS is going to take over [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=427.7s)]
*  the government in Damascus, the big question is whether or not they're going to be able [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=433.38s)]
*  to stay on this moderate course or whether or not there are going to be some elements [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=437.66s)]
*  that are going to really challenge that moderation. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=442.42s)]
*  So the big key regional players here, Turkey, Russia, Iran. Let's talk about Iran first. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=445.74s)]
*  This from the New York Times, quote, a collapse of Iran's partnership with Syria would by [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=450.82s)]
*  all accounts reshape the balance of power in the Middle East. The axis of resistance [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=454.94s)]
*  that Iran has formed with its militant allies in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Syria, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=459.74s)]
*  Iraq and Yemen, would be weakened. Israel and its Arab allies would be strengthened. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=464.42s)]
*  How could the fall of the Assad regime impact the rest of the region? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=468.7s)]
*  Well, certainly it does undermine the Iranian efforts to have what's called a northern [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=473.7s)]
*  crescent, which would go from Iran through Iraq and then Syria and into Lebanon of the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=479.7s)]
*  Shia groups that are aligned with Iran, which is why the Iranians, the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=484.7s)]
*  Guard, have been so supportive of the Assad regime. But now the Iranians clearly are on [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=491.7s)]
*  their back foot across the region, whether it be in Lebanon or Yemen. Now in Syria, it [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=499.78000000000003s)]
*  seems as though they've lost a very, very strong partner. And again, HTS is a Sunni [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=506.78s)]
*  Islamist group that it would be adamantly opposed to any type of increased Iranian-Shia [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=511.73999999999995s)]
*  influence there. So it does upset the balance here. The question is what happens in the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=516.22s)]
*  coming months in terms of the orientation of the new government in Syria and Damascus [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  and whether or not it poses a threat to Israel. But again, this is reshaping it, as you pointed [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=530.6600000000001s)]
*  out, reshaping the political landscape in the Levant area and the Middle East more generally. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=538.1s)]
*  Director Brennan, I would like for you to walk me through the statement that we heard [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=543.5s)]
*  from NSA Sullivan saying that there are three things the Biden administration is focused [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=547.7s)]
*  on. The first, that the fighting in Syria not lead to the resurgence of ISIS. We're [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=554.34s)]
*  going to take steps ourselves directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen. What does that look like, sir? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=562.8199999999999s)]
*  Syria is a patchwork of all different groups, and as pointed out, we have aligned ourselves [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=567.22s)]
*  with the Syrian Democratic Front in the north, which is a Kurdish group, as a way to fight [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=573.1s)]
*  against ISIS and also to try to maintain some type of stability in that part of Syria. But [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=578.9399999999999s)]
*  there are also a lot of other groups inside of Syria. And I think what Jake Sullivan is [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=586.0200000000001s)]
*  saying is that it's still quite uncertain in terms of how this unfolding situation is [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=592.1s)]
*  going to develop. And we will be most interested in making sure that our key allies and partners [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=598.5s)]
*  in the area, namely Israel and Jordan and then the government in Iraq, are not going [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  to allow a resurgence of ISIS. Now, Abu Mohammed Al Jalani separated himself from ISIS, and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=610.06s)]
*  there were pitched battles among these various rebel groups, which undermined their ability [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=617.9s)]
*  to topple the Assad regime for many years. But it does seem as though he now has been [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=622.4399999999999s)]
*  able to concentrate power in his hands. But the question is whether or not a lot of these [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=626.9799999999999s)]
*  areas of Syria, which really are ungoverned and have been ungoverned for many years, will [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=631.26s)]
*  allow the rise once again of ISIS that could in fact challenge this, what appears to be [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=636.62s)]
*  a new government that is emerging in Damascus. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=643.1s)]
*  Director Brennan, you echoed something that Jake Sullivan said, which is an emphasis on [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=645.74s)]
*  regional partners, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, others who border Syria, who face spillover effects [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=651.58s)]
*  from Syria, saying he needs them to be strong and secure and saying, we are in touch with [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=657.46s)]
*  them every day. You have been inside those conversations in the past. Pull back the curtain [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=662.36s)]
*  for us. Give us a sense of the likely conversations that are happening between the Biden administration, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=667.12s)]
*  U.S. intelligence, Israel, Jordan and Iraq. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=672.96s)]
*  Well, the intelligence cooperation between the United States and its counterparts inside [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=675.52s)]
*  of Israel and Jordan and Iraq is very close. And I think what is most needed right now [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=681.04s)]
*  is to get as clear a picture as possible about what's going on inside of Syria, what's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=685.96s)]
*  going on inside of the leadership of the HTS, and to see whether or not we can pick up any [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=690.88s)]
*  early signs of which direction it's going to go. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=696.2800000000001s)]
*  This intelligence is so important to inform policymakers in these countries to be able to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=700.0s)]
*  coordinate the efforts to try to contain any type of Islamist extremist growth of [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=705.4s)]
*  capabilities and presence in the area there. So this is going to be a situation that is [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=714.0s)]
*  going to continue to evolve. It's going to go through the transition of the U.S. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=720.0s)]
*  presidential administration turnover from the Biden administration to the Trump administration. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=725.32s)]
*  This is an issue, I think, that is going to certainly be at the forefront of the U.S. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=730.68s)]
*  policymakers for quite some time again to see how this is all going to unfold. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=735.44s)]
*  I think there's still probably some fighting that's going to go on in inside of Syria. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=740.8s)]
*  The question is whether or not it can be kept inside of Syria and not spill over into [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=745.44s)]
*  neighboring states. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=750.16s)]
*  Former CIA Director John Brennan, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jPU-6XB_E&t=751.2s)]
