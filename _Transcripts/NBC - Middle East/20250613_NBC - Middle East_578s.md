# BREAKING: Iran launches missiles into Israel as reporter gives details from safe house
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg)
*  Joining us from Tel Aviv is NBC News correspondent Matt Bradley. Matt provided you and your crew in a safe location [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you please tell us what's going on? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=5.4s)]
*  We are hearing right now we are hearing outgoing missiles and we're hearing incoming missiles [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  So we're actually in the safe room right now [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=16.84s)]
*  On the left side of your screen just so you know what we're seeing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=20.76s)]
*  Attacks striking Tel Aviv and outgoing and we heard this from about 10 minutes ago [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=24.04s)]
*  The Israeli military said that there were a series of missiles that were fired from Iran [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=31.16s)]
*  This looks like the retaliation that we've been hearing broadcast by the Israeli military by Prime Minister [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, this is something that has been forecast for quite a while [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=42.28s)]
*  It was very much anticipated and now we're starting to hear quite a few explosions incoming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Guys we can also see on the left side of your screen [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=52.13999999999999s)]
*  We're watching the skyline now and it looks like those iron dome interceptors those are smoke lines [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=54.54s)]
*  You're seeing coming up from Israel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=58.81999999999999s)]
*  Obviously their job is to shoot down these munitions before they hit they are very successful [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  But it only takes one or two to get through to cause some damage [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=66.3s)]
*  Can you talk to us Matt about how concerned people are that if they if the Iranians fire enough? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=70.14s)]
*  It's just sheer volume that something is going to get through and people are going to get hurt [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not actually entirely sure if what we're hearing are interceptions or what we're hearing are impacts [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=82.61999999999999s)]
*  But you know, I'm with a bunch of people here who are veterans of this type of fighting and it sounds as though [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=87.5s)]
*  What we are hearing it could potentially it's a lot [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it could overwhelm these systems [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=98.1s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that there would be some kind of punishment from the Iranians when he spoke earlier [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=100.86s)]
*  We heard from Ayatollah Khamenei. He's the supreme guide the head of Iran [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=105.78s)]
*  He said that they were going to be some sort of retaliation whether or not this will actually [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=111.7s)]
*  Overwhelm Israel's formidable air defenses. That's yet to be seen [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  The fact of the matter is Israel has a three ply system and I think we're already hearing them coming into place [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  We're already hearing them in full effect right now as we speak shooting some of these missiles and drones out of the air right now [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=128.54s)]
*  So this is a very dangerous moment for this entire city and for all of Israel [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=136.5s)]
*  There are alerts all over the country right now [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=140.38s)]
*  So, you know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=144.74s)]
*  We're looking at yeah mine whether or not Israel's formidable system will stand and deflect this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=146.74s)]
*  We're looking at smoke rising from the skyline on the left side of your screen [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=152.58s)]
*  It's hard to tell at this point and we're waiting for information whether that's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=156.86s)]
*  Off trails from Iron Dome whether that's smoke from those collisions or whether these strikes have hit something there in the city, Matt [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=160.62s)]
*  I know you're in a safe place and it's hard for you to tell as well [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=167.88s)]
*  But I want to ask you is there a concern as Israel opens up or reignites a new front in this in this battle between [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=170.68s)]
*  Tel Aviv and Tehran that the Israeli military which is already involved in Gaza, which has already launched operations elsewhere could get overextended [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=179.2s)]
*  Or is this a fight Israel says it's ready to have [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=187.44s)]
*  Well, this is a fight that Israel has said they're ready to have Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made it very clear [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=193.24s)]
*  He's prepared for some sort of retaliation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=198.04s)]
*  He actually said that this was a mission that was planned for April and that for reasons [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  He didn't specify that they actually decided to delay it and they said that they came upon this idea [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=204.28s)]
*  Back in late last year after they assassinated [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  the leader of Hezbollah [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=213.64s)]
*  And now this is all basically because they decided that Israel or excuse me that Iran was then going to be moving quickly to a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=216.12s)]
*  Nuclear weapon capability because all of its proxies have basically been dismembered in the past year and a half and I'm talking about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which has since been overthrown [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  Militant groups in Iraq all of these groups have either been completely destroyed overthrown or otherwise engaged [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  He said that they were convinced that Iran would move toward nuclear capability in a very fast fashion [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=243.28000000000003s)]
*  That's why he said they needed to act now [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=249.24s)]
*  But we've already seen the Israeli government has called up military reservists. They've sent them to fighting positions all throughout the country [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  So it looks as though this country to the best of its ability [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Is ready to sustain or believes it's ready to sustain some sort of incoming punishment from the Iranians now again [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=261.64s)]
*  Whether or not that will overwhelm its missile defenses. That's another question [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=268.32s)]
*  Iran has never seen the kind of attack that Israel posed this morning and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=273.12s)]
*  Israel probably hasn't seen the kind of attack that the Iranians are about to retaliate with in the next couple of hours days or weeks [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  So it is very very uncertain and we don't really know whether or not Israel's formidable defenses will stand up [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=285.0s)]
*  And that we focus a lot on the physical damage and the concern around the nuclear sites [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=293.24s)]
*  But that wasn't the end of this operation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=297.68s)]
*  There were also some very targeted attacks against senior IRGC leadership [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=299.68s)]
*  The Israelis say they also took out the head of the IRGC Air Force [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=304.04s)]
*  These are jobs that obviously put these individuals in the crosshairs for these kinds of attacks [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=308.0s)]
*  But in addition they took out according to the according to the Israelis [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=313.12s)]
*  Senior Iranian nuclear scientists now the Trump administration's position had been that in part due to those previous attacks [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=317.96s)]
*  You mentioned Israel had seriously degraded Iran's capability both through its proxies IRGC has Bala things like that and just the command [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=325.32s)]
*  Structure of its military unit, which is why it thought it could get the Iranians to the table and make a more advantageous [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  Nuclear deal the second time around what does this do to those prospects you've heard on Iranian state TV? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  They said they're not coming to these scheduled talks with the Americans and Oman this weekend [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=347.54s)]
*  Does this make it harder for the US to get Iran back to the table? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is something that I asked an Israeli political analyst who's very close to the security establishment here [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=357.68s)]
*  And he said it could actually go either way [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=363.04s)]
*  It could actually force the Iranians to go back to the negotiating table cowed [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=365.24s)]
*  Humiliated to try to make some sort of deal with the Trump administration whose arms are still open [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=369.44s)]
*  Apparently to making some sort of nuclear deal and ending this emerging conflict [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=374.12s)]
*  It could also make them retrench themselves further and put them into a position where they would rush toward a nuclear weapon [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=378.56s)]
*  We know that they were on the position and a position where they had some breakout capability where they could [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=385.44s)]
*  Create a nuclear weapon and possibly use it [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=391.0s)]
*  Quite quickly now whether or not they're actually going to do that and which path their choose will depend almost entirely [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=394.8s)]
*  On how much damage Israel has done and will continue to do with this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  Comprehensive attack all across its nuclear facilities remember we heard a lot earlier today about how Israel had essentially destroyed the Natanz nuclear facility [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=406.24s)]
*  But it was only just in the past couple of hours that we started to hear about how [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis had attacked the Fordo facility now. This is one that is tucked deep inside a mountain [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=418.84s)]
*  It's much hard much harder to reach but we had just heard from Iranian state news agencies [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  Saying there had been explosions around that facility later in the day hours after the attack started [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=430.36s)]
*  So it could be that we're starting to see a much more comprehensive attack across all of these nuclear facilities [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=435.52s)]
*  As President Trump said whether or not Iran still has a nuclear program after all of this whether or not a treaty is necessary [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=441.64s)]
*  Is another question entirely now this analyst that I spoke with today again [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=448.24s)]
*  It was close to the security establishment and who has dealt with a lot of intelligence in the region [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=452.28s)]
*  He also said that Iran could kind of retrench itself back into its posture from back in the 1980s [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=457.12s)]
*  Before it had fully developed all of these proxy groups throughout the region and that is basically it could finance or plan terrorist acts [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=463.4s)]
*  Against Israel itself or against Israel Israeli diplomatic and military installations [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=470.64s)]
*  outside of Israel [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=475.92s)]
*  And against American targets against Jewish targets like synagogues [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  This is something that is another possibility [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=482.56s)]
*  Again, all of this is going to depend on the extent and the depth of the damage that we see coming out of this fight [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=485.08s)]
*  Which as Kira mentioned is still very much ongoing. We're still seeing this happening [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=491.12s)]
*  We're still seeing new lists new names of people who have been killed as my own. He was one of the heads of the IRGC [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  He was just good. He is the head he was just killed according to the Israelis as you mentioned the upper echelon of the entire [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force. They were wiped out in a single strike as they were meeting all together [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=512.08s)]
*  underground [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=518.64s)]
*  You mentioned the three main commanders of the Iranian military [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=519.76s)]
*  They were all killed five top nuclear scientists [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=524.6s)]
*  apparently according to the Iranians along with some of their family members were killed and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=527.88s)]
*  Iran's anti-aircraft capabilities and its ballistic missile capabilities [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=533.0s)]
*  So when we're talking about retaliation, it really is a big question [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=537.24s)]
*  Whether or not Iran is going to have the muscle to be able to retaliate in a big way [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=541.84s)]
*  We're starting to hear that now and once we get out of here [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=546.84s)]
*  We'll be able to have a look at just how bad the damage was and just where Iran stands in terms of its military capabilities [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=550.24s)]
*  You [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qLYKuqktg&t=562.24s)]
