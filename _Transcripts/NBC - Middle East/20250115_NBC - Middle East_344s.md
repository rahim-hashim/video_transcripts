# Hamas and Israel agree to ceasefire deal, hostages to be released
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY)
*  We begin with major breaking news out of the Middle East, where we can now report that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=0.0s)]
*  negotiators in Qatar have reached a Gaza ceasefire deal, and it has been accepted by Hamas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=4.28s)]
*  The agreement lays out a six-week initial ceasefire phase that would begin in a day [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=11.22s)]
*  or two. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=16.78s)]
*  Israelis go through a Cabinet process. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=17.78s)]
*  After that, there would be a 48-hour wait and then a gradual withdrawal of U.S. of Israeli [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=20.72s)]
*  forces. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  Of course, the most important thing is that after 48 hours from, whether it's Thursday [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=26.74s)]
*  night or Friday, the hostages would begin to be released from Gaza as early as this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=31.459999999999997s)]
*  weekend, Sunday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=38.94s)]
*  Israeli forces then would be withdrawing from central Gaza, from populated areas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=40.66s)]
*  There'd be a return of displaced Palestinians to North Gaza. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=45.22s)]
*  Under the deal, 33 hostages would come out initially, including all women, including [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=49.06s)]
*  soldiers, civilians, children, and men over 50. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=56.38s)]
*  We understand in that group there would be some Americans. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=59.82s)]
*  Some Americans, we know that there are at least three surviving Americans that we've [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=63.96s)]
*  been in touch with, and one of the elderly is Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel's husband, who [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  is 65 years old and would be one of the first Americans, he would be the first American [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=74.58s)]
*  to come out, as well as injured Americans. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=79.1s)]
*  There are two others that we know of who would likely be coming out in that first group. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=82.78s)]
*  We begin our coverage of this major breaking news with NBC News International correspondent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  Danielle Hemanjian live in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=91.94s)]
*  Danielle, what are we hearing about where the negotiations are? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=94.86s)]
*  My information is that it's been confirmed by officials here in Washington, but that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=98.26s)]
*  they are by agreement, they are letting the Qataris announce it first in Doha, who have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=106.26s)]
*  really been the go-betweens with Hamas and who have been the principal point for the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  negotiations with participation, of course, from Egypt. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=119.5s)]
*  Danielle? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=124.14s)]
*  You're absolutely right, Andrea, and we are being briefed on the fact that this is it, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=126.42s)]
*  the deal is done, and we are now waiting. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  As you say, for the mediators in Doha, the Qatari PM will be holding a press conference [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=134.06s)]
*  and we await now the official announcement. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=140.02s)]
*  But to think that this has taken 15 months when most of those involved in these talks [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=143.62s)]
*  thought that it would take perhaps a matter of days, perhaps weeks to get all those hostages [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=149.9s)]
*  back, it's taken 15 agonizing months, agony for the civilians in Gaza who have endured [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=154.82s)]
*  relentless airstrikes, agony for the hostages who for the most part and presumably have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=162.5s)]
*  been held in tunnels, and agony for the family members of those hostages who, in some cases, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  live just a few miles away from Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=176.54s)]
*  They go to bed at night, wake up in the morning not knowing if their loved ones are dead or [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=179.14s)]
*  alive. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  But here we are and we are waiting for the Qatari Prime Minister to lay out the details [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  of this proposal that has been approved and accepted by both sides. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=191.7s)]
*  What we know according to the Reuters news agency is that as has been reported over the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=197.06s)]
*  past few days, we know that in the first stage of this deal, which would last six weeks, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=202.62s)]
*  33 hostages will be released on humanitarian ground. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=208.66s)]
*  It was 34 up until last week. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=213.3s)]
*  One more hostage was found dead in a tunnel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=215.54s)]
*  We are going to be all women, children and civilians over the age of 50, those who are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=218.26s)]
*  ill and severely injured. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=223.5s)]
*  What we now know is that in return, in exchange for the release of those hostages, hundreds [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  and hundreds of Palestinian detainees will be released. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=233.16s)]
*  Now it's worth pointing out here that since October 7th, 2023, Israel has arrested thousands [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=237.22s)]
*  of people in the West Bank, many of them held in what's called administrative detention. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  They have not been charged, they have not been tried and Israel stands accused of amassing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=249.74s)]
*  all these Palestinians just for this moment to be able to release them in this deal. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=255.1s)]
*  So what we understand according to various reports in Israeli media as well as the Reuters [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=261.06s)]
*  news agency is that for every civilian that will be civilian hostage who will be released, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=265.94s)]
*  30 Palestinians will be released in exchange. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=272.38s)]
*  For every female soldier, 50 Palestinian prisoners will be released. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=275.94s)]
*  Now according to a senior Israeli official, they said to me that they know that there [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  was a price to pay for the hostages and they know that there was a quote special price [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=285.62s)]
*  to pay for the female hostages. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  So hundreds are expected to be released. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  During this period there will be a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from central [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=296.54s)]
*  Gaza from the more densely populated areas to a buffer zone along the border. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=302.42s)]
*  They will also withdraw from what's called the Netzerim corridor which runs east to west [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=308.78s)]
*  and effectively splits the Gaza Strip in half allowing for the hundreds of thousands of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=313.86s)]
*  Gazans who have been displaced back to northern Gaza. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=319.58s)]
*  Andrea. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=323.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF23fwvuRfY&t=326.5s)]
