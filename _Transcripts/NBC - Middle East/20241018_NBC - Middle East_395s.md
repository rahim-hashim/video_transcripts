# ‘Justice has been served’: Father of American-Israeli hostage speaks out
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM)
*  And joining us now is Sigi's father, Jonathan Dechelchan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan, it's so good to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=4.0s)]
*  I was thinking about you yesterday and, of course, the other parents and relatives. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=6.0s)]
*  What is your immediate reaction? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=10.0s)]
*  What do you think the impact will be of Sinwa's death? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, first reaction, you know, sort of the obvious one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=16.0s)]
*  Justice has been served. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=20.0s)]
*  Humanity will not miss Yechia Sinwa. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=22.0s)]
*  As far as what does this mean for the hostages, we really don't know. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=26.0s)]
*  There are two, generally speaking, two possible directions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=32.0s)]
*  The first direction is the opening of opportunities that didn't exist. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=36.0s)]
*  Sort of this undisputed leader of Hamas following the assassination of Ismail Aynia, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=40.0s)]
*  sort of the singular leader, both military and political, is gone unexpectedly. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=46.0s)]
*  And that may allow, it should allow for opportunities to renew negotiations [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=52.0s)]
*  and bring them home and perhaps explore other alternatives of how to get hostages out [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=59.0s)]
*  in a non-military matter, given the chaos that probably is running rampant through Hamas right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=65.0s)]
*  So that's one possibility. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=72.0s)]
*  And the other possibility is that Hamas fighters now, those that are holding the hostages, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=74.0s)]
*  who knows what's going through their mind right now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=82.0s)]
*  They could exact vengeance on the hostages, those that are still alive. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=86.0s)]
*  They may be panicking and, you know, who knows what they would do to the hostages at that moment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=91.0s)]
*  But it's very difficult to know, and it only reinforces the urgency of getting them home [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=98.0s)]
*  and stopping the madness in Gaza. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=106.0s)]
*  Now, the prime minister said yesterday that the war will continue, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=109.0s)]
*  and perhaps he had to signal that to Israel's enemies as a deterrent. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=113.0s)]
*  But do you think he's really committed to that? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=119.0s)]
*  Because U.S. officials from the president on down are saying, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=121.0s)]
*  Fair enough, this has been a successful military operation with a horrendous cost, of course, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=124.0s)]
*  for the people of Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=131.0s)]
*  Now, what about the hostages? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=134.0s)]
*  Do you think he will? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=136.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=138.0s)]
*  His track record is not good for really focusing on the hostages as the main war goal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=139.0s)]
*  So it's hard to say. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=150.0s)]
*  What I can say certainly is that I think what he declared yesterday about the ongoing war, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=151.0s)]
*  perhaps it was meant for the ears of Israel's enemies, and they exist, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=157.0s)]
*  but I think it was meant no less for his domestic coalition partners from the radical right, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=162.0s)]
*  who seem to have committed to a kind of perpetual war, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=169.0s)]
*  whether it's with all the enemies of Israel as they see them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=173.0s)]
*  And so there is real worry among the hostage families that instead of using this opportunity, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=177.0s)]
*  that kind of came as a surprise to Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=182.0s)]
*  This was not a planned operation in the conventional sense, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=185.0s)]
*  that instead of seizing on this kind of gift that was given, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=189.0s)]
*  the end of Sinwar, to really pull out all the stops to get hostages home, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=193.0s)]
*  Netanyahu and his coalition partners will use this to beat their chests [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=201.0s)]
*  and show it as some kind of bizarre proof that military action on its own [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=206.0s)]
*  is really what they're looking for and can get the hostages home, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=215.0s)]
*  which of course is complete nonsense. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=218.0s)]
*  It was nonsense 24 hours ago as it is right now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=220.0s)]
*  The Israeli military itself has said repeatedly in recent months [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=225.0s)]
*  that Hamas, before the death of Sinwar, had been degraded enough militarily [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=233.0s)]
*  and as a governing organization that no further sacrifice of hostages' lives [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=238.0s)]
*  could be substantiated by incremental military gains. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=244.0s)]
*  Now Sinwar has been killed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=248.0s)]
*  And so there really is no other justification available that's legitimate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=251.0s)]
*  for the Israeli government to not go full bore, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=257.0s)]
*  be it negotiations or other arrangements with Hamas fighters, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=262.0s)]
*  to get the hostages out and to end this madness [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=267.0s)]
*  that has caused such suffering amongst the civilians in Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=272.0s)]
*  Have you heard from the administration here? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=277.0s)]
*  Yes, most definitely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=280.0s)]
*  The U.S. families, the families of those seven hostages that you showed before, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=282.0s)]
*  we've already since yesterday have had two conversations [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=287.0s)]
*  both with State Department officials [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=290.0s)]
*  and very shortly we'll be having talk, video talk, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=293.0s)]
*  with a very senior member of the White House staff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=297.0s)]
*  And so those, you know, it's been sort of the one constant, I think, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=301.0s)]
*  that we as hostage families can count on is the engagement of the administration [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=307.0s)]
*  and the offices of the U.S. government. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=311.0s)]
*  So there's no change. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=314.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, what would you like Secretary Blinken, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=316.0s)]
*  who's apparently going to be going, to say to Bibi Netanyahu? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=318.0s)]
*  Well, I guess, you know, he could congratulate, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=324.0s)]
*  Secretary Blinken could congratulate our Prime Minister [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=328.0s)]
*  on successful conclusion of the war against Hamas. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=331.0s)]
*  I think that it is time to look towards how to resolve the crisis [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=336.0s)]
*  and the resolution of the crisis is not more killing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=342.0s)]
*  It is getting the hostages home that will facilitate a ceasefire [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=346.0s)]
*  and figuring out what in the world is going to become of Gaza [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=351.0s)]
*  the day after Sinwar and Hamas [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=355.0s)]
*  and under no circumstances to go along with the Israeli government [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=359.0s)]
*  insisting that, well, now that we have them on the ropes, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=367.0s)]
*  let's really beat them down completely [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=370.0s)]
*  because it's simply not justified by facts on the ground. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=372.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbBL6dtYgM&t=389.0s)]
