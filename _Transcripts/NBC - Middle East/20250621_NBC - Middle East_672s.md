# Trump 'should have put America first': Top Dem condemns Iran bombing
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE)
*  Welcome back everyone. We are continuing our breaking news coverage. President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump announcing tonight that Iran's key nuclear facilities were quote totally [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  obliterated by the US Air Force. A Saudi nuclear regulator says no radioactive [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=9.08s)]
*  traces have been detected in the kingdom or Arab Gulf states as a result of US [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=16.92s)]
*  strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=21.64s)]
*  just sent out this statement saying quote President Trump must provide the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  American people in Congress clear answers on the actions taken tonight and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=29.7s)]
*  their implications for the safety of Americans. No president should be allowed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=33.54s)]
*  to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=37.5s)]
*  erratic threats and no strategy. We must enforce the War Powers Act and I'm urging [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=42.1s)]
*  Leader Thune to put it on the Senate floor immediately. I'm voting for it and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=46.94s)]
*  implore all senators on both sides of the aisle to vote for it. With me now is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=51.54s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith a Democrat from Washington and the ranking member of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=56.22s)]
*  Armed Services Committee. Congressman it's great to see you again. Let me just [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=60.42s)]
*  ask you did you have any indication any insight as to whether or not this was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=64.32s)]
*  happening tonight when the president was returning to the White House for this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=67.86s)]
*  national security meeting? Not directly they didn't say that but certainly for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  what President Trump has said the repositioning of the B-2 bombers and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  other forces and just his general vibe the last several days it was not [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=79.78s)]
*  surprising but no there was no heads up that I'm aware of given to any [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  congressional leaders. I read your statement that you posted which I think [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=88.44s)]
*  there are a lot of very important parts to it and I wanted to kind of just go [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=92.56s)]
*  you know through it with you a little bit. One of the points that you made [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=96.12s)]
*  which I have not yet heard this evening from any American officials and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=100.56s)]
*  certainly as I read some statements from American officials members of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Congress questioning the legality of this strike you want to step further you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=107.48s)]
*  said the president failed to provide clear objectives for these actions and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=111.4s)]
*  there are no guarantees that it will eliminate the possibility of Iran [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=114.64s)]
*  developing a nuclear weapon or how long it might set their program back. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=119.12s)]
*  Elaborate on that and why you thought that was important to include tonight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=124.72s)]
*  Sure several pieces to this I mean first of all obviously there are other issues [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=128.44s)]
*  with Iran than just their nuclear program you know they are sponsoring a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=132.8s)]
*  variety of different terrorist groups throughout the region destabilizing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=136.6s)]
*  governments they have a ballistic missile program that is a threat but on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  the nuclear program the only thing that stopped the Iranian nuclear program was [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=143.2s)]
*  the JCPOA that President Obama negotiated. Everyone agrees that Iran was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=148.48s)]
*  abiding by that and they had stopped enriching uranium and they had stopped [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  moving towards developing a bomb and then of course President Trump tore up [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=157.48s)]
*  the agreement and Iran went back to enriching uranium and moving towards the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  bomb. Now the military estimations can you stop this can you drop a bunch of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=166.38s)]
*  bombs and A blow up all the centrifuges that we know about we don't know that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=170.98s)]
*  now President Trump in his typical fashion you know claims facts not in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=175.74s)]
*  evidence saying we totally obliterated their whole program nobody knows that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=179.06s)]
*  right now maybe maybe not we do not know how many of these centrifuges were [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  destroyed so that's number one number two we can't be a hundred percent sure [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=189.62s)]
*  that we knew about all of Iran's centrifuges we didn't know about fordo [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  for about a decade before we discovered it and number three no one has talked [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=199.14s)]
*  about well how quickly could Iran reconstitute all of this it sadly does [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=203.22s)]
*  not take that long to build centrifuges once you know how so it's not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=207.54s)]
*  necessarily that the death blow to Iran's nuclear program we're still going [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=212.06s)]
*  to have to negotiate with them at some point so you know this this assumption [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=216.89999999999998s)]
*  that their nuclear program is gone and they'll never be able to build it is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=221.1s)]
*  simply wrong at this point you use the word condemn in the strongest terms the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=224.9s)]
*  president's decision again I think very powerful words tonight and you also [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=230.1s)]
*  said that the path the president has chosen risks unleashing a wider war in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=235.06s)]
*  the region that is both incredibly unpredictable and treacherous and that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  threatens the safety and the security of the United States Israel and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=243.42s)]
*  ultimately the world I get a sense sir and please correct me if I'm wrong based [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=246.78s)]
*  on that language you're extremely disappointed with what the president [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=253.66s)]
*  has done tonight well what disappointed would be the wrong word just [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=257.14s)]
*  disappointed implies expectations but but I think it I think it was wrong I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=261.26s)]
*  think it was a mistake and the point is we have forces throughout the region in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=266.18s)]
*  Qatar and Bahrain in Iraq in the UAE I was just there as it happens two months [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=270.9s)]
*  ago and I in all of those countries and visited our forces and they are all very [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=276.14s)]
*  vulnerable to Iranian attack now we'll see I mean I you know the future is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  notoriously hard to predict who knows for sure what Iran is going to do but I [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=284.94s)]
*  sure be surprised if Iran simply capitulated at this point and if they [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  attack all of those forces are a jeopardy now we have force protection [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=294.5s)]
*  methods in place they're not perfect they're not necessarily going to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=298.46s)]
*  protect all of our forces and if Iran does that then what does the president [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=302.86s)]
*  do in response does he just let that go that that seems unlikely look this is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=307.1s)]
*  the same thing back in Iraq Saddam Hussein was a terrible guy we didn't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  know whether or not Saddam Hussein was working towards a nuclear weapon back [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=317.54s)]
*  then because he wasn't being transparent about it and you can imagine a world [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=320.94s)]
*  but gosh it would just remove this guy you know how much better would things be [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=324.38s)]
*  sure but you don't know what comes next and that's the lesson we learned you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=328.54s)]
*  know President Trump has not said anything yet about whether or not regime [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=334.26000000000005s)]
*  change is part of his objective you know if it is that's incredibly problematic [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=337.66s)]
*  if it isn't he should state clearly that it isn't the best we can hope for now is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=343.26000000000005s)]
*  that Iran does feel you know backed in fact into a corner is the wrong word [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  Iran decides to capitulate and they come out and they negotiate in good faith [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=354.18s)]
*  and we get to a peaceful resolution but that is a huge roll of the dice and then [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=358.5s)]
*  of course there is the constitutional issue that the president had no [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=365.26s)]
*  authority to start a war with Iran which make no mistake about it that's what he [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=368.82s)]
*  did where that war goes hard to say but he started a war with Iran tonight and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=373.02s)]
*  what do you think is Israel's responsibility in getting the US into [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=377.94s)]
*  this moment I mean the president is certainly by some assessment and again [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=382.62s)]
*  you used very strong language against the president United States what [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=386.38s)]
*  responsibility does Israel have for starting this war nine days ago knowing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=389.86s)]
*  ultimately that America was always going to come to Israel's defense at some point [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=394.54s)]
*  and perhaps even get involved in this war on behalf of Israel I mean it's safe [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=399.18s)]
*  to say the United States would not have been doing this tonight if Israel had [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=404.58s)]
*  not started this unprovoked war nine days ago [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=409.02s)]
*  yeah well I'm a well sorry that last sentence I got to get back to you in just [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=411.78s)]
*  second but I'm a big personal responsibility person this isn't Israel's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=416.06s)]
*  fault it's not Israel's fault that the Donald Trump decided to bomb yeah they [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=420.06s)]
*  wanted him to but he's the president United States he doesn't have to do what [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=423.62s)]
*  Israel tells him to do so let's not make any mistake about that second you know [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=427.42s)]
*  Iran has definitely been provoking Israel Iran from its founding has had it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=431.94s)]
*  as one of its central tenants that Israel doesn't have a right to exist [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=437.98s)]
*  which is you know pretty much an unprecedented foreign policy except for [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=441.7s)]
*  Russia now in Ukraine Iran has supported Hezbollah Hamas the Houthis and various [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=445.94s)]
*  other groups that have directly attacked Israel so that Israel had a reason to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=451.62s)]
*  attack Iran I will not question the US doesn't and the US as I mentioned has [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=456.5s)]
*  forces in the region they're at risk there is no question that Prime Minister [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=462.9s)]
*  Netanyahu and Israel put a ton of pressure on Donald Trump to do this he [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=466.58s)]
*  didn't have to he could have put our interests sorry I'm just gonna go ahead [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=470.86s)]
*  and say it he could have put America first you know but it doesn't seem like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=474.54s)]
*  that's the decision that he made and the consequences of it going forward are as [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=479.1s)]
*  I have said very unpredictable and certainly dangerous for US interests I'm [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=483.62s)]
*  sure you've seen certainly within the MAGA world and within the Republican [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=488.54s)]
*  Party some who agree with you that this is not a war that America should have [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  gotten into it is not an America first policy Tom Massey called the strikes [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=494.82s)]
*  tonight unconstitutional what should the Democrats be doing right now I mean [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=499.22s)]
*  the fact that these questions this criticism was coming out from the Tucker [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=505.14000000000004s)]
*  Carlson's of the world and the Steve Bannon's of the world and not from some [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=508.42s)]
*  of the senior leaders of the Democratic Party before tonight we're seeing it a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=512.5400000000001s)]
*  little bit tonight but not before tonight where does it go from here? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=516.3000000000001s)]
*  Sorry I've been saying don't do this don't do this don't do this for the last [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=520.4200000000001s)]
*  two or three weeks I don't know what other leaders have been saying that but [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=524.98s)]
*  the statement I put out tonight is perfectly consistent with everything I've [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=528.74s)]
*  been saying since this story absolutely but I think the really important point [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=531.66s)]
*  here is where does US national security and foreign policy go and the thing that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=536.02s)]
*  I kind of agree with is that we need to get off of this sort of end of the Cold [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  War thinking that we can just move the pieces of the world around like they're [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  our chessboard that we're the world's sole remaining superpower right so [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmzHOVmiuE&t=551.06s)]
