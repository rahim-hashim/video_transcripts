Video Description: President Trump announces that U.S. forces bombed three nuclear sites in Iran. Retired four-star General Barry McCaffrey talks with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace moments after Trump’s address to the nation. McCaffrey says the bombing will have a “long term impact on Iran’s nuclear program” and called the decision “bold,” but also warned Iran is likely to retaliate in some way.

# 'Decisive' and 'bold': Retired four-star general reacts to Trump bombing Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw)
*  General McCaffrey, tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Donald Trump announced a news briefing at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Pentagon with his chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Cain, and his secretary of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=4.8s)]
*  defense, Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=9.36s)]
*  What do you expect we will hear from them? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=11.26s)]
*  Well, for one thing, I'm sure they're going to reinforce the president's message. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=14.08s)]
*  I think, from a strictly military perspective, this is a decisive, bold, consequential attack. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=19.88s)]
*  Iran was in a weakened condition. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=26.52s)]
*  The U.S. had the technology to carry out what is probably a long-term impact on Iran's nuclear [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  program. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=37.44s)]
*  So, I was surprised he ordered the attack. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=38.44s)]
*  But I think it was, in many ways, a bold and good move, certainly for Israel and, to some [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=42.4s)]
*  extent, for the United States. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=49.76s)]
*  Now comes—and, by the way, the reason I was surprised, I think it's a political disaster [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  for him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=55.92s)]
*  His own parties split apart on the issue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  The Democrats oppose it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  The American people oppose it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=61.44s)]
*  And it presumes there won't be an Iranian counterstrike. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=63.64s)]
*  I can't imagine why, in the next 72 hours, even in their weakened state, they don't come [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=68.08s)]
*  up with a series of moves which should then generate, in my view, commitment of U.S. air [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=74.36s)]
*  and naval forces to attacking Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=83.0s)]
*  So, we're at war with Iran right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  We'll have to see what happens. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=89.0s)]
*  The other thing I would also assert, though, is you cannot destroy the Iranian nuclear [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=92.4s)]
*  program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=97.2s)]
*  You can set it back a year or 10 years, but the people, the technology, the knowledge [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=98.2s)]
*  is all there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=104.4s)]
*  The North Koreans, a primitive state, now have a viable nuclear attack capability on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=105.4s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=114.0s)]
*  So we're headed for troubled waters. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=116.0s)]
*  It might be an incentive for negotiations in the coming months, but tomorrow is going [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  to be a dangerous day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=125.32s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=127.96s)]
*  You just said, we are at war against Iran. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  It is a sentence that Donald Trump did not utter in his remarks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=131.68s)]
*  Do you think he believes or sees the country at war with Iran? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=135.56s)]
*  No. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=140.24s)]
*  I think he believes this is a one-off, and he's hopeful that they'll now come back to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=146.48s)]
*  You know, I think he's probably incorrect on that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=149.88s)]
*  Again, I would assert that the Iranians have very few viable military options, one of which [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=152.44s)]
*  is, however, to close the Persian Gulf, affect the price of oil dramatically, conduct terrorism [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=159.6s)]
*  campaigns against the United States directly or in our allies. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=165.28s)]
*  Certainly cyberattacks is another possible, even likely outcome of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  And then what will we do? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=177.76s)]
*  Will we just ignore it and sort of wait for the further development of the situation? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=179.04s)]
*  I think we'll take immediate action. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=184.04s)]
*  We have a lot of military power in the region. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=185.72s)]
*  There are two carrier battle groups there now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=188.76s)]
*  A third has been alerted to deploy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=190.76s)]
*  There's a lot of U.S. Air Force aircraft on the ground, not just in Saudi Arabia and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=193.12s)]
*  the Gulf states, but also in Italy and the U.K. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=198.32s)]
*  So the potential to conduct a significant air campaign against Iran is there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=202.72s)]
*  And if they strike us in a significant way, if there's a golden BB that lands on a U.S. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=208.92s)]
*  destroyer in the Arabian Sea, then we'll up the ante considerably and almost immediately. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=216.88s)]
*  What does it mean for the country at large to be, as you said, at war with Iran or on [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  a war footing with Iran? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=232.16s)]
*  I cannot imagine it will be well received. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=235.2s)]
*  The Republican Party will rally behind them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm relatively sure the majority of certainly congressional and governors who are all eyeing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  future presidential contests. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  But the American people will be, will wait and see how it comes out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  Will we be hurt by the Iranian response? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=255.36s)]
*  Will this go badly wrong? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  One thing won't happen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  There will be no Israeli ground combat intervention in Iraq. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=262.16s)]
*  Special ops, Mossad, sure. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=268.16s)]
*  There will be no U.S. ground troops committed to an assault on Iran, although if we made [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=270.72s)]
*  up our mind to do it, we could clearly carry out that operation also. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  So I think what President Trump is hopeful for is very little response and a return to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  I'd be dubious if that's the likely outcome in the short run. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N572_JD8xFw&t=288.8s)]
