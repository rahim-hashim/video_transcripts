# Two Palestinians arrested after car ramming attack in Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc)
*  Breaking news now out of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=0.0s)]
*  Police have arrested two Palestinians suspected of a car ramming attack in a suburb about [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=2.44s)]
*  30 minutes outside Tel Aviv this morning, killing at least one person and wounding at [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  least a dozen others. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=11.8s)]
*  NBC's Richard Engel is live for us in the region. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=13.52s)]
*  Richard, we just marked 100 days of the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=15.72s)]
*  What more are we learning about this car attack? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  So this car attack happened just north of Tel Aviv in an area called Ranaana and carried [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=25.8s)]
*  out allegedly by two, this is according to the police, two Palestinian men from Hebron. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=31.96s)]
*  They had entered Israel illegally. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=37.36s)]
*  They carjacked several vehicles, three different vehicles. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=40.08s)]
*  They were armed with knives and they moved from vehicle to vehicle. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=43.56s)]
*  So they would use one vehicle to run people over, then switch to the next car, run more [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=47.96s)]
*  people over, stabbing people along the way, killed a 79-year-old woman and injured 17 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=53.06s)]
*  other people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=60.82s)]
*  The situation was quite quickly contained. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  Israeli police moved in a helicopter in the area to search for any additional suspects [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=65.42s)]
*  and they are considering it a terrorist attack. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=72.34s)]
*  Very different kind of scene than we saw 100 days ago or 101 days ago now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=75.98s)]
*  What we saw earlier today was much more typical of the kind of attacks that have taken place [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=83.26s)]
*  in Israel over the last 20 years or so, where you have relatively low-level attacks carried [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=89.14s)]
*  out by one or two militants and they are quickly contained, either killed or arrested. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=95.84s)]
*  This was all over in a matter of minutes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=104.96s)]
*  Within certainly an hour, it was all completed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=108.6s)]
*  What happened on October 7th was 3,000 militants or upwards of 3,000 militants, according to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=111.6s)]
*  Israeli officials, crossed over the border from Gaza in dozens of locations in military-style [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  uniforms, armed in vehicles, in tractors, and went on a murder spree and a kidnapping [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=129.08s)]
*  spree for hours before there was any kind of response. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  So there is still shock in this country, still outrage that this country was so ill-prepared, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=144.24s)]
*  so surprised that 100 days ago there was that level of attack when several thousand [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=151.74s)]
*  Hamas and other militants were able to break out of Gaza and then effectively have free [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=158.34s)]
*  reign in southern Israel for the better part of a day before there was a significant response. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  It actually took about a week before Israeli forces were able to drive all of the fighters [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=172.5s)]
*  out of the country and send them back into Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  Now we've seen for the last 100 days the punishing Israeli military response that according [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=181.1s)]
*  to health officials in Gaza run by the Ministry of Health run by Hamas has killed more than [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  24,000 people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  Richard Engel reporting for us from Jerusalem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=197.94s)]
*  Thank you for all of that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oymetgp5XPc&t=200.66s)]
