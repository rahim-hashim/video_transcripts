Video Description: Senator Chis Coons (D-DE) joins Andrea Mitchell to discuss President Trump’s announcement that the U.S. may take an “ownership” position of Gaza: “Gaza today is a humanitarian disaster. There is very little water, food, housing, it has largely been destroyed in the war since the October, 7 attack by Israel,” Coons added. “He is an unconventional president who's more used to leadership on reality TV than on the complex diplomatic field of a place like the Middle East."

# Trump’s Gaza announcement is a ‘dangerous distraction’: Sen. Coons
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI)
*  When Democratic Senator Chris Coons heard that President Trump said the U.S. will take [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=0.0s)]
*  over the Gaza Strip, he was talking to Frank Thorpe, our top congressional producer, and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=4.64s)]
*  he covered his face in disbelief, telling NBC News that, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=9.6s)]
*  You can report I was speechless. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=13.68s)]
*  That's what he told Thorpe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=15.88s)]
*  Joining me now, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, member of the Foreign Relations [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=17.52s)]
*  Judiciary and Appropriations Committees, and a former, I believe, subcommittee chair of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=21.32s)]
*  the Africa Subcommittee, someone who has had long involvement with PEPFAR and other of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=26.88s)]
*  our foreign aid programs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=32.28s)]
*  You've had time now to process the news about Gaza that came yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=34.28s)]
*  In a prepared statement, clearly, the president was reading notes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=38.44s)]
*  What's your reaction to the president of the United States? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, Andrea, I thought the announcement by Trump, which seemed to surprise even Prime [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=43.76s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu, that we would occupy Gaza and forcibly relocate two million Palestinians [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=49.04s)]
*  when the neighboring countries, Egypt and Jordan, do not want Palestinians to be forcibly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=56.8s)]
*  relocated to their territory, and Gazans are not seeking to be relocated, struck me as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  a dangerous distraction. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=69.32s)]
*  Part of why I had that expression was I had just come from the floor of the Senate, where [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=71.96s)]
*  I was talking earnestly, eagerly, pressing a whole group of my colleagues about the importance [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=76.24s)]
*  of foreign aid and what is going on right now, where President Trump is effectively [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=83.32s)]
*  shutting down the global network of programs that keep us safer and stronger, that help [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=88.27999999999999s)]
*  prevent public health diseases, outbreaks like Ebola in Uganda from getting to the United [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=99.8s)]
*  They help counter human trafficking in countries like Mexico. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=100.8s)]
*  They help provide stability and security in countries that have been torn apart by civil [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=105.08s)]
*  war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  The Chinese are already moving into some of the spaces we're leaving because of our withdrawal [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=112.08s)]
*  from foreign assistance around the world. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=117.48s)]
*  And I think who's going to be cheering the decision by President Trump to shut down USAID [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=119.84s)]
*  and foreign aid is terrorists and traffickers, China and Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=125.2s)]
*  His further suggestion, Andrea, that we should somehow go into the Gaza Strip, occupy it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=129.96s)]
*  and rebuild it, I think is both a distraction from what's going on, the pushback on Elon [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=135.0s)]
*  Musk and his role in shutting down foreign aid and a dangerous and ill conceived proposal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=140.92s)]
*  Do you worry about the safety of the hostages that Islamic Jihad or Hamas could retaliate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  because of this? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, a ceasefire was in place. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Hostages were being released. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  There was a path forward. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=163.88s)]
*  And now President Trump has thrown it all into chaos again with a out of the box proposal [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=166.72s)]
*  that nobody saw coming. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=173.6s)]
*  He is an unconventional president who's more used to leadership on reality TV than on the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=175.48s)]
*  complex diplomatic field of a place like the Middle East. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=180.96s)]
*  The heads of state of all the surrounding countries have worked with the United States [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=185.0s)]
*  to try and move forward a regional plan for peace. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=189.92s)]
*  It did not include forcibly relocating millions of Palestinians. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=193.36s)]
*  Let me also add, Andrea, that Gaza today is a humanitarian disaster. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=197.68s)]
*  There is very little water, food, housing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  It has largely been destroyed in the war since the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=207.34s)]
*  And President Trump is right now laying off exactly those Americans who have experience [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  dealing with refugees, with folks who need clean water and public health and safety and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=220.52s)]
*  who need shelter. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=227.28s)]
*  That's what USAID does. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=228.8s)]
*  They respond to natural disasters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=230.76s)]
*  When there's a hurricane or an earthquake, they send in the so-called DART team from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=233.2s)]
*  AID and they have partners around the world. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=238.64s)]
*  It's exactly the folks who could make that recovery in Gaza possible who are being defunded [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=241.32s)]
*  and laid off and whose programs are being shut down. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, the Secretary of State Marco Rubio has tapped the Director of Foreign Assistance [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  at State Department, Pete Morocco, to review the agency's work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=254.44s)]
*  There were reports that he was at the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  He was not charged, though. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=261.88s)]
*  We've requested comment, but what is your reaction to that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=264.0s)]
*  Look, I don't know Peter Morocco, but what I am hearing is that he's in charge of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=267.96s)]
*  waiver process that Secretary Rubio set up to allow organizations to come in and appeal [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=273.68s)]
*  and say that their work is urgent and humanitarian or critical to American security. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  And while waivers have been signed, money is not flowing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=285.04s)]
*  And that's why so many local partners are being laid off and vital programs shut down. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=288.42s)]
*  It is alarming, if true, that Mr. Morocco was part of the January 6th riot in the Capitol, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  but frankly not out of keeping with an administration that has pardoned hundreds of folks who were [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=300.32s)]
*  convicted of assaulting police officers in our Capitol. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=305.76s)]
*  Do you worry about a brain drain at CIA with a buyout offer by the Musk people to, through [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=310.8s)]
*  communicating through the leadership, the new leadership at CIA, a buyout offer for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=317.28s)]
*  the entire workforce? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=322.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=323.76s)]
*  An oddly worded email offering a buyout, a fork in the road email, was sent to most [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=325.08s)]
*  of the civilian workforce of the U.S. government. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=330.52s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  And the CIA has now extended that to their workforce, which I'll remind you includes [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=334.84s)]
*  people with critical national security, knowledge, and experience. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=339.46s)]
*  Just as we're losing a generation of knowledge, skill, and experience in foreign aid and our [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=344.06s)]
*  development professionals who've served us around the world, so too this buyout offer, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=348.32s)]
*  which I question whether it's even legal or appropriate, I think would weaken our critical [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=354.08s)]
*  intelligence community and our largest and in some ways most important part of the intelligence [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  community, the CIA. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=365.68s)]
*  I will be talking with Director Ratcliffe later today about exactly this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=367.2s)]
*  And what do you know about Russian propaganda trying to take advantage of all this, and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=371.52s)]
*  perhaps Chinese as well? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=374.88s)]
*  When we create an opening by withdrawing from the world, by this sort of chaotic leadership, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=377.28s)]
*  can our adversaries take advantage of it? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=383.64s)]
*  I heard reports earlier today that an AID program that's been shut down in Nepal, the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=386.24s)]
*  Chinese are already offering to come in and take it over and help the Nepalese in their [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=391.56s)]
*  moment of need. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=396.36s)]
*  I think that when we have disorder in our intelligence services, in the Department of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=397.56s)]
*  Defense, in some of our domestic agencies like SBA or education, or when there is an [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=402.28s)]
*  of the Treasury database that has information on every American, it both unsettles our democracy, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=408.6s)]
*  it causes concern to millions of Americans. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  My phones have been ringing off the hook, and I think, Andrea, the only appropriate [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=418.56s)]
*  response to several of these abrupt actions is litigation to get a temporary restraining [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=422.68s)]
*  order. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=428.68s)]
*  It worked last week on the domestic funding shutdown. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=429.68s)]
*  My hope is it will work going forward on some of the ways that the privacy of Americans [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=433.2s)]
*  have been compromised and that our national security is being put at risk. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODET6ivBMoI&t=437.71999999999997s)]
