# New Yorker Editor: Not Possible To Evacuate All US Allies From Afghanistan By Aug 31st
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI)
*  I think when this is over, the American people have a clear understanding of what I did, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=0.0s)]
*  why we did it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=7.36s)]
*  And but look, that's the job. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=8.36s)]
*  My job is to make judgments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=10.96s)]
*  My job is to make judgments no one else can or will make. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=12.96s)]
*  I made them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm convinced I'm absolutely correct in not deciding to send more young women and men [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  to war for a war that in fact is no longer warranted. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=22.64s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=26.2s)]
*  It is five o'clock in the East. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=27.2s)]
*  I'm Chris Jansing in for Nicole Wallace, the U.S. commander in chief, not backing down [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=28.88s)]
*  from his decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan as he and his administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  are beating back heavy criticism coming their way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Right now, the situation in Kabul remains volatile and at times violent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  From our NBC News reporting, a deadly firefight brought renewed chaos to Kabul Airport on [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Monday where thousands of Afghans were waiting to flee the country as the Taliban faced down [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  a nascent resistance movement in the north. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=58.58s)]
*  One Afghan soldier was killed and three others were injured in the fight between Afghan security [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=61.42s)]
*  forces and unknown attackers at the north gate of the airport, the German military said [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=66.02s)]
*  in a tweet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  According to the latest numbers from the White House, in just the last 24 hours, 16,000 individuals [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=72.78s)]
*  were evacuated and the administration's focus remains on maintaining that steady stream [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=78.74s)]
*  of removals. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=84.22s)]
*  But President Biden acknowledges there is still much more work ahead to get the rest [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=85.7s)]
*  of the Americans and our Afghan allies safe from Taliban rule. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=89.9s)]
*  With the August 31st deadline for withdrawal fast approaching, that's next Tuesday, Biden [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=94.64s)]
*  says he was considering extending evacuation efforts, but that was met with a swift and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=99.7s)]
*  stark warning from the Taliban, who told Sky News the 31st is a red line and there would [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=105.28s)]
*  be consequences if evacuations continued after that point. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=111.42s)]
*  Which means Biden's handling of the situation in the next days and weeks are critical. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=115.5s)]
*  As David Sanger writes in the New York Times, to rescue his focus on the vital strategy, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  Biden knows he must first rescue those Americans and Afghan allies, whatever it takes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=126.13999999999999s)]
*  One of his closest aides told me last week that his legacy on Afghanistan might be decided [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=131.5s)]
*  not on how he did in the past two weeks, but on how he does in the next two. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=136.66s)]
*  No matter how good his geopolitical strategy, if the on the ground execution does not improve, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=142.18s)]
*  the withdrawal will likely be remembered as a disaster. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=147.66s)]
*  Those who have been lucky enough to escape already are thankful, but also filled with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=151.62s)]
*  despair. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=155.94s)]
*  This from a report in the New York Times where they spoke with a lecturer at Kabul University [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=157.58s)]
*  who managed to flee a few days before the collapse of the city. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  Quote, now he said he was overcome by the sense of becoming a permanent refugee. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=166.18s)]
*  We have no home to return to, he said. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=172.16s)]
*  The day since Kabul's collapse have felt more like centuries, he added. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=174.88s)]
*  A friend left in Kabul where many people have remained cloistered inside for fear of Taliban [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=179.16s)]
*  retribution described it to him as a city of ghosts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Even during the light of the day, you feel like it's dark. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=189.0s)]
*  That kind of depression is governing the city, he said. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=192.24s)]
*  People fear that the international community has given up on Afghanistan and they will [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=195.76s)]
*  one day recognize this regime change in the country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=200.56s)]
*  And that's where we begin this hour. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=205.4s)]
*  Joining us now David Rode, executive editor for the New Yorker. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=207.32s)]
*  Also with us, NBC News correspondent at the Pentagon, Courtney Qubee, and Marc Jacobson, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=210.88s)]
*  a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan in 2006. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=215.72s)]
*  He also served in Kabul as a deputy NATO representative and was a senior advisor to defense secretary [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=219.66s)]
*  Ash Carter. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=225.84s)]
*  Good to see all of you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=227.12s)]
*  David, I want to start with some good news if I can because we've been talking over the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=228.24s)]
*  course of many several days about friends you had in Kabul. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=232.08s)]
*  You were trying desperately to see what you could do to help get them out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=236.44s)]
*  Tell us where they are now, what you know about how they are and how are you feeling? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  So we're talking about an Afghan journalist named Tahir Luddin. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  He and I were kidnapped by the Taliban more than a decade ago and I'm alive today because [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=251.4s)]
*  Tahir helped me escape from Taliban captivity. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=255.8s)]
*  He is now a U.S. citizen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  He lives in the Washington, D.C. area. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=260.48s)]
*  He was trying to bring his family to the United States before President Biden announced the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=263.08s)]
*  withdrawal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=268.48s)]
*  The visa process was very slow and his family was trapped in Kabul. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=269.48s)]
*  It's been a desperate effort by Tahir. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=274.32s)]
*  I'm trying to help him to get them out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=276.2s)]
*  They are out. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  They managed to get on the airport. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=279.3s)]
*  I don't want to say how. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=280.56s)]
*  It was a miracle. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  After many hours of waiting, some of them without food and water in the American zone [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=283.72s)]
*  there, they boarded an American military flight so they are safe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  We're elated. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=291.88000000000005s)]
*  Tahir just called me. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=293.88000000000005s)]
*  He hasn't heard from them in 14 hours. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't know where they are, but at least they are safe. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  I can't even imagine what a sigh of relief you must feel, but what about for the folks [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=300.24s)]
*  who are still there, David? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we've got eight days to go until the August 31st deadline. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=306.8s)]
*  A conservative estimate of the number of Afghan civilians who back the U.S. effort, this would [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=311.72s)]
*  be military translators, people who built schools for girls, hospitals, Afghan journalists [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=316.6s)]
*  who worked with people like me. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=322.48s)]
*  That could be at least 100,000. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=325.08s)]
*  Another estimate is 300,000. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=327.7s)]
*  We are not going to be able to remove 300,000 Afghan allies in eight days. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=329.94s)]
*  I think the timeline is unrealistic and needs to be extended. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=335.52s)]
*  Rich brings us, Mark, to the possibility of an extension. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=339.32s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=342.04s)]
*  What do you make of the Taliban threats? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=343.04s)]
*  You've seen this from so many different sides on the ground in Afghanistan. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=344.88s)]
*  What's your take on the situation right now? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=349.84s)]
*  First, let me talk about the extension. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=352.0s)]
*  The bottom line is American families right now, because of the policies that the State [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=355.08s)]
*  Department has set up and refuses to budge on, American families are being split up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Afghan families are going to get left behind. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=365.48s)]
*  And frankly, Afghans aren't getting into the gate in the numbers needed to get them out [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=367.44s)]
*  in time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  And what I mean by that is you have American families, U.S. passport holders, who might [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  have an Afghan adult child, sorry, Afghan adult family member, or they might have a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=378.0s)]
*  mother or father, people who are going to be given the right immigration status to come [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  to the United States and are being told they can't. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  I am aware of a family that went over from the United States to Afghanistan for a wedding. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=391.72s)]
*  You had some U.S. passport holders. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=396.48s)]
*  You had others who were on visas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=397.96s)]
*  The Afghan passport holders are still stuck there and can't get them out. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=400.32s)]
*  There is no way to do this with the current timeline, because don't forget, you have to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=404.12s)]
*  stop the airlift before the 31st because you have to bring military forces, retrograde [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  the military forces before that date. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=416.2s)]
*  So I don't know how he does it without extending the date. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=418.04s)]
*  And to the Taliban? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=420.56s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=421.56s)]
*  I mean, the bottom line is the White House keeps talking about the Pentagon keeps talking [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=422.56s)]
*  about this incredible military force. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=426.76s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=428.56s)]
*  If we have to leave American citizens on the ground because of a Taliban threat, then I'm [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=429.88s)]
*  not sure what this country stands for anymore. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=435.24s)]
*  So Courtney, what do we know about what the Biden administration, what the Pentagon is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=437.64s)]
*  willing to do, assuming that we have to go past this 31st deadline? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=442.28s)]
*  So, I mean, the military is absolutely capable of going beyond the August 31st deadline. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  But I'll be honest with you, Chris, I don't get the impression that that's the decision [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=454.44s)]
*  that's being made in this administration. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a policy decision. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  It's up to President Biden to make that decision. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  And if he were to direct the military, I am confident that they would move forward and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=464.76s)]
*  they would continue the evacuation effort. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=468.32s)]
*  But just from what I'm hearing from defense officials, it does not seem like that is that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=469.84s)]
*  they are planning for or that they are expecting that actually to happen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=475.76s)]
*  Of course, they could continue with this evacuation effort. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  And listening to David and listening to Mark, two people who know Afghanistan so well, I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  mean, we have such two excellent experts here and they know the situation of this evacuation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's exactly what we've been hearing from Afghanistan from here, that there are [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=493.9s)]
*  thousands of people who are in need, who need to get out. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  And getting them out by August 31st is highly unlikely to get everyone out who wants to. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  And Mark makes an excellent point, and that is there's 5,800 roughly U.S. troops there [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  in Kabul and there's still a small embassy element. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=513.0s)]
*  So you can't just flip a switch and get all of those people out as well. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=515.88s)]
*  The military needs to leave and that's going to take some time. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=520.64s)]
*  So then you have to backtrack from the August 31st deadline to say, how much time is it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=523.46s)]
*  going to take for the military to get out? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=528.24s)]
*  And that's when they're going to have to stop accepting evacuees to put them on flights [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=530.0s)]
*  as well. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=533.88s)]
*  Yeah, again, Biden said yesterday he may extend it, but I want you to listen to what National [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=534.88s)]
*  Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said today. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=539.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=541.76s)]
*  We are engaging with the Taliban, consulting with the Taliban on every aspect of what's [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=544.2s)]
*  happening in Kabul right now, on what's happening at the airport, on how we need to ensure that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=550.0s)]
*  there is facilitated passage to the airport for American citizens, SIVs, third country [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=556.26s)]
*  nationals and so forth. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=562.98s)]
*  We'll continue those conversations with them. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=564.16s)]
*  Ultimately, it will be the President's decision how this proceeds. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=566.22s)]
*  No one else's. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=569.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=570.7s)]
*  You said we have the wherewithal to get Americans out, but you didn't, forgive me if I didn't [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=571.7s)]
*  get the quote right in your statement, but you didn't say that we have the ability to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=578.06s)]
*  get them out. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=582.66s)]
*  You didn't say the timeframe by August 31st. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=583.66s)]
*  So, as I've said before, as the president has said before, we believe that we have time [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=587.1400000000001s)]
*  between now and the 31st to get out any American who wants to get out. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=591.94s)]
*  David, I want to get your reaction to that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=595.84s)]
*  Knowing what we know, I mean, we have women who are giving birth on the tarmac, who knew [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  that they were near the point where they were going to give birth and they fought to get [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=605.58s)]
*  on a plane anyway. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=609.5400000000001s)]
*  We know that there are civilians there who went there to fight for women's rights, women [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=610.74s)]
*  who are holed up in their homes trying to keep the lights out and not be detected. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=616.74s)]
*  The horror of the situation is so great. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=622.72s)]
*  And yet we're looking at eight days from now, that light switch clicking. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=625.6s)]
*  And look, the National Security Advisor said any American by the 31st, he didn't mention [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=631.76s)]
*  Afghans. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=636.5s)]
*  I had a family call me today. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  They have someone who worked at the American University of Kabul. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  That's his crime. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  He's being hunted by the Taliban. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  There will be public executions by the Taliban of Afghans who helped the American project [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=645.58s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  Does the administration want this? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=653.94s)]
*  Can't they extend this deadline beyond it? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=657.14s)]
*  I think there will be a political cost. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  You see the poll numbers dropping about how he's handling Afghanistan. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=660.48s)]
*  Terrible things will happen. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=664.7s)]
*  This airlift must be extended. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanwOvNlrYI&t=666.1s)]
