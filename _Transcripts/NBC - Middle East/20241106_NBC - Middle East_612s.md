# ‘Netanyahu is having the best day’: How the world is reacting to Trump’s victory
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE)
*  President-elect Donald Trump has laid out positions toward allies and adversaries that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=0.0s)]
*  depart sharply from U.S. foreign policy by most of his predecessors from both political [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=5.16s)]
*  parties, embracing Vladimir Putin and other dictators, Viktor Orban, around the world, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=10.46s)]
*  opposing the war in Ukraine, disavowing U.S. intelligence assessments and career diplomats. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=15.8s)]
*  And when he was in the Oval Office starting a trade war with China, some world leaders [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  are celebrating Trump's victory while others are trying to put on a brave face. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=26.1s)]
*  Joining the discussion now is NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Angle. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  Richard, there is a divide. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=35.1s)]
*  Europe, very worried. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=37.1s)]
*  The Persian Gulf leaders, MBS and others in Saudi Arabia and UAE are delighted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=39.06s)]
*  They have been very upset with Democrats ever since Barack Obama was in the White House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=45.0s)]
*  And they are very pleased with Donald Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=51.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's too many people sitting on the fence. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  You either love him or you hate him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=55.9s)]
*  And Netanyahu has embraced him and already called him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=57.82s)]
*  Netanyahu is having the best day probably in the last year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=59.82s)]
*  Netanyahu has made it quite clear that he wants a new vision for the Middle East. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=64.3s)]
*  He believes that Donald Trump is going to help take him there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=70.22s)]
*  It's a vision of the Middle East in which Iran is significantly diminished, maybe regime [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=74.02s)]
*  change in Iran, maybe attacking their oil facilities and energy facilities, which President [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  Biden had explicitly said no to. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=86.28s)]
*  We'll see about a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  But I don't know if you noticed a couple of days ago, Jared Kushner put out a tweet saying [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=91.8s)]
*  he doesn't support a ceasefire. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=95.84s)]
*  That now is a historic opportunity not to have a ceasefire and go back to the way things [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=98.08s)]
*  they were, but to transform the Middle East and enact this new vision of a Middle East [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=102.08s)]
*  with diminished Iran, diminished Hezbollah, diminished Hamas, a new kind of Middle East [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=107.84s)]
*  with the United States, President Trump and Netanyahu working in lockstep to get there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=112.68s)]
*  And Palestinian rights, which the Saudis paid lip service to at first and then more fully [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=118.2s)]
*  embraced because after the uproar over Gaza and the way Palestinian civilians were treated, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=124.56s)]
*  they had to as the price for normalization with Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  But certainly King Abdullah and Jordan and others and maybe even the Saudis. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=133.64s)]
*  King Abdullah has to because of the Palestinian population and him being next door to the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=139.0s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=143.56s)]
*  But Palestinian rights, particularly in Gaza, much less important. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=144.92s)]
*  And then Zelensky. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=149.32s)]
*  The pressure on Zelensky to negotiate with Ukraine, as we said just a few minutes ago, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=150.72s)]
*  Donald Trump said he could settle that war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=157.84s)]
*  I've been speaking to Ukrainians yesterday on Election Day and then today, the day after. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  We're now all here trying to figure out what this means. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=167.56s)]
*  And every country is trying to do the same thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=170.08s)]
*  Everyone was watching this story. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Everyone is now trying to figure out what the day after means. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  And you saw President Zelensky is one of the first people to come out and say, oh, thank [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=176.24s)]
*  you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=179.8s)]
*  We were on the same page that he embraces President Trump's vision for peace through [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=180.8s)]
*  strength. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=185.88s)]
*  He doesn't embrace President Trump's vision for what's going to happen in Ukraine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=186.88s)]
*  But he's trying to curry some favor because his future, Ukraine's future, the war's future, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=191.04s)]
*  very much depends on ongoing U.S. military support. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  But there's also an irony here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=201.72s)]
*  The Biden policy wasn't particularly working well for Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=204.48s)]
*  What has been happening for the last couple of years in Ukraine has been the United States [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  has been sending Ukraine weapons, but not enough weapons to win, just enough weapons [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=213.84s)]
*  to keep the war going. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=218.16s)]
*  So many Ukrainians have actually come to the conclusion that they probably can't take back [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=220.04s)]
*  militarily alone that part of eastern Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=224.8s)]
*  They can't take back Crimea with military means alone. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=228.94s)]
*  Zelensky, diplomatically, politically for his own politics, can't really sign a peace deal [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=232.36s)]
*  giving away all of this territory to Russia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=239.32s)]
*  So forcing him into an agreement might not be totally, totally unpopular among all Ukrainians. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=242.68s)]
*  Trump can veto, any member can, NATO admission for Ukraine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=252.6s)]
*  Then there's NATO. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=256.92s)]
*  Where Ukraine was and what Ukraine was hoping to be two days ago is not where Ukraine is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=259.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=264.72s)]
*  Ukraine has to try and figure out, based on what I'm reading, reading the tea leaves, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=265.92s)]
*  how to live in this new reality where the military funding is going to get cut, where [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=271.92s)]
*  they're going to be forced to the negotiating table. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=275.72s)]
*  Can they spin this into a positive? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=277.92s)]
*  Can they say, okay, the war as we were fighting it was costing us a lot of soldiers, costing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=280.2s)]
*  us a lot of injuries, costing us a lot of money, made us totally dependent on the whims [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  of American politics, which is not necessarily a position that any country wants to be in. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=290.5s)]
*  Can they spin this into some sort of positive where they have a ceasefire, get an aid package, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=295.96s)]
*  try and transform their country? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=302.64s)]
*  But it is not the vision of a victorious Ukraine that has been sold to the Ukrainian people [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=304.08s)]
*  for the last three years or so, or sold to NATO. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=310.96s)]
*  And there's a larger NATO question, right, about whether even Donald Trump, who in his [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  first foreign trip made it clear he wasn't so crazy about the organization, he has pushed [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=319.78s)]
*  it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=324.24s)]
*  He has got his big strengths that he got people, the other countries, to ante up more. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=325.24s)]
*  What happens to NATO under the second term? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you could make the argument that NATO is basically a dead letter at this point. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  He did try to get out in his first term. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=335.48s)]
*  It was people like John Kelly and John Bolton who stopped him at that point. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=337.32s)]
*  But he has said since then repeatedly that Russia can do whatever it wants. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=341.6s)]
*  That's his phrase, with any NATO ally who doesn't pay up, as he puts it, enough to spend [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=345.64s)]
*  on his own military. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=350.18s)]
*  Well, that means Article 5 doesn't mean anything. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=351.18s)]
*  Article 5 says all NATO members come to the defense of the other NATO members if attacked [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=353.74s)]
*  in effect. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=358.22s)]
*  That's a mutual defense assurance. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=359.22s)]
*  If you don't have that as an inviolable provision of the NATO charter, it is meaningless. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=360.26s)]
*  What adversary takes it seriously now that Donald Trump is coming back in saying, I don't [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=364.86s)]
*  really care about Lithuania. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=369.38s)]
*  You want to do something with Lithuania? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=370.94s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=371.94s)]
*  Even though Lithuania, by the way, does spend quite a lot on its own defense. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=372.94s)]
*  He was in office, we wrote in our book, that he was told how NATO works. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=375.5s)]
*  He says, you mean I have to go to war if Russia attacks Lithuania? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes, sir, you do. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=381.98s)]
*  Well, that's crazy, he said. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=383.06s)]
*  Now, if he doesn't believe in NATO and has made it clear he doesn't believe in NATO, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  then NATO has a real problem. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=388.66s)]
*  So what are the consequences of this? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=389.66s)]
*  So as we're talking, I'm thinking American foreign policy for generations was defined [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  as John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=399.74s)]
*  We will support any friend, oppose any default for the survival and defense of liberty. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, Trump's foreign policy seems to be, we're all chumps here in the U.S., like a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=409.18s)]
*  landlord in a bad lease. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=417.18s)]
*  Why are we helping this country halfway across the world and not getting anything in return [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=418.74s)]
*  for it? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=423.26s)]
*  And I'm the master deal maker. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  Just put me in a room with these two guys and I can make a deal. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=425.9s)]
*  And then the whole thing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=428.58s)]
*  That's now what American foreign policy, I think, is what it is. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=429.58s)]
*  It's worth remembering, by the way, Trump didn't just say that he can solve the war [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=432.38s)]
*  in 24 hours, which he did. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  He said he will do that before the inauguration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=437.02s)]
*  So in the next 76 days at some point, I guess it should be today. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=439.9s)]
*  It could be, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  It should be. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  It's 24 hours. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=444.85999999999996s)]
*  But if he doesn't believe, he doesn't believe in NATO, he doesn't appreciate what it's [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=445.85999999999996s)]
*  done. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=449.18s)]
*  NATO was set up just so everybody understands after World War II and it is established and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=450.18s)]
*  codified American dominance over the world, particularly over Europe since then. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=455.34s)]
*  If you don't see a value in that entity that has given American power such preeminence, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=460.96s)]
*  then you don't see the world. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=467.56s)]
*  He misstates the fact that the Europeans have contributed so much to it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=470.08s)]
*  Why do you think Putin hates it so much if it was totally valueless? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=474.56s)]
*  The only time it's been used, Article 5, was in our defense after 9-11. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=477.0s)]

*  and much more of their GDP than we are, especially from the Scandinavian countries. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=493.40000000000003s)]

*  to be a priority at all. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=507.58000000000004s)]
*  Iran should be concerned, I think, when you talk about what Netanyahu's vision is. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=510.68s)]
*  Saudi also in a good mood. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=517.16s)]
*  And the Baltic states are scared. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=519.32s)]
*  And the Baltic states are scared because of the NATO and because of the lack of concern [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=520.82s)]
*  about keeping the Ukraine war going. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=525.52s)]
*  Richard Engel, it's so good to have you here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=528.28s)]
*  It's a good chance to be able to say to you face-to-face how much we appreciate what you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=530.08s)]
*  do. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, you know why I'm here? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  This is the biggest story in the world bar none. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  Yesterday I spoke to a senior Middle Eastern royal, a prime minister, two European officials, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  a Ukrainian soldier. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=544.6s)]
*  The only thing they were talking about was this election. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  And all of them anticipated that Trump was going to win. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=550.02s)]

*  looking at all the different trees, it seemed pretty obvious. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=570.1800000000001s)]
*  You had a guy who'd survived two assassination attempts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=573.32s)]
*  He's been doing this for nine years. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=576.8s)]
*  He's got a big personality, a charismatic leader. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=578.64s)]
*  He has a machine behind him. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=580.8s)]
*  She came in in the last minute, wasn't a particularly strong vice president, wasn't a particularly [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=582.8s)]
*  strong campaigner, candidate. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=587.12s)]
*  It seemed obvious looking from the outside in. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URBnquFTAnE&t=589.7s)]
