Video Description: In 2022, the death of Mahsa Amini after being arrested by Iran’s morality police sparked a movement. Many women took to the streets to protest and even flouted the country’s strict Islamic dress code. The response was so large that the morality police largely pulled back. It made a difference – at least for a little while. Two years later, however, the morality police are cracking down once again.
