# White House: Strike on Houthis are not related to strikes in Iraq and Syria
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE)
*  Ali, we've been talking to some of our sources, and I understand from a senior administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=0.0s)]
*  official that the strikes that we're seeing in Yemen today are not related to the strike [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=4.7s)]
*  that we saw yesterday in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=10.18s)]
*  We've been told that the action today was unrelated to that and that this strike, these [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  strikes today are in direct response to actions taken by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=19.14s)]
*  and a part of the continued effort that we've seen over the last weeks and months really [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=26.38s)]
*  to degrade the Houthis' ability to strike these vessels that are transiting the Red [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=30.98s)]
*  Sea. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=36.5s)]
*  Obviously, as you look at the bigger picture here, there's an effort to reach all of these [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=37.5s)]
*  entities that have been lashing out, if you will. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=45.22s)]
*  We know that there have been strikes in Syria and Iran against facilities that house American [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=48.46s)]
*  troops over the last several months, and as a result of that, the U.S. has had smaller [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=54.72s)]
*  strikes that we've seen to try to stop some of these attacks, to say to these smaller [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=60.12s)]
*  militia groups that the United States will not stand for attacks that impact and in several [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=65.36s)]
*  cases hurt American troops. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=70.08s)]
*  And then, of course, after the attack that killed three American soldiers last weekend, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=72.72s)]
*  we saw the response yesterday that included 85 targets across seven sites in Iraq and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=77.56s)]
*  Syria. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=84.66s)]
*  Now, today, we understand that it is separate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=85.66s)]
*  The action we're seeing today is separate and apart from the action we saw yesterday [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=88.56s)]
*  that was the first step in a multi-tiered response to the attack in Jordan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=92.5s)]
*  But today, the attack on these sites in Yemen that are controlled by the Houthis are separate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=97.44s)]
*  from what we saw yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=104.72s)]
*  Still a major impact, obviously, on the Houthis' capability to execute some of the strikes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=106.72s)]
*  that they've been executing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=113.84s)]
*  Now, the third time that we've seen the U.S. and a coalition of other countries take action [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=115.2s)]
*  in the last couple of weeks against the Houthis trying to diminish their ability to strike [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=122.2s)]
*  out against commercial vessels and military vessels in the Red Sea Alley. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=127.48s)]
*  Aaron, thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=132.08s)]
*  Stand by. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=133.28s)]
*  We're going to continue our coverage of these new attacks in Yemen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Qm6cHzmwE&t=134.28s)]
