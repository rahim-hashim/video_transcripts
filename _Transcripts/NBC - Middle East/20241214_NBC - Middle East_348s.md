# ‘Need to keep pressure’ on ISIS: Middle East expert says Trump should keep U.S. involved in Syria
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40)
*  And joining me right now, we have Dana Stroll, research director for the Washington Institute [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=0.0s)]
*  for Near East Policy and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. Dana, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=4.24s)]
*  welcome. So, we know that the U.S. has been looking for information on the missing American [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Austin Tice. How does the State Department go about gathering any leads amid the fall of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Assad regime? Because there's got to be a level of chaos going on there, right? Does it reach out to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=20.8s)]
*  rebel leaders? Is it up to our intelligence community? Where do they start? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=26.48s)]
*  Dana Stroll Thanks so much for that question, Alex. I mean, what's so heartbreaking about the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=30.32s)]
*  story is that Austin Tice's family has repeatedly gone public this week and talked about firm, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  credible evidence that they believe he's still alive. And in that very press conference with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=42.64s)]
*  Secretary Blinken today, what he said was that entities within the U.S. government are talking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=47.6s)]
*  to HDTS, that rebel group that's in charge of Syria right now, in order to locate Austin Tice. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=53.36s)]
*  They even sent a representative from the State Department to Lebanon to actually try to coordinate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=60.16s)]
*  So, I think there's both intelligence agency communication and diplomatic negotiation to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=65.44s)]
*  locate Austin, which just shows you how committed the administration is to finding him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=71.2s)]
*  SONIA DARA I was going to say that's definitely clearly a priority. So, the Biden administration [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=75.2s)]
*  used the chaos during the Assad regime's last hours to strike ISIS targets. Will the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=79.84s)]
*  administration and the incoming Trump administration, will they work with a new Syrian government to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  keep suppressing ISIS, or do you think the U.S. will keep acting on its own discretion? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=92.0s)]
*  Dana Stroll Well, right now, U.S. forces, there's about 900 in Syria working with a entity called [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are predominantly Syrian Kurds, but also Arabs, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=103.2s)]
*  and they're there to both continue doing military strikes against ISIS, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=108.0s)]
*  but also the SDF, the Syrian Democratic Forces, are maintaining custody of 9,000 ISIS fighters [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=112.48s)]
*  who are still in detention and also displaced persons cancers, 40,000 women and children who [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=119.44s)]
*  still would like to go home. And until the world has a solution to those two groups of people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=124.8s)]
*  the enduring defeat of ISIS isn't achieved. President Trump has talked about the U.S. having [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=130.32s)]
*  no role in this fight and getting out, but I think what we've seen at this point is that what [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=135.52s)]
*  happens in Syria doesn't stay in Syria, and so we need to continue to keep pressure on this terrorist [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  group. And Matt Bradley touched on this, but officials are mulling over lifting the terror [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=146.4s)]
*  designation from the Syrian rebel group HDS and the $10 million bounty from its leader, Al Jelani. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=152.4s)]
*  What are the challenges establishing a working relationship? Can there be trust between [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=160.48s)]
*  both parties this early? I mean, Al Jelani is saying positive things, but is that enough to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=165.6s)]
*  start talks? And last question, I'm throwing a lot at you. Would Trump restore the terrorist [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=172.16s)]
*  designation potentially once in office? So I think at this point, everyone, the assessment is that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=177.44s)]
*  HDS and its leader Al Jelani is saying the right things about governing in a way that's reflective [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=185.28s)]
*  of the will of all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity, religion, sex, geography, et cetera. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=191.2s)]
*  And Secretary Blinken actually laid out criteria that the U.S. is looking at in order to move [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=197.76s)]
*  forward with HDS, which again is that inclusive governance, continuity in services, making sure [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=202.64s)]
*  that Syria doesn't become a base for Al Qaeda or other global jihadist groups to export terror and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=208.8s)]
*  planned terrorist attacks and also the security of that chemical weapons stockpile from Assad [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=214.56s)]
*  that we still haven't completed that mission. I think it's also important to remember there's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=219.36s)]
*  U.S. terrorist designations, but there's also United Nations terrorist designations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=224.08s)]
*  So this isn't something that one country can decide to do on its own. It's the entire security [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=228.72s)]
*  council. And that's going to take some time. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that last point. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=233.12s)]
*  I do want to turn to the drone sightings here at home because the reports indicate [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=238.24s)]
*  numerous sightings in Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=242.24s)]
*  House Speaker Johnson was given a classified briefing as state and Capitol Hill officials [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=246.08s)]
*  are calling for transparency. The White House has downplayed the sightings, saying DHS, FBI, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=250.24s)]
*  state and local law enforcement have not corroborated the sightings and don't believe [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=256.56s)]
*  they pose a threat. And yet, is there something we don't know publicly which Speaker Johnson [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  may have learned in his briefing? But from what you know, what's your assessment here? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=268.0s)]
*  Anything to be concerned about? Well, I certainly can't speak to what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=273.6s)]
*  happens in classified briefings. I think what's important here is that if the American people [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=277.92s)]
*  are concerned, then the U.S. government needs to be concerned and they're investigating it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=282.64s)]
*  But when it comes to different aerial phenomena that are flying around U.S. military bases, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=287.28s)]
*  whether in the United States or in the Middle East, that base commander has all the authority [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=293.68s)]
*  he or she needs to shoot it down if it's believed to be a threat. And that's what we do in the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=298.96s)]
*  Middle East. And I think part of what's happening in the United States is that around these critical [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=304.24s)]
*  installations, it's not yet deemed to be an imminent threat. And so the administration's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=309.12s)]
*  not at the point of taking military action. They want to be methodical about it and make sure they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=314.32s)]
*  know what they're dealing with. And also were they to shoot it down, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=318.88s)]
*  it might injure people on the ground. They've got to be careful with that too, Dana. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=322.24s)]
*  All right, Dana Stroll, it's good to see you. Thank you so much. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRtt1aN-40&t=325.84000000000003s)]
