# ‘No such thing as total victory’: Fmr. Middle East Advisor reflects on ceasefire and hostage deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g)
*  But welcoming now to the conversation, we have former U.S. Ambassador to Morocco, our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=0.0s)]
*  friend Mark Ginsburg. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Mark is also the senior global adviser for the Counter-Extremism Project. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  His nephew, I'm sorry to say, a member of the IDF, was killed on October 7th. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=10.26s)]
*  So, Mark, you have to be thinking about your nephew. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=14.64s)]
*  As we just saw a short time ago, these first images of the Israeli hostages after their [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=17.88s)]
*  release, we understand your nephew was killed on October 7th. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=22.86s)]
*  He was a SEAL, a special forces leader in the IDF. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=28.0s)]
*  You know, what goes through your mind when you see this and what could have been for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=33.16s)]
*  your nephew? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=37.28s)]
*  My nephew very much and my nephew, Eli, may have been trying to rescue these very three [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=40.4s)]
*  women when he was killed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=46.36s)]
*  I don't know that, but given the sacrifice that he made with those around him who dashed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=48.68s)]
*  as quickly as they could on their own without orders to try to rescue these hostages and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  to know that he sacrificed his life for their behalf, look, I'm so happy and I'm sure my [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=63.16s)]
*  family in Israel is happy that this truce has been reached and that the hostages, at [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=70.18s)]
*  least those who are alive, will be able to return to perhaps some sense of normalcy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=79.18s)]
*  But I have no illusions, Alex, about what may happen after this phase one is finished. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=85.48s)]
*  Just the fact that you saw all of these Hamas fighters surrounding those cars is an indication [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=93.4s)]
*  how little in the end the Israelis have accomplished in destroying Hamas' willingness to continue [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=100.08s)]
*  fighting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=106.56s)]
*  Does that then worry you in preempt phase two and three and bring about an end to this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=108.28s)]
*  war? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=114.64s)]
*  I don't see, Alex, given my own knowledge of Gaza and I visited there and met with Hamas, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=116.88s)]
*  the fact that after 471 days of pulverizing attacks, there are still thousands of Hamas [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  fighters who are still willing to stand up and to either fight Israel's smore, fire missiles [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=133.48s)]
*  into Israel, and just the other day, just last night, Alex, there was an air raid siren [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=142.2s)]
*  going off in southern Israel because Hamas and maybe some of its collateral supporting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=147.72s)]
*  terrorist organizations decided to fire back rockets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  There's no such thing as total victory. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=160.32s)]
*  Netanyahu is feeding a big lie to the Israeli people because Hamas is not going to pack [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  up and leave and go sun themselves on the Riviera. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=169.56s)]
*  Is there something that runs through your mind, given your experience as an ambassador [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=174.8s)]
*  and your studying of this region of the world? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=179.2s)]
*  Is there something that comes to mind you think this could be a hiccup from which we [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=181.68s)]
*  are not able to go forward, that it could cause all of this and this agreement to fall [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  apart? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=190.0s)]
*  Do certain things press on you that way? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=191.44s)]
*  Look, I'm hopeful that the peacemakers, and I include President Biden, President-elect [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=193.44s)]
*  Trump in this, because without either of them, this hostage deal and this ceasefire would [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=199.8s)]
*  not be achieved. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=205.32s)]
*  The fact remains is that Hamas may try to replicate what has taken place by Hezbollah [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=207.0s)]
*  and Lebanon, infiltrate and integrate itself and remain a presence while letting the Palestinian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=212.4s)]
*  Authority and under phase two come in and in effect take over the enormous agonizing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=218.76s)]
*  responsibility for reconstructing Gaza. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=225.64s)]
*  And so Hamas doesn't want to be responsible for the turmoil and carnage they created among [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  They'd be more than happy to set back and benefit from raking off whatever profits they [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=237.0s)]
*  can make from reconstruction and let the Palestinian Authority take over. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=243.2s)]
*  That could bring about some semblance of peace. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=248.46s)]
*  That's my best expectation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=251.5s)]
*  With your history as a diplomat, as an ambassador, you know all about negotiation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=254.22s)]
*  So give me a sense of what changes when you're negotiating something as sensitive as what [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=258.74s)]
*  has been negotiated in the Middle East, when you have a group of players, if you will, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=264.62s)]
*  who've gotten to know each other, develop some level of trust, you're going to assume, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=269.38s)]
*  seeing happen today, and they get replaced with a new slate of negotiators. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=274.74s)]
*  How long does it take to build that kind of trust with them to think when you say something, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  you're going to mean it and we're going to trust you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=286.86s)]
*  Well, here's a perfect illustration. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=289.18s)]
*  The president's special envoy for hostage negotiations, Roger Carstens, who deserves [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=291.82s)]
*  his own Medal of Freedom for the work that he has undertaken during the Biden administration [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=297.54s)]
*  to achieve hostage releases around the world. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  He was indispensable in this process. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=306.3s)]
*  I don't know whether the Trump administration is going to keep him on. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=309.94s)]
*  He's apolitical. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=313.86s)]
*  The fact that Mr. Witkoff was permitted to participate by President-elect Trump with [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=316.06s)]
*  the Biden team in reaching this agreement, that was a great baton handoff. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  Kudos to President-elect Trump for this, and kudos also to the fact that the team that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=330.3s)]
*  President Biden assembled have been willing to work across the aisle as well. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't see that happening in a lot of Alex, but in this instance, the fact that they both [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=342.62s)]
*  work together forced Mr. Netanyahu's hand. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=347.3s)]
*  I don't think this would have happened without joint efforts to strongarm Netanyahu into [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=350.9s)]
*  making this deal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kByco_kVo7g&t=356.9s)]
