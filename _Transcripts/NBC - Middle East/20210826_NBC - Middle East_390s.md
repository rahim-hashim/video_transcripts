# Who Is ISIS-K And How Did The U.S. Know To Expect Their Attack?
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM)
*  Joining us now is counterintelligence analyst Leith Al-Khouri, who studies these things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=0.0s)]
*  intensively. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Al-Khouri, thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=4.8s)]
*  It's been a long time since we've seen you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's always bad news whenever you're going to be here to talk about one of these things, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=9.08s)]
*  but I appreciate you making the time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=12.36s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=15.0s)]
*  Tell me about what you make of U.S. officials warning the public, warning explicitly over [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=17.68s)]
*  days that an ISIS K attack, ISIS Khorasan attack at the airport targeting U.S. personnel, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=25.22s)]
*  targeting civilians, just like we saw today, that it was not only a threat, but that it [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=31.78s)]
*  was a severe threat and an increasingly likely one. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=36.62s)]
*  Look, ISIS has demonstrated over and again that it's masterfully opportunistic, especially [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=40.22s)]
*  when it comes to vacuums of power. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=49.22s)]
*  In fact, some of the chatter that I had been looking at just before the attack talked about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=52.42s)]
*  how ISIS was poised to launch attacks specifically because two of its enemies are out of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  picture. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  That is the Afghan security forces and, of course, the U.S. troops. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=64.9s)]
*  Now that they are out of the picture, they only have one more enemy left, and this enemy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=69.26s)]
*  is extremely busy right now trying to control Afghanistan all over again, trying to put [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=73.42s)]
*  logistics in place. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=80.02s)]
*  But the other point is that as ISIS is taking advantage of this power vacuum, it also realizes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=82.74s)]
*  that it can attract fighters from the ranks of the Taliban by showcasing the group as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  weak, as unable to govern, as also a group that is nationalistic and sitting at the negotiations [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  table with the West, sitting at the negotiations table with tyrants in the region, aka having [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=105.46s)]
*  a political office in Qatar. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=111.33999999999999s)]
*  So ISIS has mastered this technique before, and we are seeing it unfold again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  The last point I would say is that ISIS has been operating in Afghanistan for over six [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=120.74s)]
*  years now, and this is a lot of time for it to recruit fighters, to garner weapon and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  galvanized support. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=133.38s)]
*  And it has launched some of the most deadly attacks we have witnessed in Afghanistan, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=134.38s)]
*  whether at a maternity ward, at a hospital, whether at funerals, whether at places of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=141.22s)]
*  worship. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=146.38s)]
*  So this comes absolutely as no surprise that there had been warnings, and unfortunately [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=147.74s)]
*  these attacks actualized. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=154.78s)]
*  Lathar, ISIS and the Taliban going to go to war in Afghanistan? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=157.78s)]
*  This ISIS affiliate, is it strong enough, motivated enough and resourced enough that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=163.74s)]
*  they can challenge the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=168.82s)]
*  I think that from a distance we tend to lump these groups together. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=173.5s)]
*  They are enemies. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=177.1s)]
*  What's their conflict going to look like? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=178.1s)]
*  ISIS will absolutely butt heads with the Taliban. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=182.98s)]
*  It has been doing so. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=185.7s)]
*  In fact, over the past five years, it's been conducting regular assassinations against [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=187.14s)]
*  Taliban commanders, as well as foot soldiers in a range of places, not only where ISIS [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=192.06s)]
*  is concentrated today in Afghanistan, which is in the East, in the Nangarhar province, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=198.1s)]
*  but also it has targeted them in places like Kandahar, in places like Kabul, and other [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=202.94s)]
*  provinces of Afghanistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=208.5s)]
*  So ISIS has already been doing that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=210.66s)]
*  What has been keeping it at bay mostly are the Afghan commandos and the US forces. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=213.38s)]
*  Now that they are not in the picture or the calculation, ISIS will undoubtedly launch [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=218.78s)]
*  more strategic attacks targeting painful spots for the Taliban. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=224.22s)]
*  That will include some of the infrastructure that the Taliban needs to govern. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=230.74s)]
*  Of course, Kabul airport is case in point. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=236.54s)]
*  Last question for you, Leif. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  As President Biden threatens in no uncertain terms today, that the people who carried out [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=242.98s)]
*  this bombing will pay, that they'll be hunted down and they will pay, is it possible that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=247.22s)]
*  the Taliban is going to help the US in targeting ISIS if the US decides to launch some sort [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=253.22s)]
*  of either assassination of the leadership effort or assassination effort targeting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=258.94s)]
*  their leadership or some other major violent counterterrorism offensive here? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=263.18s)]
*  Is this something where the Taliban and the US actually have common cause to make? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=268.22s)]
*  There is certainly common cause. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=273.26000000000005s)]
*  I don't see the Taliban and the US forces having some sort of joint operations together, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=274.98s)]
*  but I do believe that the Taliban is going to put extra resources to target ISIS specifically [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=281.3s)]
*  in the east of the country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=287.74s)]
*  And that goes for the Taliban to showcase that it's capable actually of acting as a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=289.82000000000005s)]
*  de facto governing body in Afghanistan that a ragtag terrorist group is not going to do [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=296.06s)]
*  the work that empires like the British Empire, the Soviets, and of course, the Americans [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=303.34s)]
*  were not able to accomplish. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=307.9s)]
*  So it's going to put extra resources to showcase its strength to potentially try to uproot [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=309.3s)]
*  ISIS from Afghanistan. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=315.02s)]
*  I don't think though the US and the Taliban will be communicating on the results of those [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=318.02s)]
*  countermeasures to target ISIS. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=325.46s)]
*  I do believe that the US is going to use air power as much as possible in addition to, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  you know, eavesdropping on communication at large. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=334.94s)]
*  But I think the Taliban are going to rely on human sources to bring them the intelligence [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=338.06s)]
*  in order for them to know the locations of the ISIS cells and target them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=344.02s)]
*  Layth Al-Khuri, counterintelligence analyst and advisor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=351.14s)]
*  Layth, thank you for taking the time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=353.85999999999996s)]
*  It's good to have you back. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=355.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=356.26s)]
*  Thanks so much, Rachel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=357.26s)]
*  They say, you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=358.26s)]
*  In this case, the enemy of my enemy is an enemy and it's a whole world full of enemies [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=361.46s)]
*  in this case. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=366.58s)]
*  Just an absolutely terrible day in Afghanistan. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aJNxaooJM&t=367.58s)]
