# What comes next? Questions mounting over Hamas’ next move after Sinwar’s death
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds)
*  Let me turn to John Brennan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=0.0s)]
*  So you know this area so well, and as the former CIA director, you've studied Hamas [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  and as, of course, the Homeland Security, National Security deputy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=6.92s)]
*  Hamas is looking for a successor now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=11.32s)]
*  Would it be Mohammed Simmar, his brother? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=13.92s)]
*  Would it be one of the, perhaps, it's hard to say less radicalized, but one of the Hamas [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=17.28s)]
*  leaders living outside in Qatar or someplace else who would be easier to reach for negotiations? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=24.36s)]
*  Well, I think it's a question that Hamas leaders are grappling with right now because Simmar [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=29.92s)]
*  was not just the head of Gaza's military operations capabilities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=37.56s)]
*  He also assumed the leadership of Hamas's political bureau after Israel assassinated [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=41.44s)]
*  Ismail Kaniya in Tehran in July. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=46.64s)]
*  So he really had full control over the organization. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=49.84s)]
*  And so his younger brother, Mohammed, as well as Simmar's deputy, Khalil al-Hayyih, they're [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  the ones who are pursuing the very militant route that Yahya had led. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=57.6s)]
*  And so it's likely that one of them is going to take the lead inside of Gaza as far as [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  continuing to confront the Israeli troops that are there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=71.88s)]
*  But there is a question about whether or not there's going to be someone who will assume [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=76.04s)]
*  the mantle of leadership of the political bureau. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=79.56s)]
*  And there are some individuals. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=83.12s)]
*  Khalil Mishal, who is one of the founders of Hamas and was formerly head of the political [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=84.12s)]
*  bureau, he could be tapped to run that political aspect of the organization. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=89.44s)]
*  And so I do think the killing of Sinwar is certainly a body blow, a major blow to Hamas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  And I think they're going to have to struggle for a while to see whether or not they can [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  maintain any type of coherent organizational structure that will take guidance and direction [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  from leadership. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=110.92s)]
*  And I think this is one of the things that the Israelis are looking very carefully at [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  right now to figure out who is in charge, if anybody is in charge of Hamas, and how [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  they're going to now pursue their strategy and possibly including negotiations for the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=121.2s)]
*  release of the hostages if there is, as they say in their statement, a ceasefire. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=128.66s)]
*  And they're conditioning it on the withdrawal of Israeli troops as well from Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  And let me just also ask you about the hostages, because some of the families, and we will [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=138.8s)]
*  speak to the father of one of them later, are really concerned that there could be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=142.08s)]
*  retaliation now, that the remaining Hamas terrorists could take it out on the American [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=146.96s)]
*  hostages and the others. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, well, there's supposed to be a hundred hostages that hopefully are still alive, and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  they're probably distributed in different parts of Gaza in these tunnels, and they're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  under the control of individual Hamas unit commanders. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  And it's a question of whether or not any of those commanders are going to take action [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=169.32s)]
*  into their own hands and avenge the death of Sinwar. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=173.32s)]
*  And again, this is a question of who is it who is in control of Hamas and is going to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=177.56s)]
*  make some decisions about the fate of the hostages, and hopefully they're going to remain [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=182.72s)]
*  alive if there's going to be some effort on the part of the Israelis to try to ignite [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  again that could in fact lead to the release of these hostages, either in whole or in part. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=196.0s)]
*  And as we've been seeing pictures in hostage square in Tel Aviv where the families have [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=202.64s)]
*  been protesting, protests overnight again today, David Ignatius, you write that the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=208.44s)]
*  next steps could create a new generation of Sinwar. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=213.0s)]
*  What are you expecting also from Netanyahu? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=217.0s)]
*  He said the war continues. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=219.94s)]
*  That was his public speech. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=221.4s)]
*  The Americans are pressing him from the president on down, and the Secretary of State will be [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=223.6s)]
*  going as the president has ordered, to try to get him to see this as an opening, as a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=227.5s)]
*  potential to say you've done enough in Gaza. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Now focus on the hostages and try to get them out with a ceasefire of whatever duration. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=236.56s)]
*  So I think Prime Minister Netanyahu has to make a decision with the IDF leadership whether [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=244.84s)]
*  this is now the time to move toward an end of the war. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=251.56s)]
*  The president of Israel, Yitzhak Herzog, said today that he sees a significant window of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=256.36s)]
*  opportunity to move toward that ceasefire, but we don't know if Netanyahu agrees. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=262.44s)]
*  I think there are three problems both for the Israelis and for the United States as [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=267.64s)]
*  a mediator. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  First, who do you negotiate with? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  As Director Brennan made clear, the leadership of Hamas is uncertain. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=275.04s)]
*  Who do you do the deal with? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=281.8s)]
*  Before Sinwar was the key person, he had the ability to say yes and make a deal stick. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=283.36s)]
*  There's nobody like that left for the moment. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=289.48s)]
*  Second, what are the terms? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=292.0s)]
*  Biden administration negotiators have worked out elaborate terms for release of Palestinian [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=295.88s)]
*  prisoners held in Israeli prisons in exchange for the release of the hostages. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=301.88s)]
*  Those terms, the ones that are still on the table, are we starting all over again? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  Then finally, in some ways the most important, what comes next after the ceasefire deal? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=311.52s)]
*  You've got an utterly chaotic situation in Gaza, no clear plan for governance there, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=317.23999999999995s)]
*  and increasing chaos in Lebanon. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  So you could declare a ceasefire, but who maintains order? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=326.32s)]
*  I think all those issues really need to be addressed as we move, as President Biden says, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=330.28s)]
*  into this moment of opportunity for peace, but key questions that, so far as I can tell, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=335.88s)]
*  are not being addressed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=342.56s)]
*  And what was your read on Netanyahu's speech, David? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=344.56s)]
*  I thought his speech yesterday was understandably a note of personal and national triumph. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=350.4s)]
*  He has come back from the absolute bottom in terms of his political popularity and Israel's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=360.2s)]
*  national psyche and morale. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=367.12s)]
*  After October 7, Israel was really traumatized. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=369.92s)]
*  And I think he voiced the feeling that we, you know, Israelis, he personally have come [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=373.8s)]
*  this vast distance to be able to announce that the person who planned so carefully, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=379.24s)]
*  so deviously the attack on October 7 has been killed. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=385.56s)]
*  And so now clearly we're entering into a new phase. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=391.32s)]
*  All I want to say is that there are a lot of questions that surround just what happens next. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BRA0KLKds&t=394.12s)]
