# Rep. Auchincloss Reacts To GOP Criticism Of Biden's Handling Of Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ)
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Jake Ockenclus, who served in Afghanistan as a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Marine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=4.84s)]
*  Congressman, first of all, your reaction to the Republican leader's comments today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=5.84s)]
*  A lecture from the party of Donald Trump on prudence and foreign policy is hard to stomach. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=11.36s)]
*  This is a party that stood by while the former president tried to sell his office to the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=18.2s)]
*  Russians. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=25.0s)]
*  And I am not going to countenance a lecture or condescension from leader McCarthy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=26.38s)]
*  This president took office and had the integrity to make a hard and wrenching decision. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=31.7s)]
*  He told the American people the hard truth that we could not win a counterinsurgency [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=37.44s)]
*  without a political endgame. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=41.56s)]
*  We knew that withdrawal from a country whose moniker is the graveyard of empires was going [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=43.54s)]
*  to be hard. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=48.22s)]
*  But the military airlift is one of the most sophisticated operations in modern history. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=49.94s)]
*  We've gotten more than 100,000 people out of that country and we are going to wind down [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=55.98s)]
*  this evacuation and hand Afghanistan over to the Afghans. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  Tell me as one of the veterans, military veterans in Congress, your reaction to the bombing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=66.14s)]
*  We've lost 13 service members, mostly Marines, 18 others are injured. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=75.14s)]
*  How do you feel having served over there? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=82.2s)]
*  It's an atrocity and it's a tragedy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  The United States Marines are no better friend and no worse enemy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=88.28s)]
*  And our Afghan allies have seen the U.S. Marines as their friend in the last weeks, risking [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=92.36s)]
*  their lives to pull them into freedom. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  And ISIS-K is going to meet them as their enemy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=99.48s)]
*  Whether it takes 10 days or 10 years, we are going to hunt down the perpetrators of this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=102.2s)]
*  atrocity and we are going to kill them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=105.76s)]
*  I know that your previous correspondent was saying that counterterrorism operations are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=108.12s)]
*  more difficult and it's true that without troops on the ground, human intelligence is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=112.72s)]
*  degraded. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  But it's also true that our signals intelligence has gotten markedly better over the last 20 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=117.68s)]
*  years and that United States counterterrorism operations are sustained in dozens of countries [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  across the Middle East and North Africa where we don't have a military footprint but where [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=127.66s)]
*  we are able to neutralize both high level and foot soldier terrorists. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=131.24s)]
*  We will do the same with ISIS-K in Afghanistan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=135.6s)]
*  We know that the window is closing for people to get out, that busloads of Afghans, at risk [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=139.0s)]
*  Afghans are being told don't even bother to come to the airport anymore because of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=144.56s)]
*  increased security, the widened perimeter. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=149.92s)]
*  Are you confident that we can get all the Americans out by the deadline? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=154.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=159.88s)]
*  Every American who wants to leave will be able to get out before the deadline. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=161.2s)]
*  These evacuations are substantially advanced and they're now going to transition into diplomatic [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=164.72s)]
*  channels. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=169.44s)]
*  The United States still has leverage over the Taliban even when we complete our military [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=170.44s)]
*  withdrawal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=174.48s)]
*  90% of foreign reserves for Afghanistan are in U.S. banks, 75% of their government is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=175.48s)]
*  funded by international donors. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=180.44s)]
*  They need our assistance to competently run that country and certainly to be able to run [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=182.84s)]
*  that airport. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=188.16s)]
*  So we retain some leverage and we should use it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=189.4s)]
*  And we should also use it as part of our counterterrorism operations. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=192.24s)]
*  This sounds almost farcical to say, but ISIS-K thinks that the Taliban is too moderate and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=196.0s)]
*  ISIS-K really attacks the Taliban as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=201.88s)]
*  So the Taliban have a self-interest in seeing ISIS-K eradicated and may even be able to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  provide some humans to further that mission. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=209.24s)]
*  And you know, after having served and knowing what your fellow veterans feel, do you think [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=213.88s)]
*  this 20-year war effort was worth it? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=219.28s)]
*  The legacy of Afghanistan is too complicated for an up or down. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=223.6s)]
*  Literacy has doubled, infant mortality has halved, access to electricity has quadrupled. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=228.32s)]
*  There's 10 times as many kids in school in Afghanistan as there were 20 years ago, 40% [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=232.48s)]
*  of whom are girls. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Civil society in this country has made tremendous progress. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=237.92s)]
*  The Taliban are inheriting a different country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=240.32s)]
*  But should we have fought and sunk $2 trillion into a counterinsurgency that in situation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=243.48s)]
*  room after situation room, our national security officials knew could not be won without a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=249.32s)]
*  political endgame? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=253.6s)]
*  No, I don't think we should have. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=254.6s)]
*  And that's why my generation of leaders in Washington needs to hold to account every [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=256.24s)]
*  administration from Bush through, yes, Biden, for the execution of this war so that we can [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=260.68s)]
*  learn its lessons and prevent endless wars in the future. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=265.92s)]
*  Congressman Auchengloss, thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=270.12s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=271.52s)]
*  Thank you for being with us today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=272.56s)]
*  Thanks, Andrew. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48DIrfXyFSQ&t=273.56s)]
