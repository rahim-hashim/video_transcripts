# Biden Considers Extending Afghanistan Withdrawal Deadline By End Of August
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00)
*  Jacqueline, I want to start with you. This is, of course, one of the first big foreign policy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=0.0s)]
*  crises of this new presidency. Talk to me about the thinking inside of the Biden administration [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=3.92s)]
*  right now. I think that the Biden administration keeps looking at that whole, especially after [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=9.36s)]
*  this weekend, this most recent poll that NBC News just released about whether or not Americans [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=16.32s)]
*  approve or disapprove of the withdrawal from Afghanistan to begin with. That is the number [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  that they keep pointing to in the midst of all of this backlash when it comes to withdrawal. Of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=27.12s)]
*  course, Democrats who are even in favor of the withdrawal keep making the point criticizing the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=32.88s)]
*  administration not for the withdrawal itself but the chaos that has ensued. I think the weeks ahead, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=38.24s)]
*  leading up to August 31st, are going to be the biggest test for the administration. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=43.68s)]
*  The Pentagon has said that 16,000 people have been evacuated in the past 24 hours, but [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=49.52s)]
*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also just said that the U.S. is not quite sure how many [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=54.56s)]
*  Americans still actually are in the country because of various issues with paperwork. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=59.76s)]
*  The administration maintains that they're going to be able to evacuate those Americans and the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=67.44s)]
*  Americans that want to be evacuated before the 31st. Whether or not they can do that remains to be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=73.28s)]
*  seen. There's also growing global pressure. Biden is going to meet with a group of seven leaders on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=79.68s)]
*  Tuesday, and British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace has already said that Boris Johnson is going to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=85.2s)]
*  use this meeting to press Biden to extend that August 31st deadline to help our allies evacuate [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  people who still need to be evacuated from the country then. So I think all eyes right now are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  at the end of this month and whether the administration decides to stay in the country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Right, and this becomes, Eli, a question of confidence. The president was asked about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  Americans losing confidence in his ability to handle the situation in Afghanistan. I want to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=108.88s)]
*  play for you what he said. Take a listen. I had a basic decision to make. I either withdraw [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  America from a 20-year war that, depending on whose analysis you accept, cost us $150 million [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  a day for 20 years or $300 million a day for 20 years. Who, you know, I carry this card to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=130.56s)]
*  me every day and who, in fact, where we lost 2,448 Americans dead and 20,722 wounded. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=137.04s)]
*  Either increase the number of forces we keep, we keep there and keep that going or end the war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=150.32s)]
*  And I decided to end the war. So, Eli, you have the president there in very stark terms laying out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=157.76s)]
*  the stakes, but it does seem when you look at what the American public is saying, where they are, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=164.08s)]
*  it's not about ending the war. It's about how the exit is unfolding. I thought it was notable that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=168.72s)]
*  you had Sullivan in his comments today saying the decision about whether or not we extend that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  deadline on the 31st is going to be the president's and the president's alone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=179.68s)]
*  Right. He said that even though he also basically said right after the Taliban came out and said [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  that they don't want the U.S. in the country beyond the 31st, Sullivan said we probably don't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=190.4s)]
*  need to stay in the country beyond the 31st. So you can read that a number of different ways. But, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=196.32s)]
*  you know, it's been clear that since Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, the Biden administration and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=200.88s)]
*  the president himself have preferred to litigate the decision to pull American troops out after [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=206.0s)]
*  20 years because on that one, the American public has been with them clearly and may continue to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=212.08s)]
*  with them. They have a more difficult set of facts in defending how they were taken by surprise [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=217.12s)]
*  by the Taliban onslaught overtaking the country, even though you could see for weeks that Taliban [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=223.76s)]
*  was winning these provincial capitals and that the Afghan military was really no match for the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=229.28s)]
*  Taliban fighters. So it was sort of clear that we can litigate all that after the fact. But what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=235.28s)]
*  you're seeing now is a shift in tone from the White House from being defiant and defensive to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=240.24s)]
*  trying to just do a better job of expectation setting, I think, with the public. When you see [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=244.64s)]
*  Jake Sullivan at the podium, when you saw the president yesterday, and really acknowledging [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=249.76s)]
*  the more complex reality of the situation, this airlift that is ongoing and will be ongoing at [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=254.16s)]
*  least through the 31st can be a really impressive feat of collaboration, military diplomatic [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=259.52s)]
*  achievement, and also be a total mess and be really difficult getting a lot of these Afghans [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  through some of these checkpoints. And the pressure is going to continue to build, even [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=271.68s)]
*  as they acknowledge both sides of the coin there. There are a lot of folks in Congress who are calling [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  on this White House to stay. It's not just the British. It's not just European allies. It's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=282.32s)]
*  people right here in Washington who the president needs to advance his agenda who are calling [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=286.64s)]
*  publicly on the commander in chief to keep forces there longer. And they've kind of been a little [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  wishy-washy on this. They continue to say we will get every last American out who wants to get out, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=297.12s)]
*  but they are not making the same promise about the Afghans. President Biden was asked point [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=302.64s)]
*  blank, does that promise extend to the Afghans? And he said it does. But he also said that, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=306.56s)]
*  you know, you're not going to be able to airlift every Afghan who wants to leave the country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  So this is going to continue to be difficult politically for the White House. They are going [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=317.36s)]
*  to continue to show just how effective the airlift is to continue to give those numbers [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=322.72s)]
*  thousands of people being flown to other countries every day. And it really is impressive. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=327.6s)]
*  And they are saving those people's lives. But come the 31st, there may be a lot of people, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  there probably inevitably will be a lot of people who are left behind. And that is going to be [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=337.92s)]
*  something that is difficult for this White House to talk about as they weigh whether or not to stay [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  beyond the deadline that the president himself has set. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=348.24s)]
*  Donna, your sense of where that advocacy from people on Capitol Hill is factoring [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=351.12s)]
*  into this administration's decision making? Well, I think that what you can see over the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=357.2s)]
*  last several days is that the administration, an administration of president who ran on the idea [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  of being able to deliver and being competent is clearing up that competency. And I think that the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=369.2s)]
*  more that these later stages of the evacuation proceed, getting more people out, our air mobility [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=374.96s)]
*  units really doing their job, the more that erases the pictures of the early days that the president [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=383.52s)]
*  was faced with. And I happen to believe that a year from now what we are going to be remembering [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=392.0s)]
*  is the number of Americans who exited Afghanistan, the number of Afghans who were able to get out [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=397.6s)]
*  safely, and of course the end of the war. But the president right now, his task is to do this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=408.16s)]
*  in a much more competent way so that it erases those early pictures. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=415.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMe37wZg00&t=427.6s)]
