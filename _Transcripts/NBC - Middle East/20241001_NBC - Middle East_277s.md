# How Iran’s next attack on Israel could be more serious than its April retaliation
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Courtney Qubee. Everybody else, please stay with us. But Courtney, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=0.0s)]
*  I know you've been working your resources with the Pentagon and you are on the reporting team [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=3.6s)]
*  with this new information about the potential imminent attack coming from Iran launching [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=7.76s)]
*  potentially ballistic missiles against Israel. Again, all of this hasn't happened yet. It's our [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=14.32s)]
*  reporting. But what do we know about how the U.S. is communicating with Israel and so forth and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  what we are prepared for, the U.S. is prepared for in this moment? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And Anna, you hit the nail on the head here. So the big question right now is, yes, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=29.36s)]
*  we have officials telling us this is imminent, but has it actually begun? So think back to April. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=34.96s)]
*  You'll remember that Iran and proxy groups started firing off projectiles like loitering [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=40.0s)]
*  munitions or drones several hours before they actually started impacting or really threatening [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=45.84s)]
*  Israel. In the case of April, there was really a wave of launches that really culminated with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=52.08s)]
*  the ballistic missile launches and the cruise missiles that we were just hearing about. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=58.24s)]
*  So the U.S. has been expecting for some time because of exactly all the provocations that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=61.92s)]
*  we have heard about so eloquently from Matt over the last few minutes, the assassination of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=68.0s)]
*  Hania back in July, of course Nasrallah's death last week by the Israeli military. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=73.04s)]
*  There has been an expectation and Iran has threatened to respond. So what we keep looking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=79.28s)]
*  back is how did they respond in April? The expectation here at the Pentagon is that we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=84.48s)]
*  will see something that could go a little bit beyond April, but we shouldn't just look at [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=89.28s)]
*  numbers as far as how it could escalate. In April, remember, there were about 300 different [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=93.92s)]
*  projectiles, but they were all the different ones that we heard about. Officials are talking more [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=100.08s)]
*  specifically this time about ballistic missiles. Now there were more than 100 missiles that were [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=104.64s)]
*  launched in April, but it feels as if what we are looking at here is the potential for even more [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=109.6s)]
*  ballistic missiles specifically this time. Now why that is concerning, they move faster. They [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=114.88s)]
*  tend to have a much bigger payload. They have the possibility of simply a bigger impact on the ground [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=120.48s)]
*  there. Now the U.S. has ever since all of these provocations and escalations really started back [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=126.0s)]
*  in July and culminating with over the weekend after the death of Nasrallah, the military has [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=131.36s)]
*  continually said, the U.S. military, that they have a robust presence in the region more, frankly, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=136.72000000000003s)]
*  than they had during those April attacks from Iran, and they are confident that they can help [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=143.84s)]
*  Israel defend itself. Now they even are sending, the U.S. has sent some more assets so far. They [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=149.68s)]
*  are moving some more into the region, but they already felt pretty confident that they could [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=156.8s)]
*  defend. But here is another thing that is different from April, Anna. Number one, then you will recall [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=160.24s)]
*  it was a huge regional response, defensive response to Iran. Allies helped with some air defenses. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  They allowed overflight of U.S. assets, U.S. jets and things over their countries to help with this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  defense. It is not clear right now where that stands, and that could be a big change from this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  Another thing, officials still feel pretty confident that, like in April, the targets would not be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=186.16s)]
*  largely civilian in nature inside Israel. The expectation is that if and when Iran does carry [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  out this attack, they will go largely after Israeli military assets and even government assets, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  as opposed to targeting civilians. Now, remember, that doesn't mean that there won't be civilians [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=206.0s)]
*  nearby. I'm not saying that that decreases the potential threat here, but the expectation is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=210.96s)]
*  that they would go more after military and government targets as opposed to civilian officials. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=216.24s)]
*  So that's where we stand right now. Again, the U.S. military, who has pledged that they will help [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel defend themselves against any possible attack, has more assets there now than they did [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=230.8s)]
*  in April, and we are hearing a lot of confidence that they will have the ability to, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=237.12s)]
*  an expectation that they will be able to defend against any kind of attack. At this point, again, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  the officials I'm speaking with do not have confirmation that anything has begun, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  but we could see as in April more of like a rolling response here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOIotIQRkGE&t=267.04s)]
