# Biden On End Of Afghanistan War And 'Selfless Courage' of Service Members
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE)
*  The extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=0.0s)]
*  bravery, and selfless courage of the United States military and our diplomats [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=5.12s)]
*  and intelligence professionals. For weeks, they risked their lives to get American citizens, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=10.16s)]
*  Afghans who helped us, citizens of our allies and partners and others on board planes and out of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=16.96s)]
*  the country. And they did it facing a crush of enormous crowds seeking to leave the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=23.36s)]
*  And they did it knowing ISIS-K terrorists, sworn enemies of the Taliban, were lurking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=30.32s)]
*  in the midst of those crowds. And still, the women and men of the United States military, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=37.2s)]
*  our diplomatic corps, and intelligence professionals did their job and did it well, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=43.68s)]
*  risking their lives not for professional gains but to serve others. Not in a mission of war [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=49.28s)]
*  but in a mission of mercy. Twenty service members were wounded in the service of this mission. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=57.6s)]
*  Thirteen heroes gave their lives. I was just at Dover Air Force Base for the dignified transfer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=64.0s)]
*  We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude we can never repay but we should never, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  ever forget. In April, I made a decision to end this war. As part of that decision, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=79.36s)]
*  we set the date of August 31st for American troops to withdraw. The assumption was that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=88.32s)]
*  more than 300,000 Afghan National Security Forces that we had trained over the past two decades [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=94.24s)]
*  and equipped would be a strong adversary in their civil wars with the Taliban. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=101.04s)]
*  That assumption that the Afghan government would be able to hold on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  for a period of time beyond military drawdown turned out not to be accurate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  But I still instructed our national security team to prepare for every eventuality, even that one. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=119.76s)]
*  And that's what we did. So we were ready when the Afghan security forces, after two decades of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=127.28s)]
*  fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own, did not hold on as long as anyone [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=133.52s)]
*  expected. We were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=140.72s)]
*  and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  their enemies, to Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to U.S. personnel and our [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=154.08s)]
*  allies. As a result, to safely extract American citizens before August 31st, as well as embassy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=160.8s)]
*  personnel, allies and partners, and those Afghans who had worked with us and fought alongside of us [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=169.68s)]
*  for 20 years, I had authorized 6,000 troops, American troops, to Kabul to help secure the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=177.2s)]
*  airport. As General McKenzie said, this is the way the mission was designed. It was designed to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=185.28s)]
*  operate under severe stress and attack. And that's what it did. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6vCt2MISE&t=193.68s)]
