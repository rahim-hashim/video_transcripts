# U.S. strikes have begun in Iraq and Syria after drone attack killed 3 American troops
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI)
*  We have breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. has launched airstrikes in retaliation for an attack on a U.S. base in Jordan that [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=2.44s)]
*  killed three soldiers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=7.36s)]
*  Let's bring in National Security and Global Affairs reporter for NBC News' investigative [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=8.36s)]
*  unit Dan Deluse at the Pentagon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=12.88s)]
*  Dan? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=15.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=16.68s)]
*  Defense officials are telling us that the retaliatory airstrikes have begun in Iraq [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=17.68s)]
*  and Syria against Iranian-backed militias, something that obviously the White House has [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=22.96s)]
*  been warning they would do. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=28.24s)]
*  It has now begun. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  This operation has been pretty clearly now telegraphed for days since three U.S. soldiers [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=31.6s)]
*  were killed in Jordan in that drone attack on Sunday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=37.44s)]
*  And now this operation has begun. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=41.6s)]
*  And keep in mind, administration officials have made it clear that this is not a one-off, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=44.08s)]
*  that this will extend beyond today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Over days it will be a campaign. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=51.92s)]
*  It will involve multiple strikes and other operations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=54.28s)]
*  But right now we can say that the retaliatory strikes have begun in Iraq and Syria against [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=58.28s)]
*  those Iranian-backed militias that have launched more than 160 attacks on U.S. forces since [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=64.4s)]
*  October 7th, since that war started between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=71.68s)]
*  Dan, do we have any further details on the targets in Iraq and in Syria? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  They are not releasing those details yet. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  But judging by—keep in mind, we've had previous airstrikes in the past, more limited [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=83.64s)]
*  airstrikes, against those militias. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=87.56s)]
*  And they tend to go after weapons depots. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=91.4s)]
*  They go after different sites used by the militias, including command and control sites, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  anywhere where they believe they can degrade the capability of these militias, which of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=100.16s)]
*  course, as we know, are financed, trained, and armed by Iran and have been a thorn in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  the side of the U.S. forces there for years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=111.04s)]
*  But of course, there is no indication at the moment that the U.S. is taking any action [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=114.2s)]
*  inside Iranian territory. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=120.6s)]
*  So these strikes are taking place in Iraq and Syria, where those militia groups are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=122.52s)]
*  based and where they operate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=129.28s)]
*  But of course, there's a challenge here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=130.76s)]
*  Once the U.S. warned that it would respond to that drone attack, that has given the militias [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=132.36s)]
*  time to evacuate and to hide and conceal their weapons and their capabilities. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=138.04s)]
*  Dan, as you described, as officials have described, this is likely to be a tiered approach. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=143.76s)]
*  Your sense of what that might look like? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to see a much larger scale of airstrikes than we've seen up until [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=151.12s)]
*  now, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=155.28s)]
*  Until now, they were quite limited, quite calibrated over the past few months. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=156.28s)]
*  This is going to be a much larger scale involving a lot more aircraft, a lot more missiles, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=160.94s)]
*  dozens of targets, I would guess, judging by what they've been indicating in advance. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=168.88s)]
*  And then keep in mind, too, at some point, I think it's fair to assume there will be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=174.08s)]
*  strikes at sea or, excuse me, against the Houthis in Yemen who have been attacking those [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=179.24s)]
*  commercial ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  We have no indication there are any operations right now targeting the Houthis in Yemen [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=189.18s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=193.72s)]
*  But I think it's fair to assume that that will come as part of this multi-tiered campaign [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=195.28s)]
*  as they're describing it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now, retired four-star general and MSNBC military analyst Barry McCaffrey. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  General McCaffrey, what are you looking for as this story develops? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=208.16s)]
*  Well, I think since the strike on Tower 22 with a pretty significant U.S. casualty, three [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=211.72s)]
*  kill in action, more than 50 now pointing wounded in action, U.S. intelligence has been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=220.44s)]
*  blanketing the region trying to see where the threats are. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=225.88s)]
*  They are moving. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=230.44s)]
*  They're all trying to disguise themselves. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=231.6s)]
*  They've turned off all their radios. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=233.48s)]
*  The Houthis have turned off their radars in particular. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=235.56s)]
*  But we've been watching them moving. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=238.76s)]
*  So I won't think that we have lost much in terms of delaying multiple days, anything [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=241.6s)]
*  we've added to it because they get them up and running. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=248.6s)]
*  As Dan very accurately reported, this is going to be a multi-week, probably, response, hopefully [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=252.56s)]
*  decentralized. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=258.88s)]
*  It will involve both U.S. Navy and Air Force power. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=260.56s)]
*  There may well be classified aspects to it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=265.4s)]
*  In other words, Delta Force going into Syria or other places and snatching some of these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=269.2s)]
*  leaders. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=275.6s)]
*  Never mind cyber warfare and economic action. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=277.32s)]
*  So as Secretary Austin stated, we've got to degrade capabilities and not just do a one-off [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=280.76s)]
*  campaign. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=289.0s)]
*  To your point about what Defense Secretary Austin said yesterday, he said specifically [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=290.0s)]
*  it's time to take away even more capability than we've taken in the past. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=294.44s)]
*  Give us a sense of scope. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=299.04s)]
*  What might that look like? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=300.96s)]
*  Well, the toughest target is still the Houthis, the Red Sea, enormous economic consequences. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=303.4s)]
*  It's affecting world trade. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=312.44s)]
*  It's driving up prices. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=313.96s)]
*  The Egyptians remain mute with their Suez Canal losing revenue. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  So what you do about the Houthis is hard to program. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, you get about a third of the country. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a Shia militia organization very closely allied with Iran. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=326.68s)]
*  It's got some fairly significant weapons, both ballistic and drone missiles, and it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=331.68s)]
*  definitely can strike in this very constrained waterway international shipping. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=336.92s)]
*  That one's a real challenge. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=343.6s)]
*  I think the terrorist organizations in both Syria and Iraq, it'll have to be over time. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=345.56s)]
*  Well, I just have to watch for them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=351.8s)]
*  Every time they move, they'll get struck. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=353.8s)]
*  But even there, we have an unusual problem. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=356.44s)]
*  Iraq vehemently opposes any U.S. military action inside Iraq. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=359.76s)]
*  We're there, 2,500 troops with part of an international coalition counter ISIS in nature [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=364.0s)]
*  at the request of the Iraqi government. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, Secretary Blinken, who's made every effort to try and keep this conflict [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=375.0s)]
*  from escalating, is now facing renewed challenges. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=380.44s)]
*  The good news, we're not going into Iran with strikes yet. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=384.6s)]
*  General McCaffrey, can you give us a sense of how you define success with a mission like this? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=389.12s)]
*  Well, that's the $64 million question for sure. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  I think that to some extent, you simply have to respond. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  I've been really distraught listening to people say, well, now they've killed some U.S. soldiers. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=406.4s)]
*  Now we've got to act. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=412.84s)]
*  We've had 160 some odd strikes on U.S. forces. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=414.12s)]
*  You simply cannot take away the inherent right of self-defense and immediate action and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=417.92s)]
*  decentralized responses if you're going to keep military forces deployed in such a dangerous [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=425.24s)]
*  environment. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=430.28s)]
*  So hopefully that those days are behind us and we'll now have a more active protection of the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=431.4s)]
*  forces themselves. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=438.76s)]
*  But the important question you raise is, what is the strategic purpose for these deployments? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=440.12s)]
*  And we're going to have to rethink that because bombing militia units and Shia militia units in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=448.0s)]
*  Iraq is not a long term solution to anything. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=454.36s)]
*  Well, give us a sense of what those conversations look like when you're talking about strategic [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=457.96s)]
*  purpose. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=461.88s)]
*  That is something that is constantly evaluated and reevaluated. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=462.32s)]
*  You have been in the rooms where those conversations happen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=465.76s)]
*  Give us a sense. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=469.28s)]
*  How frequently are they happening? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=469.92s)]
*  How many times will they happen in the next few days? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=471.8s)]
*  What are the data points they will be looking for? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=473.92s)]
*  Well, that National Security Council meets at various levels of officialdom, you know, from [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=477.96s)]
*  the three star Pentagon level, as whole of government, State Department, Treasury, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=483.28s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=490.48s)]
*  All of them are involved. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=492.92s)]
*  This is going on day and night, seven days a week, trying to manage really the top current [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=495.28s)]
*  defense challenge to the United States. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=502.8s)]
*  By the time an issue gets to the NSC, there are no good options. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=505.79999999999995s)]
*  Everything you're considering has unpalatable implications. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=510.84s)]
*  What happens after we take this action? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  That's why I think wisely they're publicly signaling we're not going to go after Iran yet. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=518.12s)]
*  Iran is the centerpiece orchestrating funding, training, equipping and to some extent, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=524.68s)]
*  directing what is a regional war against U.S. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=531.04s)]
*  and Israeli interests and part of the domination of the Sunni Muslim population. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=535.6s)]
*  So it's not going to go away with this current air campaign. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=542.64s)]
*  We're in a long term, complex, dangerous situation that we have to face up to. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=548.16s)]
*  General McCaffrey, there is, of course, always in these situations a question of proportionality. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=554.44s)]
*  How does the Biden administration decide what is a proportional response? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=559.72s)]
*  How do they make that decision, that determination? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, I hope they're deciding on a disproportional response. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=568.28s)]
*  I mean, that's a problem. If you get one lousy drone, maybe a 300 kilogram warhead on it that slams into a sleeping [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=572.72s)]
*  area and causes 50 some odd U.S. casualties, that drone probably cost $20,000 to manufacture. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=581.7199999999999s)]
*  The people who fired it, it may have been a dozen people, none of them with graduate degrees from the Army War College. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  So you really have to go after decision makers. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  You have to have a whole of government responses. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=602.56s)]
*  You know, it's got to be cyber warfare, classified covert action, economic constraints as well as military power. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=606.4s)]
*  We've got to up the game. You know, I hope we're going to see U.S. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  Air Force heavy bombers going after fixed installations, not a targeted 500 pound JDAM, but 100 munitions striking a target to try and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=618.4s)]
*  stun these people and have them change their ways. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1eD3pkIjWI&t=632.48s)]
