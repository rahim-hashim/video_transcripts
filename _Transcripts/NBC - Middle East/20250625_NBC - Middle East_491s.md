# 'Striking' Trump has been 'so open' about Iran telegraphing their plan to target U.S. base: Kube
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg)
*  It was very, very successful. It was called obliteration. We assessed that the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=7.0s)]
*  for many years to come. We've collected additional intelligence. We've also spoken to people [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=12.92s)]
*  who have seen the site, and the site is obliterated. And we think everything nuclear is down there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=17.92s)]
*  They didn't take it out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=24.8s)]
*  NBC News cannot confirm if Iran actually moved their nuclear materials out of those facilities [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  before the U.S. strikes. We began with former U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Obama, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Ambassador Ivo Dalder, and global affairs journalist Kevin Barron, president of Elevation [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=38.56s)]
*  Global Strategies. Let me start with you, Kevin. What were your takeaways in terms of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=43.4s)]
*  what we just heard from the president, and whether there was any clarity in terms of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=48.92s)]
*  where we stand right now in terms of Iran's nuclear program? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=53.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, we don't have your audio, Kevin. We're going to work on getting that back. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=65.88000000000001s)]
*  Sorry, how about now? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=69.88s)]
*  Oh, we have you now. Please continue. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=70.88s)]
*  Thank you. I've said as a journalist who's covered the Pentagon for 15 years and lots [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=72.88s)]
*  of NATO summits, the headline that struck me was Trump telling the world, boasting to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=76.88s)]
*  the world, that he gave Iran permission to strike a U.S. military base. That line where [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=81.92s)]
*  he said, when they asked, oh, is one o'clock OK? I said, fine, sure. We move people out, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=86.92s)]
*  go right ahead. That, to me, is unbelievable. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=90.92s)]
*  I think that's something we can't just paper over and take as the normal course of events [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=94.92s)]
*  in this combat mission that happened. So I'd start with that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Second, the reporting and the back and forth about this intelligence assessment. I was [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  the editor of a defense publication for 10 years and spent a lot of my time being very [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  careful with headlines and how we characterize what we're reporting. I think there's a little [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  bit of truth on both sides here. This is an initial intelligence assessment. It's from [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  DIA, yes, but it did say low confidence. If you don't lead with that, you set up this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  kind of conflict and it's kind of you give a win to the people you're reporting on to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=128.96s)]
*  come back and say, hey, you're mischaracterizing here. I think we're seeing a little bit of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=132.96s)]
*  that happening. The president's right to say that this is an initial report. It's a DIA [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=137.0s)]
*  report. It's not the official White House assessment. It's by no means a final assessment. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=141.0s)]
*  But where they go over the line is this just insistence that they got it right. The [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=145.0s)]
*  obliterated line and the very odd kind of childish deflection of, oh, why don't you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=151.0s)]
*  reporters, you know, why are you making the pilots feel bad? I guarantee you no pilot [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=155.0s)]
*  feels bad about the job they did. They did just fine. And it's not the job of the media [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=159.0s)]
*  to be celebrating the president's wins or the military strikes. It's their job to report [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=164.04s)]
*  on them. So I think Kelly O'Donnell did a great job in that press conference with her [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=169.04s)]
*  exchange with the president. But the constant denigration of the media reporting, especially [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=173.04s)]
*  abroad at a NATO event, is just something you never see in normal times. It's one of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=177.04s)]
*  the yet again. And again, that line of the president admitting that he gave Iran permission [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=182.04s)]
*  to attack the U.S. military base is just unfathomable to me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  I want to bring back NBC's Courtney QB from the Pentagon and Courtney, you know, we heard [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  from the defense secretary who also brought up this intelligence report that was leaked [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  saying that it was a low confidence report, meaning that there's low confidence in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  data in that report because it was perhaps a little bit dated and that nobody's been [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  on the ground and that the evidence is under the rubble. And yet wouldn't that also indicate [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  that when we hear from the administration, their assessment that everything was obliterated [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=216.12s)]
*  is also on shaky ground and is not certain? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=221.12s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. So they're basically trying to have it both ways here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=225.12s)]
*  It's that this again, it's a U.S. government product that that found that there was likely [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=228.12s)]
*  destruction that was done to at least four dough that set it back a number of months [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=234.12s)]
*  up three to six months. It did not find that the nuclear program was destroyed altogether. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=240.16s)]
*  And but then we have the president who's citing other intelligence agencies and other [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=246.16s)]
*  countries saying, oh, well, it was it was destroyed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=252.16s)]
*  So they must be right because it fit the narrative. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=255.16s)]
*  I mean, if if the president hadn't come out that first day and said that the program had [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=258.16s)]
*  been obliterated, something that was repeated even again today, if they hadn't said he and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=264.16s)]
*  those around him hadn't continued to say that the program wasn't obliterated, this may not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  be such a dispute. It may just be this is an early assessment. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think we should call it that. This is a very early preliminary assessment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  President Trump even said that more information had already come in. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  We expect more information will continue to come in. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  But that does not change the fact that this first assessment found what it did. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  One thing I completely agree with, Kevin, that it is it is absolutely striking that the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=294.24s)]
*  president has been has been so open about Iran telegraphing that they were going to target [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=299.24s)]
*  a base in Qatar that houses U.S. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=305.24s)]
*  troops that has not only thousands of Americans there, but also millions and millions of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=308.24s)]
*  dollars in American hardware there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=313.24s)]
*  It's it's the biggest base housing Americans in the entire region. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=315.24s)]
*  The fact that he acknowledged that Iran gave the U.S. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=319.24s)]
*  And then he said, OK, we'll get everyone out of there and then you guys can carry out your attack. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  That's a remarkable acknowledgement that we just heard from him in a very casual way. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  But I'm also struck by the fact that when asked about this classified assessment, the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  rather than say we're not going to talk about a classified intelligence community product [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  instead, the initial reaction is just to attack the media about it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  They are essentially confirming the conclusions of this assessment because they're talking [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=348.32s)]
*  about something that, again, is classified. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=353.32s)]
*  It's it's it's it's several remarkable and very unusual things that we we don't normally [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=355.32s)]
*  hear out of the president of the United States here on a ambassador. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=360.32s)]
*  I'm wondering what kind of a curveball this whole Iran situation was and all this talk [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=363.32s)]
*  about what intelligence to believe is for the NATO summit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=368.32s)]
*  Well, in some ways was a nice curveball because it withdrew attention, which what many European [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=373.36s)]
*  leaders, including the NATO secretary general, were worried about from the repeated statements [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=378.36s)]
*  by President Trump that he was thinking about perhaps withdrawing from NATO or leaving even [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=385.36s)]
*  as he was flying to the summit. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=390.36s)]
*  He said there are multiple definitions of what Article five means, implying that somehow [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=392.36s)]
*  the ironclad guarantee that it can attack against one is an attack against all is something [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  that can be called into question. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  So while Iran overshadowed the summit, it allowed the actual NATO business to move forward [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  in the way that European leaders had had planned and hoped, which is to get the president [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  of the United States to come to the summit, to reaffirm that America will remain engaged [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  in NATO, to give him and allow him to claim a win on more defense spending, which is something [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=423.44s)]
*  he has pressed for. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=431.44s)]
*  Of course, one of the reasons we have more defense spending is because the United States [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=432.44s)]
*  under Donald Trump is called into question whether the United States will continue to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=436.44s)]
*  defend Europe. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=442.44s)]
*  He has called Ukraine a European issue. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=443.44s)]
*  He refused to say that Vladimir Putin is a threat or an adversary, even when he was asked [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=445.44s)]
*  during the press conference. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=452.48s)]
*  So there are major differences between Europe and the United States, but the good news for [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=453.48s)]
*  I think NATO, the good news for Europe, and the good news frankly for the United States [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=458.48s)]
*  is that the president of the United States came to NATO for 24 hours and is leaving with [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=462.48s)]
*  the alliance very much intact and the Europeans committed to doing a lot more. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=467.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPf-rBg7wg&t=482.44s)]
