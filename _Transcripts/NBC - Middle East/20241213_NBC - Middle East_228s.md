# ‘Dire humanitarian emergency’: Gaza ranked one of the most at risk regions for 2025
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc)
*  Joining me now is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, David [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=0.0s)]
*  Miliband, former UK Foreign Secretary. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=3.72s)]
*  David, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  So the IRC has a new emergency watch list out this week, but I want to start with Syria, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=8.46s)]
*  which is number four on your list. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=13.84s)]
*  How does the fall of the Assad regime impact the humanitarian crisis there, and what are [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=15.92s)]
*  the limitations on what can be done as long as the leader of the rebel forces and his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=20.88s)]
*  part of this very diverse group is under sanctions for being on the terror list? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Thanks very much, Andrea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=34.64s)]
*  Gaza and West Bank are number two on our watch list of humanitarian disasters awaiting us [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=36.96s)]
*  in 2025, and Syria, as you say, is number four. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=42.0s)]
*  So this is absolutely pivotal news that you are reporting and has been happening, especially [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  in Syria, over the last 10 days to two weeks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=51.36s)]
*  We've been working with the International Rescue Committee in Syria since the civil [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  war began. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  We never bought the argument that war was over because the country was divided. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  There were seven million refugees outside the country, and there was huge need inside [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=63.04s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=67.84s)]
*  I think there are some immediate priorities. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=68.84s)]
*  The border crossings that have been closed by the Assad regime for aid are being opened. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=70.84s)]
*  That's a big step forward. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=75.6s)]
*  There needs to be a whole of Syria strategy for the distribution of humanitarian aid and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=76.6s)]
*  the access of aid workers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=81.44s)]
*  That's a big step forward. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=83.64s)]
*  There needs to be guarding against hyperinflation because that's an obvious danger to drive [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=84.64s)]
*  people into humanitarian need. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=90.0s)]
*  And obviously, the health system in Syria needs to be sustained because that's been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=92.2s)]
*  under enormous pressure. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=96.44s)]
*  All of that is possible even before you get to the question of recognition with the new [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=97.44s)]
*  authorities. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=102.4s)]
*  As it happens, we've had experience over the last 12 years in the northwest of Syria working [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=103.4s)]
*  our humanitarian work to be going ahead with 450 staff under the rule of those who are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=109.8s)]
*  now moving into control of the whole of Syria. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=115.08s)]
*  And I can report to you that they've allowed us to do our work without fear or favor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=117.64s)]
*  They've not tried to take our money. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=122.28s)]
*  They've not tried to decide who we serve. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=123.8s)]
*  And I think that's very important if we think about the needs of the whole of Syria going [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=126.4s)]
*  forward. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=129.76s)]
*  Let's turn to Gaza, which, as you point out, is number two on your list. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=130.76s)]
*  The UN says that the humanitarian aid situation to northern Gaza is being blocked and has [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=136.28s)]
*  been for the last two months. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=141.36s)]
*  This is an enormous area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=143.18s)]
*  It's an area where people were moving for safety. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=144.18s)]
*  What needs to be done to get aid to the people who need it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=147.56s)]
*  Yeah, when Gaza has a population in total of about two million, as you know, there's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=151.12s)]
*  been multiple displacement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=155.84s)]
*  And the north of Gaza is home to about 75,000 to 100,000 people, we think now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=157.72s)]
*  We have partner organizations working there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's absolutely correct that it's the most dire humanitarian emergency. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=165.64s)]
*  The very cautious part of the UN system that ranks places for food insecurity, for famine, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=170.28s)]
*  has put the north of Gaza at catastrophic levels. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=177.44s)]
*  I have to say the center and south of Gaza is also at very high levels of humanitarian [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=180.56s)]
*  need. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=185.92s)]
*  But what you're reporting about a ceasefire that would allow hostages to be released, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=186.92s)]
*  allow aid to flow, allow aid workers to get to work, allow the injured to be treated inside [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=191.76s)]
*  Gaza and those in great need to be tended to, that's desperately needed because it remains [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=197.32s)]
*  an absolutely critical humanitarian catastrophe that's happening in that part of the world. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDSi1gQLFc&t=203.51999999999998s)]
