# ‘Whole series of questions’: Top Foreign Affairs Dem on Israel-Iran conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw)
*  New York Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=0.0s)]
*  is joining us now. Congressman Meeks, thanks so much for being here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=3.68s)]
*  So the White House saying a decision in two weeks. I'm curious, have you been briefed at all on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=7.44s)]
*  what's happening in Iran and the U.S. administration's current thinking? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=14.08s)]
*  I have not. I've been asking for briefings as the ranking Democrat, former chair of the committee. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=17.84s)]
*  I've talked to some of my other colleagues. I don't know much of anyone, maybe one committee, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=23.76s)]
*  the intelligence committee might have met once in that regards, but there's been nothing that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=28.8s)]
*  has come to me, although almost on a continuous basis every day I'm asking for a classified meeting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  What are your biggest concerns and what are your top questions you want answered? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, number one, I think that it's important for members of Congress and us to follow the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=43.36s)]
*  Constitution that says we have a decision-making process and whether or not American troops will [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=49.68s)]
*  go on the ground and things of that nature. So my question is to try to find out or have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=54.16s)]
*  verified some of the things that we hear in the media. What do we know? How far away is Iran from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=58.32s)]
*  having a nuclear weapon? What's going on? How much ammunition that each side may have? So we need to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  know, we've got to make sure that Israel is how it has what it needs to defend itself. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=72.88s)]
*  What's taking place with reference to negotiations and who's negotiating and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=78.88s)]
*  where are we in that phase so that we can make sure that in that regards diplomacy does have a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=82.72s)]
*  role? What's happening with reference to Americans that are in Israel and getting them out of Israel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=89.52s)]
*  and the safety of those Americans to get them back home? Is there a plan to do that? And what is that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=95.68s)]
*  plan for Americans in the region? What is conversations that have taken place with others [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  in the region? It's important for what the end game may be. And so where is Saudi Arabia? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=106.08s)]
*  Where is Jordan? Where is Egypt who are now recognizes Israel's right to exist? What role [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=112.16s)]
*  of airplane? What happens in the region? And what is the efficiency of the B-2 bomber? This is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=117.92s)]
*  something that has never been utilized before. So will it work? Will it won't work? What collateral [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=123.2s)]
*  damage there may be? So there's a whole series of questions that I would have in regards to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=128.4s)]
*  what's taking place. You point out just how layered the situation is, how complex it is, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=134.4s)]
*  and how many different pieces of the puzzle need to be fit and put into place in order to understand [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=138.72s)]
*  what is the best path forward. You talked about the lack of clarity when it comes to the intelligence [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=144.8s)]
*  over how far along Iran's nuclear program is. We are being told that the CIA director has said [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=150.24s)]
*  privately that Iran is viewed as being very close to possessing a nuclear weapon. In the meantime, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=155.68s)]
*  we've also heard the official US assessment has gone unchanged since March when we heard the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=161.28s)]
*  director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testify that Tehran has not decided to rush toward [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=167.52s)]
*  building a nuclear weapon. So which is it? That's what we need to know. Who should the president be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  listening to? We need to know and we need to have those facts. You know, I've been in Congress now [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=178.8s)]
*  long enough to remember and had to vote on whether or not we would go to war in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  At that time, when the president George W. Bush, we were able to get information. I was able to go [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=188.96s)]
*  to the Pentagon. I was able to talk to generals, individuals. The secretary of state came before [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=195.04s)]
*  our committee and testified both in public and in private so that we can try to adduce what's taking [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=200.48s)]
*  place and what the facts are on the ground. We've got zero of that right now and I think that that's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=206.48s)]
*  a danger for all of us. That's why the Constitution says that Congress has the authority to determine [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=212.88s)]
*  when we go to war and when we don't. But we've got to get the information. We should not just rely [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  upon one person because, you know, look, and one reason that I think that we are there is his [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=224.16s)]
*  judgment to pull out of the JCPOA, the previous agreement. I don't think we would be where we are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=231.92s)]
*  now if we had still been in that agreement with our friends and allies and even some who are not, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=237.12s)]
*  like China and Russia at that particular time that was part of that agreement. So there's a lot to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=242.72s)]
*  unfold and a lot to look at and we just can't rely upon just one person. Members of Congress [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=247.2s)]
*  should have access to this information. Well, we are reporting that the DNI, Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=252.72s)]
*  is sidelined right now. We also have this reporting that the president is not routinely [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=259.12s)]
*  engaging with his defense secretary over this type of matter, important military, you know, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=264.96s)]
*  matters involving potential strikes in the region. We've got a lot of military assets and 40,000 [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=270.72s)]
*  U.S. troops in the Middle East region as well. Are you concerned? What concerns do you have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=275.92s)]
*  over who is and isn't part of some of these conversations? I have a lot of concerns, you know, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=282.16s)]
*  even prior to going in, you know, there's been concerns about the judgment of the president. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=287.92s)]
*  So I can't take it for granted that the president is giving us the facts. We hear, as you've reported [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=292.72s)]
*  over and over again, he just says in two weeks, in two weeks, in two weeks. But there, you know, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  with the House of Representatives or the Congress being an equal branch of government, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  we don't just accept the word of the president. We make sure that we are talking to the president [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=309.92s)]
*  and then make our determination based upon access to the executive branch and the information there [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=314.72s)]
*  in. That is lacking now, and it's problematic. And I would hope that during this two-week period [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  of time, if it's indeed two weeks, because as you have reported, you know, we've heard this several [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=325.92s)]
*  times from the president, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, and a whole host of issues. But I would [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=331.44s)]
*  hope this time that we would have that dialogue and conversation. You know, it's a problem for me [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=335.84s)]
*  when you look at the number of diplomats that are no longer there. You know, the State Department [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  that has been downgraded, you know, experts that we would have had negotiating, has no, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=345.84s)]
*  no this situation backwards and forwards, of which I think could have given the president very good [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  advice. Are they there? Who they're talking to? You know, I have a job to do so that I can report [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=356.55999999999995s)]
*  to the American people in the districts, the district that I represent, but the American [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=362.96s)]
*  people as a whole, as the ranking Democrat on this committee. Let me ask you, while I have you in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  pivot to a different subject matter, the New York Times is reporting that you and seven other House [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=371.28s)]
*  Democrats are demanding answers from DHS Secretary Christine Noem in a letter being sent today, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  queues the immigration officials of preventing Congress from access to a detention facility in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  lower Manhattan. You talk about your oversight responsibilities. So what more can you tell us [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  about that? Well, here again, look, this is what my concern is about this administration. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=390.96s)]
*  He's continuously tried to go around Congress and block Congress from doing its constitutionally [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=395.52s)]
*  responsible duties. We all and have oversight and should be let into these facilities without [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=401.2s)]
*  notice, because if you have notice, then they can try to, you know, fix something up that's not [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=408.96s)]
*  actual. The way that you find out what actually is taking place. And we've done this under several [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=414.88s)]
*  administrations, Democrat and Republican. Previously, you're able to walk in and make [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=420.32s)]
*  an assessment of what is and what is not taking place when you are prevented from doing your job [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=425.2s)]
*  and prevented from, you know, doing what the constitution says you do should be doing. Then [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=430.56s)]
*  it makes you feel that there is something going on that should not be going on. And we look at the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=435.68s)]
*  process right now with a president who says he doesn't have, doesn't want to abide by court [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=441.68s)]
*  decisions and does not want Congress to play the appropriate role and responsibility that it has [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=447.12s)]
*  as given by the constitutions is problematic. Just quickly, if you will, if the administration [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=453.52s)]
*  keeps stonewalling in this fashion, what more can you do? Well, again, we've got to do what we have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=458.48s)]
*  done. We've got to go to the courts and say and sue. Unfortunately, we have to do that. We have [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=463.92s)]
*  to continue to bring it up to the American people as well, because I think that brings some also [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=469.52s)]
*  some contention. And I would hope, though, that my Republican colleagues, because I think that would [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=476.0s)]
*  make a difference if they stood up also, because what we don't want is the responsibilities that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=480.72s)]
*  the House and the Senate has to be whisked away and all given to the president, because then [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=488.24s)]
*  you're dealing with a king and not a president of the United States of America. Well, thank you so [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=493.6s)]
*  much, Congressman Gregory Meeks. We appreciate you coming in and making your case and providing [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=499.76s)]
*  your insights. Thank you for having me. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1MkEnMcNw&t=504.48s)]
