# ‘We are trying to live’: Two Teenage refugees document their lives in war-torn Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo)
*  One of the biggest challenges in reporting war in Gaza is the lack of media and the lack of journalists on the ground there right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=0.0s)]
*  Since the war began Israel has imposed strict limits on foreign journalists ability to access Gaza [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=7.5s)]
*  Unless accompanied by the Israeli military and since foreign journalists have had extremely limited access to Gaza [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=14.46s)]
*  The vast majority of the images and videos and firsthand reports that the world is seeing from the region are coming from Palestinian [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=20.3s)]
*  Journalists who are already inside [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=27.64s)]
*  According to the committee to protect journalists the 224 days since October 7th have been the deadliest period for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=30.3s)]
*  journalists since the organization began collecting data in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=37.86s)]
*  1992 by the CPJ's count at least [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=41.82s)]
*  105 journalists and media workers have been killed in the war since it began on October 7th [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=45.5s)]
*  100 of them are [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=51.7s)]
*  Palestinian and in this context regular people have become a rare window into life inside the Gaza Strip [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=53.62s)]
*  Doctors have taken it upon themselves to film the condition of their hospitals [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=61.46s)]
*  They've recorded their own video testimony about mass civilian casualties orphaned children and having to perform surgeries without anesthetic [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=64.98s)]
*  There are a handful of remarkable accounts owned by Palestinian civilians who aren't journalists by trade [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=73.18s)]
*  But who taken it upon themselves to document their lives in a war zone for instance [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=78.86s)]
*  Two teenage boys have started to gain a following of their own [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  Posting day in the life videos from their al bala where they are currently living and evacuating from their family homes in northern [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=86.82s)]
*  Gaza at the start of the war [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  Last month Omar and Mohammed who are 18 and 19 years old began posting videos on Instagram of their daily routine in a war zone [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=97.06s)]
*  Day one of sharing our daily routine in war zone. Hi, this is Mohammed and this is Omar [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=105.42s)]
*  We are from Gaza inside the war and currently we are doing our mini business and an initiative for children [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=110.66s)]
*  The boys explained that they went to college for about a week before the war broke out and that they haven't been back to school since [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=119.86s)]
*  They want to make enough money to get themselves and their families out of Gaza to be safe and to finish their higher education [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  So they set up a couple of mini businesses where they sell e-sims and even rent out video games [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=130.54s)]
*  They also run a small chess club for kids in the refugee camp [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=136.1s)]
*  Many of their videos feature little kids in the refugee camps playing chess or dancing they put on a display [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=139.82s)]
*  Some of the difficult realities of war, but they also make jokes. They play soccer and they sing in the street [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=146.5s)]
*  Day 17 of sharing our daily routine in war zone [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=152.98s)]
*  Day 29 of sharing our daily routine in war zone [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=156.02s)]
*  And I see people excited around because they say maybe a ceasefire would be declared at the end of the day [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=158.02s)]
*  So I don't know pray for us [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=162.58s)]
*  What do you want to do when the war is over? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=164.58s)]
*  I want to go to the toilet [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=166.58s)]
*  Day 29 of sharing our daily routine in war zone [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=168.58s)]
*  And look how crazy is that queue on the bakery because of the lack of flour people are fighting and struggling to find bread [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=172.58s)]
*  Then we saw a barber who is serving a customer haircut in the street and Omar was going to receive a flower [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  But the honor of a station was closed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=185.02s)]
*  So because of the evacuation from the fa the intense population in Dar al-bala caused this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  Pollution and the sewage system is broken that will cause the illness and spread of bugs around here [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=192.18s)]
*  Then we went to the beach and found everyone was relaxing on the beach and there's some people who was playing football [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=198.06s)]
*  So we decided to join them [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=204.18s)]
*  Now [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=206.18s)]
*  After a few weeks of posting these videos Omar and Muhammad received an influx of comments from people expressing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=210.18s)]
*  Disbelief about their positive attitudes even some people commenting that life doesn't look so bad [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=215.82s)]
*  Some expressing doubts about the impact of the war Omar and Muhammad posted a video in response [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=220.82s)]
*  When the offer started we were forced to evacuate and leave our home unfortunately my relatives in the same home [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  We used to live I couldn't come I couldn't find a place to evacuate [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=235.58s)]
*  Most of them were killed and some of them survived with a horrific disabilities and injuries on my last birthday [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=240.46s)]
*  I remember that both of my parents were out of the city and I was by my own [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  That's what Hamza my friend remembered my birthday and decided to surprise me in the class [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=251.3s)]
*  Cake and surprise me. I wanted to show Hamza how much love I owe to him [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  I wanted to surprise him back in his birthday. Hamza was killed in Gaza [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=263.38s)]
*  I've been to refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey on the Syrian border in both cases and to the sites of school shootings and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=270.78s)]
*  aftermaths of disasters and two things are always true [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  There is horror and there are also people trying to find beauty or even respite in life [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  People under threat and pressure strive for normalcy well beyond the point that it is reasonable to believe that there is any [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  Normalcy to be found and that is the strength of the human condition [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=294.02s)]
*  People try to find a laugh or a smile a moment of rest and enjoyment even if they know this may be their last day [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=298.73999999999995s)]
*  On earth they still try to find something that keeps them human [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=304.78s)]
*  But that strength of the human spirit doesn't undercut how bad things actually are on the ground in Gaza [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=309.34s)]
*  One of Omar and Mohammed's videos shows them playing soccer with no commentary about the war the caption reads simply [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=316.7s)]
*  Despite the hardships and the struggles at the end of the day. We are humans [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=323.2s)]
*  We are trying to live [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=328.66s)]
*  You [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z804-cBO0yo&t=346.06s)]
