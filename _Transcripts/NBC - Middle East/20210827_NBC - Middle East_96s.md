**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAfbzujNgpU)
*  Let's talk about diplomacy with the Taliban. First of all, do you think every effort should be made to leave a diplomatic corps in Afghanistan? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAfbzujNgpU&t=0.0s)]

I think that they want to see that they have some sense of credibility or something of that nature. You know, they're dependent upon foreign countries as far as their economy is concerned. So we still will have some leverage on them. So we'll see how that goes. You know, I'm reminded some when I look at it today, you know, we didn't like the government that was moving into Afghanistan.
