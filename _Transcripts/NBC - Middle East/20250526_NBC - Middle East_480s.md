# MSF doctor: Aid entering Gaza “woefully” inadequate
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg)
*  Dr. Elat El-Najjar is a pediatrician in Gaza. She spends her days moving between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=0.0s)]
*  the last functioning hospitals treating children who have lost limbs and lives [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=5.88s)]
*  in Israeli airstrikes. On Friday she received the news that nine of her [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=10.24s)]
*  children were killed in an Israeli airstrike on her home. And a warning to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=14.64s)]
*  you, the images that we are about to show are graphic. Right now only two of her [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=18.96s)]
*  family members are still alive. Her husband and her son Adam. Both are in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=23.3s)]
*  critical condition. The rest of her children, all under the age of 13, one not even a year old, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=29.52s)]
*  are in these body bags that you see on your screen. While she was out saving [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=34.32s)]
*  lives, an Israeli airstrike killed nine of her children. The Israeli military [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=39.52s)]
*  saying that the strike targeted several suspects identified at a building near [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=44.8s)]
*  where ground troops were operating and that Haen Unis is a dangerous combat [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  zone from which civilians had been ordered to evacuate. But an important [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=52.36s)]
*  point just back in April, that very same area was labeled a safe zone. Joining us [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=56.4s)]
*  now is Dr. Aqsa Durrani, a physician and board member of Doctors Without Borders. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=61.6s)]
*  She just returned from volunteering in Gaza three weeks ago where she mainly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=65.8s)]
*  treated children and women injured by Israeli airstrikes. You spent more than [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=70.08s)]
*  two months there. Great to have you here. Thank you so much for joining us. Let's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=74.4s)]
*  start with what is actually happening now on the ground. Starvation, as we've [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=78.5s)]
*  said, a lack of aid, malnutrition, hundreds of Palestinians killed some on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=82.84s)]
*  a daily basis. Doctors Without Borders, your organization, called that aid [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  announcement that Israel is starting to let in some aid, a smoke screen, to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=94.36s)]
*  pretend that the siege is over. And I want to play for you what Israeli [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=99.0s)]
*  Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had to say as well about the aid. Take a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  listen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=105.64s)]
*  As somebody who just returned from Gaza, I want you to comment on the trickling of aid that is coming in and whether or not there's an ulterior motive for the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=112.84s)]
*  behind it as people have criticized the Israeli government for using aid to kind of deflect the criticism that they're facing internationally. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=142.84s)]
*  Amen. The aid that has entered in the last few days is woefully inadequate. We have seen that the number of trucks allowed in has just been a fraction of the number that were allowed prior to the war. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=149.84s)]
*  And, you know, it's just a distraction. It truly is just a distraction because we still have staff members who are only eating one meal a day. We still have children who are being injured at food distribution sites because they're so crowded and there are so many people that are waiting that they get burned by the jostling of the hot food. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=167.24s)]
*  The amount of aid that has been allowed in is not adequate. It is absolutely not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=189.24s)]
*  Do you think there's an ulterior motive here on the part of the Israelis to concentrate the Palestinian population in the southern part of Gaza? I mean, the prime minister said that they want to reoccupy and retake full control of Gaza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=195.24s)]
*  And people are saying that aid is being weaponized by putting it in the southern part. You're forcing the entire population to migrate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=206.24s)]
*  What we have seen is that this plan is consistent with their plan to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip. Our organization has said over and over that what we are witnessing, our medical witnessing, has been consistent with what other human rights organizations have labeled as consistent with ethnic cleansing and with genocide. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=212.24s)]
*  And the instrumentalization of aid to lure a population to a particular part of the Strip is just one aspect of the cruelty of this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=235.24s)]
*  Dr. Durrani, can you take us into your work? What your day to day was like there, the kinds of injuries that you had to treat, the conversations that you had with your patients? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=248.24s)]
*  Yeah. So I worked in a trauma field hospital where I took care of, it was actually not a pediatric hospital, but the primary patients that we had were women and children. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=258.24s)]
*  These patients were only injured from airstrikes, fires that resulted from airstrikes, cooking accidents that were the result of cooking over an open flame, or these burns that I mentioned at the food distribution sites. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=272.24s)]
*  The hundreds of patients that I saw in the two months that I was there would not have needed treatment if it were not for this systematic annihilation and bombardment and indiscriminate targeting of people by the Israeli state. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=288.24s)]
*  So in my day to day, what I was seeing was that we have our health care workers, our Palestinian colleagues who are the doctors and nurses who are providing care to their community are themselves hungry and facing forced displacement and themselves facing bombardment. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=304.24s)]
*  I had an ICU doctor who was injured in an airstrike and came the same day to provide care to our patients. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=326.24s)]
*  They are caring for their community in a time when their decisions that they're making every day to come to work, that they may never see their family again. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=333.24s)]
*  That when they are walking through, you know, 80% of the Gaza Strip, according to the United Nations, is now under either evacuation order or is militarized. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=343.24s)]
*  So when they're walking to work, they are risking that they may never see their children again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=353.24s)]
*  They are, you know, the weight that they're bearing is unspeakable. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=358.24s)]
*  And I think that what we the in terms of conversations with my patients, it was just that patient people are exhausted. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=366.24s)]
*  They need this to stop. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=374.24s)]
*  They just want it to stop. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=376.24s)]
*  Dr. Durrani, there has been a lot of attention justly so paid to malnutrition and starvation that a lot of your patients have faced. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=378.24s)]
*  My understanding is that it's also been difficult to get medications and medical supplies into the area. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=386.24s)]
*  Could you talk about how that has complicated your work? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=393.24s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=395.24s)]
*  I would say that, you know, I've done this work across decades and across continents, and this is the first time that I've ever had to ration supplies or look patients in the eye and say that I didn't have enough. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=397.24s)]
*  I didn't have something that I knew was just miles away being blocked by Israel. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=407.24s)]
*  For us, you know, having to ration food when we have burn patients, particularly children who need nutrient protein for nutrition to recover from their burns. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=413.24s)]
*  For when we have patients that have painful wounds that need dressings that need pain medications that we can't provide that we have to ration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=424.24s)]
*  It's forcing us to make unspeakable decisions. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=435.24s)]
*  And again, you know, if all of this would stop, if the indiscriminate killing and maiming of people in Gaza would stop. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=440.24s)]
*  Dr. Durrani, thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=449.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for your work, and we appreciate you joining with us. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=451.24s)]
*  We know it's not safe to be an aid worker in these conditions, so we thankfully have you here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=454.24s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=459.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ItQ9UTCsg&t=465.24s)]
