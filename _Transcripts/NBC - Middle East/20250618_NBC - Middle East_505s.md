# Israeli Amb. to U.S.: ‘This is a battle where we don’t have a second chance’
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU)
*  Joining us now is a key player in all of this, Israel's ambassador to the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael Leiter. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=4.84s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for being on the program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=5.84s)]
*  What can you tell us about the conversations between your government and the U.S. government, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=8.84s)]
*  Trump and Netanyahu? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=13.4s)]
*  And whether you agree, we may see something key play out in the next week here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=14.82s)]
*  Oh, Chris, good afternoon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=20.2s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=22.04s)]
*  Exactly the discussions that take place with the two governments I couldn't really share [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=24.62s)]
*  on television. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  But I can tell you this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  We've asked for a defensive posture, and we've been privileged to receive from the administration, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  President Trump, Congress, support in the way of THAAD and Aegis missiles that have [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  saved many Israeli lives with these ballistic missiles cruising in from Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=42.68s)]
*  They've been tremendously effective alongside of our defense missile systems. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=48.92s)]
*  And we hope and pray that we can continue to pursue our goal of defanging Iran from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=52.92s)]
*  a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=59.04s)]
*  So what does that exactly look like? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=61.04s)]
*  What is the end game here? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=63.28s)]
*  The end game is that we have an Iran that either chooses or is prevented from achieving [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=66.08s)]
*  enriched uranium to the point where they can create a nuclear bomb, where they have ballistic [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=74.08s)]
*  missiles. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=79.36s)]
*  You know, these missiles are like school buses packed with TNT that fly through the air and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=80.36s)]
*  cause death and destruction on a massive scale. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  So they have a production plan for some 300 of these ballistic missiles a month, 3,500 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=89.72s)]
*  a year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=96.32s)]
*  And the Supreme Leader has been quoted as saying, you know, what are these Israelis [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  going to do if we fire thousands of these ballistic missiles all at once but die? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  So we're not going to die for this confrontation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=106.96s)]
*  It's a to be or not to be issue. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  And the important point to emphasize is this is not a war that began last Thursday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=114.4s)]
*  This is a war that's been going on for decades. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=119.0s)]
*  And what we have embarked upon is a war to end this endless war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal cited four sources familiar with discussions, Mr. Ambassador, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  reporting Israel presented evidence to the U.S. just last week purporting to show that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Iran was doing new research that was useful to building a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=136.56s)]
*  The U.S. didn't buy it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  That the consensus view among American intel agencies is that Iran hasn't decided to move [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=142.36s)]
*  forward on building a bomb. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has claimed for years that Iran was weeks away from a bomb. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=151.96s)]
*  What evidence does Israel have that made an escalation necessary now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=156.4s)]
*  Well, we didn't make the escalation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=162.44s)]
*  The escalation has been made by Iran a year and a half ago when it sent its proxy Hamas [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=166.6s)]
*  to storm across southern Israel and slaughter 1200 of our civilians. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  And if they could do that throughout Israel, they'd do the same thing they did in October 7th. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=175.16s)]
*  Look, apparently the president had different intel because when he wrote a letter to the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  Supreme Leader 65 days ago, he said you've got 60 days to make a deal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=183.92s)]
*  Now if he thought that they were years away from a nuclear bomb, I guess he wouldn't have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=189.48s)]
*  limited to 60 days. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=194.76s)]
*  And indeed, when it comes to our intel, and that's what we've got to follow, they were very, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=195.92s)]
*  very close to a bomb. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=201.68s)]
*  And the fact that's been going on for years means that at some point, cumulatively, it adds up. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=203.0s)]
*  And there is indeed a bomb. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=207.96s)]
*  We don't have a second chance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=209.24s)]
*  We can't take any chances as far as that's concerned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=210.52s)]
*  We have to make sure that we're going to stay alive. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=213.76s)]
*  They call us a one bomb country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=216.64s)]
*  So we have to act in our self-defense. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=218.88s)]
*  And it was after the 60 days the president gave them that expired. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  It was after an IAEA report, which is a damning report, vindicating what our prime minister has [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=225.28s)]
*  been saying for 15 years, that they're on the cusp of achieving a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  So all of that taken into account together, we had to act, and we're acting now to end this war [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  that Iran has been conducting against Israel and the West. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=242.88s)]
*  I mean, let's not forget, they sent assassination teams to take out the president of the United [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=246.04s)]
*  States. They sent assassination teams to kill your former secretary of state Pompeo, to kill John Bolton. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=251.52s)]
*  They've killed hundreds of Americans. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=259.12s)]
*  They chant death to America in the Times Square and Tehran. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=261.36s)]
*  So this is a battle that we don't have a second chance. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=265.2s)]
*  We've got to finish this war, to end this war. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=268.6s)]
*  So when you talk about the options of Iran either choosing or being prevented from developing, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=273.2s)]
*  from becoming a nuclear power, in several recent interviews, you seem to suggest that Israel's goal [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=279.52s)]
*  is bigger than just eliminating the nuclear program. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=284.8s)]
*  It's regime change. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=287.48s)]
*  And in fact, yesterday you said, quote, if the Iranian people rise up and say, we've had enough of this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=288.8s)]
*  government, then if we facilitate that, we'll have done something good for history. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=294.68s)]
*  How far is Israel willing to go to make that happen? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=300.4s)]
*  Chris, we're not in the business of regime change. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=304.88s)]
*  I said that if, as a result of our self-defense, the people rise up, which they've done repeatedly, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=307.6s)]
*  the problem is that this regime of tyrants has shot them in the back. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=313.6s)]
*  You know, there's 15,000 political prisoners imprisoned by the Ayatollahs in Tehran. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=318.64s)]
*  So we're very, very clear with our objective, and that's to prevent a nuclear Iran. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=325.24s)]
*  If, as a result of our activities, the Iranian people find the opportunity to race towards freedom [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=330.92s)]
*  instead of a nuclear bomb, then so be it, and we will have done something good for humanity. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  So recent history suggests that when regimes fall, even bad ones, what comes next isn't necessarily better. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=343.16s)]
*  So if Israel, in some way, whatever you do, leads to the toppling of the Iranian government, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=349.6s)]
*  is there a plan for the day after, the weeks after, the months after? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=356.04s)]
*  You know, we can't make plans for the Iranian people. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=361.92s)]
*  The Iranian people are glorious people with a very long civilizational history. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=365.48s)]
*  But you know, the paradigm that you just described is hardly accurate. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=369.68s)]
*  We brought down the Hezbollah-dominated government in Lebanon by targeting Hezbollah. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=375.56s)]
*  We now have a ceasefire with a new Lebanese government under the direction of General Aoun, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=382.68s)]
*  which is actually disarming the Hezbollah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=388.72s)]
*  So Hezbollah no longer has control of Lebanon, and there is a solid government in favor of a normalization with Israel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=392.0s)]
*  In Syria, because we brought down Hezbollah, who could have imagined a year ago that the Assad government [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=399.68s)]
*  wouldn't be in power, a government that was favored and supported complementarily with Iran? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=406.12s)]
*  And now there's a leader of Syria who's talking about living in a normalized state with Israel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=413.56s)]
*  So this idea of, you know, if regimes fall, somebody worse is going to come into existence is hardly accurate. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  But again, our focus is not on regime change. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=426.04s)]
*  The Iranian people have to focus on regime change. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  We're focusing on defending and protecting our lives. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me add, we're out of time, Ambassador Lawyer, but do you very briefly believe that a diplomatic solution is still possible? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  At this point, it's hard to see. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=443.48s)]
*  We always hope that diplomacy will work. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  But the Iranians have been playing with this diplomacy now for many years, and they've been pulling the West along. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=450.92s)]
*  And I can only quote the words of German Chancellor Mertz, who said this morning that he compliments Israel for doing the work that he should be doing, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  the rest of the world should be doing, as the world is going to compliment Israel for doing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  Ambassador Lider, thank you so much. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=471.48s)]
*  I should just say that the IDF is reporting that missiles have been launched from Iran heading toward Israel. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=473.16s)]
*  That is the latest update. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for your time. It's much appreciated. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. Good afternoon. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBBvYKE3vU&t=483.92s)]
