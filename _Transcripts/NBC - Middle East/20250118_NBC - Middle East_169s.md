# Netanyahu says Hamas needs to provide names of hostages or risk more fighting
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc)
*  Ralph, last hour Netanyahu gave his first address to the nation since the announcement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=0.0s)]
*  of the ceasefire agreement overnight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=4.24s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=6.42s)]
*  So Alex, at this point we are less than 12 hours from when this ceasefire is supposed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=10.8s)]
*  to begin and we are kind of in limbo because Netanyahu said that Hamas has not provided [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=15.6s)]
*  the list of the three female hostages who are due to be released tomorrow. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=21.32s)]
*  And he's saying that if Hamas does not abide by this agreement, it is not going to go forward. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=27.44s)]
*  So there are a lot of anxious people here in Hostage Square who have been gathering [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=33.08s)]
*  for 15 months now demanding the release of the hostages. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  They are hoping that that is going to begin tomorrow, but there is an uncertainty hanging [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=41.04s)]
*  over this all right now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu also talked about the role that both the present administration under President [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=48.52s)]
*  Biden, but also the incoming administration under President Trump played in bringing this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=54.96s)]
*  deal about. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=60.44s)]
*  Take a listen to what he had to say. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=61.44s)]
*  Both President Trump and President Biden have provided full backing to Israel's right to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=64.92s)]
*  resume fighting, to resume combat if Israel reaches the conclusion that the negotiations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=71.16s)]
*  over the second stage are pointless. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=76.84s)]
*  I truly appreciate that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=79.8s)]
*  I also appreciate the decision of President Trump to lift all the remaining restrictions [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=81.48s)]
*  on the providing of essential munitions and weapons to the state of Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=86.92s)]
*  If we need to resume combat, we will do so in new ways and we will do so with tremendous [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=92.44s)]
*  force. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu talked about resuming combat there, and that has a lot of people very worried [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  because as you know, Alex, in this first phase of the deal, it is only 33 of those [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=109.48s)]
*  98 hostages who are due to come out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu has said repeatedly in public and in private that he is not prepared to end [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  this war, and that raises real questions about whether he is going to be willing to go from [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  phase one of this deal, that six week ceasefire to phase two, which would see the war ending [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=129.36s)]
*  in its entirety and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=136.32s)]
*  So many, many questions hanging over this agreement right now, and as I said, less than [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=140.84s)]
*  12 hours until it is due to go into effect. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=145.88s)]
*  Alex. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=148.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknsXR6hoNc&t=165.32s)]
