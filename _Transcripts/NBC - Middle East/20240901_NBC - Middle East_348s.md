# Sen. Stabenow on hostage deaths: ‘it just reaffirms that Hamas are barbarians’
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o)
*  Tomorrow, Vice President Kamala Harris will make a pitch to voters in two key swing states, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=0.0s)]
*  Michigan and Pennsylvania. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=6.04s)]
*  The focus on Labor Day is laying out her plan to strengthen the middle class. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=7.8s)]
*  President Biden will join his VP at a campaign event in Pittsburgh after she makes a stop [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=11.72s)]
*  in Detroit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=16.5s)]
*  Harris plans to meet with labor leaders, outlining her agenda to put more Americans to work in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=17.68s)]
*  higher-paid jobs, and also to paint a clear contrast against Donald Trump's economic plan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=22.8s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is the Democratic Senator of Michigan, Debbie Stabenow. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=28.08s)]
*  Good morning, Senator. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=33.28s)]
*  Before we get into the politics of the President's visit, we wanted to get your thoughts, if [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=34.48s)]
*  we could, on the killing of six hostages, including one American by Hamas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=40.28s)]
*  The President has issued a statement condemning the act, as has the Vice President. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=47.76s)]
*  What are your thoughts at this moment, given these events? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=54.74s)]
*  Well, Michael, first, it's great to be with you, and, Simone, I really appreciate your [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=58.34s)]
*  show. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=64.66s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=65.66s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is horrible, and it just reaffirms that Hamas are barbarians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=66.66s)]
*  And it also reaffirms that we need to stop this war. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=73.78s)]
*  I mean, there are too many innocent people, whether it's Israelis, Israeli hostages, Palestinian, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=77.3s)]
*  innocent citizens. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=85.22s)]
*  It all needs to stop. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  And that's, you know, my heart goes out to everyone who is part of losing those six hostages. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  But this whole thing needs to stop. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=99.3s)]
*  You know, Senator, obviously, Michigan is on the mind of both the Trump and the Harris [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=103.78s)]
*  campaign. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=110.5s)]
*  When you talk about the issue of the Middle East, specifically what is happening, this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=112.18s)]
*  war between Israel and Hamas, and the effects on both the Israeli people and the Palestinian [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=116.98s)]
*  people living in the Gaza Strip, Michigan also always comes up in that conversation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=122.42s)]
*  I know tomorrow the focus will be labor leaders and workers and the American economy, but I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=127.14s)]
*  have to imagine that this is also a potential topic that the Vice President will hear about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=132.9s)]
*  while she's in the state. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=138.66s)]
*  Well, certainly, this is something that's on the hearts and minds of everybody in Michigan. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  So I'm certain, as she has already, she will be open to listening and having conversations [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=146.33999999999997s)]
*  and speaking out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=153.06s)]
*  Tomorrow will be very exciting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=155.14s)]
*  You know, we've had presidents and presidential candidates coming to the Labor Day parade in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=158.66s)]
*  Detroit for decades and decades. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=163.54s)]
*  In fact, John F. Kennedy announced his run for president in 1960 at the Detroit Labor [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=166.66s)]
*  Day parade. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=173.54s)]
*  And so this is something we have a lot of pride and history in. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  We believe with the organizing that's going on in Michigan and Detroit for decades and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=179.7s)]
*  decades that we really created the middle class by creating the union movement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=184.73999999999998s)]
*  And people are very excited about her coming tomorrow. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=190.1s)]
*  Senator, Simone raised the impact and the focus of workers and jobs and opportunity. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=194.26s)]
*  The other big issue that I know will resonate and is resonating, particularly with younger [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=202.26s)]
*  voters out there, is housing, is renting, being able to rent a place to stay, to sleep at [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=207.94s)]
*  night. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  You have a new ad out by the Harris Walls campaign. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on it real quick. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=217.22s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=218.98s)]
*  For most of my childhood, we were renters. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=224.5s)]
*  I was a teenager when that day finally came. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  And I can remember so well how excited she was. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=231.38s)]
*  I know what home ownership means. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=235.06s)]
*  And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=238.26s)]
*  I know what home ownership means. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=247.06s)]
*  Tell us your thoughts of the impact of this messaging, particularly for young voters in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=254.82s)]
*  Well, Michael, from my perspective, because I hear about housing all the time, whether [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=256.26s)]
*  it's young people trying to buy the first home or somebody trying to get that down payment [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=260.82s)]
*  so they can finally get into a home, a safe place for their children, this has been an [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=266.02s)]
*  issue that, in my mind, has not been focused on enough. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=270.82s)]
*  And I love the fact that our vice president is lifting it up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=274.1s)]
*  I also love the fact she's going to be in Detroit, where our mayor, Mike Duggan, and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=277.86s)]
*  the Detroit community, both public and private sector, put together the $25,000 down payment [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  program for people in Detroit to be able to get into a home. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=291.06s)]
*  And we know that so many people, they can afford the rent every month. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=294.66s)]
*  They can afford it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=298.18s)]
*  It's just saving up the money to get the down payment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=298.82s)]
*  So we're excited in Detroit that she has lifted up a very successful Detroit program to make [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=302.58s)]
*  a part of her platform. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=310.74s)]
*  Senator Debbie Stavano of Michigan, thank you for sharing your thoughts on the tragic [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=313.86s)]
*  events in the Middle East and giving us a preview of what's coming to your great state [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  with the Carers campaign tomorrow. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=324.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=326.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnPTxfOu0o&t=332.26s)]
