# U.S. Hits ISIS Target In Afghanistan With "Over-The-Horizon" Drone Strike: DOD
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI)
*  We've got some breaking news for you right now that we just just received word. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just going to read this to you verbatim. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The following statement is attributable to Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=8.6s)]
*  Command. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=14.4s)]
*  U.S. military forces have conducted an over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation today against an [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=15.4s)]
*  ISIS-K planner. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=21.28s)]
*  The unmanned airstrike occurred in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=23.68s)]
*  Afghanistan, Nangarhar province, is in far eastern Afghanistan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=28.28s)]
*  The capital of Nangarhar province is Jalalabad, which is probably a city that you've heard [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=30.64s)]
*  of. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=34.08s)]
*  Back to the statement from CENTCOM. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=35.36s)]
*  Initial indications are that we killed the target. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=37.24s)]
*  We know of no civilian casualties. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=39.92s)]
*  Again, this is breaking news. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=42.2s)]
*  This has just come out within the last couple of minutes from U.S. Central Command. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=43.68s)]
*  This is the only information that we've got at this point. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  This comes following a few recent developments that may be relevant here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=52.2s)]
*  Biden said in pointed terms yesterday in his evening address to the nation, his late afternoon [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=57.44s)]
*  address to the nation, that the U.S. would hunt down the people responsible for that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=61.8s)]
*  bombing yesterday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=65.6s)]
*  We will find you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=66.6s)]
*  We will make you pay. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=67.6s)]
*  He said that he had directed U.S. military commanders to develop a plan to strike back [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=69.52s)]
*  at ISIS-K, ISIS in the Khorasan, the ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan that claimed responsibility [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=74.64s)]
*  for the attack at Kabul airport. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=79.58s)]
*  We did just moments before we got in the air tonight, we did get a new pointed warning [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=81.58s)]
*  from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul advising U.S. citizens to leave the airport vicinity immediately. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=87.52s)]
*  This was the same sort of warning from the U.S. Embassy that proceeded by a matter of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=94.24s)]
*  hours the last ISIS-K attack at the Kabul airport that killed so many Afghan civilians [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=97.78s)]
*  and 13 U.S. service members. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=104.0s)]
*  But again, after that attack, after the warnings of that attack from U.S. officials, after [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  the attack happened, after President Biden said that we would find those responsible [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  and make them pay and that he was telling U.S. military commanders to come up with a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  plan for doing so, after another very pointed warning of another potential attack tonight, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=119.56s)]
*  again just in the last few minutes, the U.S. military saying that they tracked down and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  killed a planner. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=130.92s)]
*  Presumably the contention here is that this is one of the planners behind the Kabul airport [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=132.8s)]
*  attack. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Again, this is breaking news just happening right now, helping us to understand. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  Joining us by phone, I believe, is NBC News correspondent covering national security in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  the Pentagon, our own Courtney Kuby. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=145.66000000000003s)]
*  Courtney, thanks for joining us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=147.78s)]
*  I know this is breaking right now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=149.38000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=150.94s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=151.94s)]
*  So we know a little bit more about this, Rachel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=152.94000000000003s)]
*  At this point, this was someone who was an ISIS planner and involved in planning for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=157.74s)]
*  future attacks by ISIS. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=164.18s)]
*  The individual was riding in a vehicle at the time of this drone strike. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=166.28s)]
*  The U.S. military is confident that they took out this person. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=171.52s)]
*  Apparently he was with some sort of an associate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  They're saying that right now they don't have any reports of civilian casualties in this, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=178.08s)]
*  that in fact they were in a vehicle and they were in an isolated area at the time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  So this occurred in Nangarhar province, which is on the eastern part of Afghanistan, east [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=186.72s)]
*  of Kabul. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=190.84s)]
*  And it's an area that's been known to have an ISIS-K presence for several years now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=191.98s)]
*  In fact, it's an area where there has been a lot of fighting between ISIS-K and the Taliban, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=196.54s)]
*  believe it or not. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=202.38s)]
*  So it's not a surprise that that would be where they might find someone who would be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  involved in the planning or the command and control or some of them in more of a leadership [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=207.66s)]
*  position of ISIS. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  There's not a big ISIS presence overall in all of Afghanistan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  It's estimated to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 to maybe as much as 1200 total fighters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=217.82s)]
*  But what we've learned from just this week is with just a small number of fighters, ISIS [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=223.92s)]
*  can carry out a spectacular attack and a very deadly attack, like we saw at Kabul airport [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=230.2s)]
*  yesterday, Rachel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=235.32s)]
*  Courtney, there's been a lot of discussion in recent weeks as to whether or not the U.S. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=236.32s)]
*  would maintain offensive capacity in Afghanistan even after withdrawal of U.S. troops and President [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=240.92s)]
*  Biden has spoken very confidently about an over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=247.28s)]
*  to strike counterterrorism, to strike terrorist targets at America's choosing and a time [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=253.7s)]
*  and place of our choosing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=259.64s)]
*  What do we know about the over-the-horizon nature of this attack? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=261.46s)]
*  You described it as a drone strike. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=265.1s)]
*  Is this the sort of thing that could have been done with no U.S. troops inside Afghanistan [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=267.32s)]
*  or is this the sort of drone strike for which it mattered that there were U.S. troops on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=272.12s)]
*  the ground? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=275.92s)]
*  So this was part of that across-the-horizon presence that you mentioned or over-the-horizon [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=277.56s)]
*  presence. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=282.56s)]
*  So basically what that will look like is the U.S. will have a number of air assets, largely [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=283.56s)]
*  unmanned, so drones, that will be parked in a couple of neighboring areas. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=291.0s)]
*  And when they haveâthere is a presence, a U.S. military presence still in the country [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=296.36s)]
*  Now there's about 5,400 troops at Kabul airport, but they're not really gathering intelligence [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=303.08s)]
*  in the same way that the U.S.âwhen the U.S. had even the 2,500 troops in there, you know, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=308.96s)]
*  only a month or two ago before the drawdown was really completed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=315.52s)]
*  The troops who are at Kabul airport, they're focused on one mission, and that's this evacuation [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=320.54s)]
*  and maintaining security around the airport. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=324.04s)]
*  People may be surprised to know that prior to the drawdown, when the U.S. still had a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=327.48s)]
*  presence, more of a larger presence in Afghanistan, they shared a lot of intelligence with the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=333.36s)]
*  Afghans, and the Afghan military actually provided a lot of intelligence on groups like [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=338.44s)]
*  ISIS-K. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=343.8s)]
*  That's one of the things that will be lost in the loss of this U.S. military presence [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=344.8s)]
*  and in the Taliban takeover. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=349.32s)]
*  The Afghan military no longer exists for all intents and purposes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=351.48s)]
*  The U.S. no longer has them as a partner to gather and share intelligence with. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=354.56s)]
*  Now the U.S. will have to rely onâand they also won't have the human intelligence [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=358.76s)]
*  forces that they had on the ground. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=363.44s)]
*  So now the U.S. is really going to have to rely on overhead, some signals intelligence, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=364.44s)]
*  that's intercept, satellite constellations. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=368.68s)]
*  They have the ability to get things from overhead, but it's nowhere near the same picture that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=375.32s)]
*  they used to have. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=379.08s)]
*  I guess the short way of saying it is they still have eyes on, but the picture is much [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=380.28s)]
*  blurrier than it was six months or even a year ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  And Courtney, are we expecting that thisâagain, what you're describing as a drone strike [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  on a vehicle carrying a man said to be an ISIS-K planner involved in planning for future [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=395.08s)]
*  attacks? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=401.11999999999995s)]
*  It's a pretty specific description about what the Pentagon says happened in Nagerhar [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=402.11999999999995s)]
*  province tonight. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=407.08s)]
*  Do we expect that this is an opening act? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=409.36s)]
*  Do we expect that this is standalone? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=414.2s)]
*  Should we expect there to be additional attacks like this, additional targets? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=416.44s)]
*  So, there are likely additional targets that exist, that the Pentagon is continuing to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=420.92s)]
*  develop. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=427.12s)]
*  But in a case like this, this is going to end up being a policy decision out of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=428.12s)]
*  White House. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  They're going to have to make the decision how they want to respond to this attack in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  Kabul airport yesterday. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=436.92s)]
*  And this is a very realâwhat we are hearing about tonight is a direct retaliation for [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  what occurred at Kabul airport. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=444.24s)]
*  The U.S. has not been regularly taking counterterror strikes in Afghanistan. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  In fact, the last one we know about was in February of 2020, a year and a half ago. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  So this is a very direct retaliation for what happened at Kabul airport. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=455.64s)]
*  The Biden administration is going to have to make a decision about how they want to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=459.36s)]
*  respond. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=463.72s)]
*  Do they want to take out something like this that is a retaliation? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=465.56s)]
*  It may have an impact on future planning and future operations, but this isn't going to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  decapitate ISIS in any way in that country. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  This is aâit's a response. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=479.32000000000005s)]
*  It sends a signal. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=481.16s)]
*  It sends a message. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=482.16s)]
*  Or do they want to do something bigger? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=483.16s)]
*  Do they want to do something that would really have an impact on ISIS operations going forward? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=485.24s)]
*  And the next big question they're going to have to answer is, do they want to makeâif [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  they want to make a bigger splash here, do they want to do it while there's still 5,000 [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=494.23999999999995s)]
*  U.S. troops on the ground there? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  Or do they want to wait? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=499.32s)]
*  U.S. troops are still on track for a full withdrawal by August 31st. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=500.32s)]
*  It's a couple of days away. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  But again, you know, one thing that viewers should know is it is very clear that this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=506.4s)]
*  specific strike tonight, this specific drone strike, is a direct retaliation against ISIS-K [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=511.12s)]
*  for the attack at Kabul airport yesterday. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=518.76s)]
*  Kori, let me just ask you one last question. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=521.52s)]
*  Looking at this map while we are speaking, I'm struck by the location of Nagar province [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=523.4799999999999s)]
*  and the fact that it's a border province right up against the Pakistan border. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=527.4s)]
*  So much of the strategy and the difficulty of fighting this war against the Taliban and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  other extremist militants in Afghanistan over all these years has been the porousness of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  that border and indeed the support in Pakistan for so many of the fighters who sought refuge [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=545.48s)]
*  there and essentially were able to refuel, resupply and shelter there, even while there [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=551.84s)]
*  were tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Afghanistan looking for them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=557.4s)]
*  Is this the sort of thing happening in that part of eastern Afghanistan that the U.S. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=561.6s)]
*  talks to Pakistan about, that they have to de-conflict with Pakistan about, or that might [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=567.12s)]
*  create a diplomatic situation with that country? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=570.08s)]
*  So as long as they're staying on the Afghan side of the border, they don't generally de-conflict [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=574.16s)]
*  any of these kinds of operations. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=578.92s)]
*  What's going to be difficult going forward here is the fact that the Taliban have now [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=581.16s)]
*  taken over Afghanistan and they are in many cases, particularly in Kabul right now, they [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=586.04s)]
*  are aligning with the Haqqani network. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=592.92s)]
*  The Haqqani network, another terror group, they have very strong ties to the Pakistani [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=595.2s)]
*  intelligence services, the ISI. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=600.16s)]
*  So now that the government is going to be very intertwined with Pakistan, it's going [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=602.64s)]
*  to be once again a crossroads for the Pakistani government and the U.S. relations. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  Will Pakistan help the U.S.? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=614.64s)]
*  Will they be a partner or will they align more with the Taliban and then potentially [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=617.68s)]
*  other nefarious groups, al-Qaeda and others? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, if history, if the most recent history is any, gives us any signal of what might [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  happen here, in many cases, the Pakistani, particularly the intelligence services, have [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=634.44s)]
*  not aligned with the United States. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=638.72s)]
*  They have aligned with the Haqqani network and others. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=640.0400000000001s)]
*  Just to give you a sense of something that I'm sure that our viewers are very well aware [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  of, the Bin Laden raid that was launched actually out of Nangarhar province, out of Jalalabad [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=648.44s)]
*  into Pakistan. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=655.32s)]
*  And as we all know, the Pakistanis were not given any kind of a heads up that the U.S. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=656.32s)]
*  was launching that raid. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  But again, since we're just talking about something that occurred on the Afghan side [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  of the border, most likely there was not a heads up to the Pakistanis before this happened. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=664.96s)]
*  The long-term consequences of all of these things, the way these things play out over [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  time becomes more and more opaque with all of these pieces changing, all of these dynamics [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  changing at once. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=680.0200000000001s)]
*  NBC's Courtney Kubi, thank you for joining us at Short Notice. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=681.0200000000001s)]
*  I have a feeling we'll be talking to you again as we learn more about this over the course [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=683.68s)]
*  of the night. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=686.12s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=687.12s)]
*  Again, Courtney Kubi helping us break that news, which we have just learned from a spokesman [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=688.12s)]
*  for Central Command. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=693.84s)]
*  The United States government, the United States military has retaliated for the ISIS-K, ISIS [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=694.84s)]
*  Khorasan attack on the Kabul airport yesterday. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=700.36s)]
*  That attack is said to have killed 170 to 200 Afghan civilians and 13 U.S. service members, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=704.18s)]
*  President Biden said last night that the United States would find those responsible and make [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=711.56s)]
*  them pay. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  A drone strike in eastern Afghanistan in Nangarhar province tonight has reportedly killed an [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  ISIS-K planner, according to Courtney Kubi's reporting, one involved in planning for future [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  attacks. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=727.52s)]
*  We'll have more as we learn more. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ndrubY2ZrI&t=728.52s)]
