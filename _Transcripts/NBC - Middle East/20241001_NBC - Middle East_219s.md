# U.S. report says Iran preparing imminent missile attack against Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU)
*  I want to begin with NBC's White House correspondent Monica Alba, who is with us by phone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=0.0s)]
*  But Monica, you have this breaking news reporting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=5.04s)]
*  What have you learned about this potential Iranian attack against Israel? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=7.24s)]
*  Well, Ana, this is coming from a senior White House official and a Department of Defense [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  official who confirmed to myself and to our Pentagon correspondent Courtney QB this indication [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=17.36s)]
*  that the United States has, which is typically a reflection of intelligence and information [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=24.52s)]
*  that they have gleaned from other countries who would potentially be affected by this, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=30.12s)]
*  that Iran is indeed preparing to launch that ballistic missile attack against Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=34.92s)]
*  Now, to put this into context, this is something that has happened before. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=40.64s)]
*  It happened earlier this year, as we may remember, and the U.S. was actively involved in helping [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=44.68s)]
*  Israel defend itself that time around. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm told by a senior White House official that that is the case in this scenario as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=54.04s)]
*  The U.S. says that they are actively supporting defensive preparations to help defend Israel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=59.0s)]
*  against this attack. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=63.72s)]
*  And the U.S. is warning, as they have before and in the past, that a direct military attack [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=65.24s)]
*  from Iran against Israel will, quote, carry severe consequences for Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=71.4s)]
*  Now, it's important, again, to note that this is something that administration officials [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=76.48s)]
*  had been bracing for. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=80.8s)]
*  They had been anticipating a response from Iran. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=82.0s)]
*  We knew that certainly with all of the turmoil in the last couple of weeks that this was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  something that there was going to be a big moment of anticipation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  And so that should not surprise anybody that this is where this next step could go. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=93.72s)]
*  The biggest questions now are about when exactly this could happen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=98.56s)]
*  And the fact that the United States is trying to get out and say that this could happen [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  is of its own significance. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  But also, U.S. officials have been telling us essentially that the U.S. had not seen [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=108.68s)]
*  any movement of assets or equipment in Iran to indicate that something was going to be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=114.12s)]
*  happening so quickly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=119.64s)]
*  But at the same time, they had warned that Iran, if it wanted to move quickly, could [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=120.64s)]
*  be postured to do so. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=125.48s)]
*  So we know overall when it comes to what the president has said many times and his top [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=127.56s)]
*  officials, Iran has signaled to the U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  at least recently that it does not want and does not seek a wider war. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  And certainly when the president has been asked about his own message to Iran in terms [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=139.88s)]
*  of contemplating something like this, normally the president's response is just one word [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=145.16s)]
*  and it's don't. And that warning will likely be escalated and amplified today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  But the fact that the White House and the Pentagon are relaying that this is something that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=155.4s)]
*  could happen very quickly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=160.16s)]
*  It does. It's important to mention that back in April when this occurred, there was a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=161.6s)]
*  large number of these ballistic missiles that were launched and intercepted. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=167.52s)]
*  And this was something where essentially when this took place, Israel was able to really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=173.16s)]
*  claim victory in how well its defense systems operated, as we may remember. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=180.0s)]
*  And so the question now is whether this will look like that or something different. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=185.48s)]
*  But those are the early indications from the White House. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=189.8s)]
*  And we know that the president and his national security team will be monitoring this very [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=192.24s)]
*  closely as they have been on us. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HHP9gX0VPU&t=197.32000000000002s)]
