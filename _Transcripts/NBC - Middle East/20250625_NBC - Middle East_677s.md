# Trump repeats claim Iran nuclear sites 'obliterated'
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0)
*  Let's bring in NBC News national security correspondent Courtney QB NBC News White House correspondent Monica Alba and also with us NBC International [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Raph Sanchez New York Times Pentagon [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=8.08s)]
*  Correspondent and MSNBC political analyst Helene Cooper and former deputy assistant secretary of state Joel Rubin [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  We've all been listening for the past 45 minutes Courtney [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=17.82s)]
*  Let's start with what we know and what we don't know help us break down the president's and secretary Heg sets comments on Iran's nuclear [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=20.54s)]
*  capabilities at this moment a lot of it was focused on this DIA report [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=28.9s)]
*  Yeah, and there were a couple of new things that we learned from the president there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=32.9s)]
*  He said that there's more information that has come in since that da [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=35.96s)]
*  DIA report was was first produced and and disseminated throughout the the national security apparatus [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=39.78s)]
*  One thing I was really struck by was he said that they have people on the ground presumably he's talking about Israel [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=45.8s)]
*  But any kind of acknowledgement that Israel has sent people on the ground to those three sites to do any kind of a damn [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  A damage assessment is pretty remarkable on a normally [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=59.16s)]
*  Especially if they would be some sort of intelligence assets or something there would never ever be any [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Acknowledgement of people on the ground in a hostile country [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=69.44s)]
*  Especially during a conflict like this so that was that was really striking to me another thing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=73.64s)]
*  We learned that we've been asking here at the Pentagon for the last several days and not got an answer to is a little bit [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=78.5s)]
*  More about the the bombing package that went into Iran over the weekend the United States military [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=83.16s)]
*  The president saying that there were f-22s f-35s and 52 different tankers [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  That's a new a little bit of detail about that package and then on the third thing that I was really [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=94.3s)]
*  Struck by throughout that was a theme throughout that conversation was that asking? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  Reporters asking for more clarity on the Defense Intelligence Agency's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=105.12s)]
*  Assessment of this or any additional information about the assessment about the damage that was done [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=110.16s)]
*  Not just to the infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program, but to the program itself [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=116.16s)]
*  Was met with a criticism and a complaint by the president and definitely by the Secretary of Defense [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=121.12s)]
*  That it was and it was some in some way [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=127.04s)]
*  Disparaging the men and women who were involved in the strikes and involved in this military mission [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=129.9s)]
*  Several of the reporters tried to push back on that saying that this was not in any way [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=136.18s)]
*  In any way disparaging the the mission itself which you know by all accounts [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=140.5s)]
*  They were able to get in and get out with the complete element of surprise the Iran never fired any kind of shots at them [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=146.16s)]
*  There were no aircraft down nothing like that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=153.46s)]
*  They did hit the targets that were laid out for them [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  but I was really struck by how that was a very consistent theme throughout that press conference was any questioning of whether the the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  nuclear program has been destroyed was immediately met with a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=166.9s)]
*  Dismissal and a criticism of the reporters as if they were going after the men and women in uniform at all which [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=170.74s)]
*  Anna is simply not the case in those questions [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=176.22s)]
*  I want to bring in Kelly O'Donnell who as we all saw is there at the Hague and was asking questions of the president [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=178.38s)]
*  You had a rather lengthy exchange there near the end of his press conference Kelly. What are your top takeaways from his answer? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=185.42s)]
*  Well, I think the point that Courtney was making is an important one [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=195.17999999999998s)]
*  It is a separate matter to ask about the intelligence [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  assessments after action about what was struck and that is not in any way [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=202.77999999999997s)]
*  intended as a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=208.77999999999997s)]
*  Disparagement or a diminishment of the capabilities of those who carried out the mission [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=210.28s)]
*  They're very separate things the assessments that happen after the fact and going forward are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Invaluable to the president to the Secretary of Defense and others to make decisions going forward [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=221.6s)]
*  So that's where we were trying to get the questions at least in my case [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=226.92s)]
*  They are not apparently disputing that the Defense Intelligence Agency report was out the president ultimately conceded [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  They should have waited to produce the report until there was more information as Courtney also highlighted [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=237.82s)]
*  I was also struck by the president talking about in-person on-the-ground [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=243.54s)]
*  Assessments at these sites. We're talking about inside Iran and is that Israeli is that US the president answered in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=248.54s)]
*  Informative I think we need to know more about that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=256.74s)]
*  He did not respond to my question and I understand why it was a lengthy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=260.02s)]
*  Exchange about Zelensky typically when he has a meeting with another foreign leader [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=264.74s)]
*  There's some public component some chance for a photo opportunity that kind of thing [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=268.74s)]
*  He did not do that today [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is notable since we are at NATO and NATO supports Ukraine and the president certainly expressed his frustrations about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=274.22s)]
*  Vladimir Putin when it comes to not resolving the war and so I was wondering if the absence of that photo [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=282.1s)]
*  Might have been tactical in his efforts to bring about some kind of ceasefire [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  So it is typical for the president to attack reporting and so forth [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  We understand that we have a job to do to try to discern the best [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=298.64s)]
*  Information we can and to try to get a sense of how the president is making decisions [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  I asked him about his message to the intelligence community and does he want unvarnished? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  Intelligence to come to him to help him to make decisions going forward when often it is a conflicting picture [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=314.24s)]
*  It's not easy to discern in complex [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=320.08s)]
*  situations what [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=324.24s)]
*  The outcome of this particular strike is but much more broadly than that and so I was trying to get at that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=325.76s)]
*  We certainly appreciate that the president takes questions. That is something that he has done a lot on this trip [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes it's contentious [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=337.92s)]
*  You might have seen I had a bit of a death grip on the microphone because I wanted the chance to follow up [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=339.48s)]
*  With the president where we could and then ultimately he moved on to others, but he is also talking about Spain [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  So Spain had a certainly a notable moment here with some of their reservations about contributing that 5% [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  To NATO and we certainly heard from general a secretary general Ruta earlier [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=358.0s)]
*  His heaping praise on President Trump for the military strike and for his longtime [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=363.82s)]
*  Advocacy for an increase in defense spending. So those are some of my initial takeaways [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  from this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=376.14s)]
*  Consequential set of meetings and certainly recent days of events with President Trump [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=377.62s)]
*  I we certainly appreciate your tenacity and asking those questions on behalf of all of us and behalf the American people [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=382.29999999999995s)]
*  To provide that information for us and thanks for also getting up for us real quickly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=389.26s)]
*  To be accessible Kelly for this interview Joel your reaction to what we heard from the president in the past 45 50 minutes now [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=394.26s)]
*  You know, I know there was a lot of multilateralism in this discussion especially related to NATO [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=402.94s)]
*  But I was very concerned about is the lack of urgency by the president to getting a diplomatic path forward with Iran [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=407.61999999999995s)]
*  You know after we the United States dropped the bombs on Japan World War two, there was an armistice [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=415.18s)]
*  We locked it in locked in the end of that war and then had a day forward [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=420.58s)]
*  I really hope that we leverage this moment and take advantage of the window now available [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=424.46s)]
*  To lock in an agreement with Iran and to then move forward to try to figure out how to ensure they never do [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=430.06s)]
*  Achieve a bomb down the road and that we have a new relationship and forge more a peaceful pass in the Middle East [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=435.62s)]
*  Helene how much do you think the Iran situation has impacted how president Trump's been received at this summit? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=442.98s)]
*  We certainly can't forget his checkered history the push caught on camera at the summit in 2017 his past comments about Russia doing whatever the hell [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=449.26s)]
*  They want to NATO countries that don't meet the defense spending goals [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=456.46s)]
*  Etc. And there's that video from 2017, but he seemed to come in here with more of a command of this group [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think he certainly came in with more of a swagger because he's still very proud of what he did over the weekend [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=466.42s)]
*  There is an element of the NATO group as you saw with the German Chancellor Christopher Mers who said [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=475.42s)]
*  I think when Israel first began its campaign against Iran that Israel was doing [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=483.42s)]
*  Everybody's dirty work for them. So there are several countries in within NATO that do not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=489.98s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of relief among some of these countries that the Iranian nuclear program has been set back [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=498.98s)]
*  You can argue about how many months or how many years it's been set back [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=506.98s)]
*  But certainly that this there the strikes that Israel has mounted and what the United States did last Saturday has set a new record [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=510.98s)]
*  The nuclear program back. So President Trump certainly seemed to be relishing that and getting some enjoyment [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=519.9799999999999s)]
*  You know the last international summit he had he attended in Canada the g7 one [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=526.9799999999999s)]
*  He left a day early. This one was he kept his his presence there deliberately short [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=532.54s)]
*  He only arrived yesterday and he's coming back today, but he seems to be enjoying himself [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  Helene, thank you so much for being with us. Raph still major question marks about how much the US strikes may have degraded Iran's nuclear program [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=543.34s)]
*  What's Israel saying as we hear Trump mentioned, you know, trying to have people on site to assess it [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=551.34s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, you heard the president throughout that lengthy press conference railing against this assessment [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=557.34s)]
*  That's put together by the DIA the Pentagon's in-house intelligence agency [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=562.34s)]
*  Which assess that Iran's nuclear program may have been set back three to six months [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=567.34s)]
*  That is not an assessment that the president liked instead [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=571.34s)]
*  He turned to an assessment made by the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  Which is much more favorable to a much more in line with what he's saying [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=580.7s)]
*  This is a three-sentence statement. It says that the Iranian facility at Fordo [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=584.86s)]
*  It's kind of the crown jewel of the Iranian nuclear program rendered inoperable by this American strike [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=590.98s)]
*  It assesses Iran's nuclear program has been set back by many years compared to three to six months [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=597.3s)]
*  Which is the US intelligence assessment and it says this achievement can continue indefinitely [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=603.26s)]
*  If Iran does not get access to nuclear material now, and I was based in Israel for a couple of years [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=608.4599999999999s)]
*  The Atomic Energy Commission is a relatively obscure part of the Israeli government [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=614.3s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not credible, but this is a three-sentence statement [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HOc4DcuGa0&t=619.38s)]
