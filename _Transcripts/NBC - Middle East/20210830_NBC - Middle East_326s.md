# ‘U.S. Has Been Humbled Today’ As Last Troops Leave Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0)
*  Richard Engel, who joins us from Doha. Richard Engel, your thoughts to what you just heard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=0.0s)]
*  from General McKenzie announcing the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=5.12s)]
*  Well, these are heavy days. I don't know any other way to describe it. I do not envy him for having [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=12.64s)]
*  had to make that statement, to speak to the American people, but also to speak to others [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=21.04s)]
*  who served in Afghanistan, including his own family members, and to tell them that we came, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=27.04s)]
*  we fought, and we're leaving, and we're handing over the country back to the same enemy, and that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=32.56s)]
*  we coordinated with the enemy so that they could make sure we packed up and left on time. It is a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=38.16s)]
*  moment of deep humility. The United States has been humbled today. It is another empire that has [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=45.76s)]
*  not fallen in Afghanistan, but that has stumbled in Afghanistan. The British Empire fought in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=53.04s)]
*  Afghanistan and pulled out in defeat, as did the Soviet Union, and now the United States as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=60.56s)]
*  And to what you were just talking about earlier, there's a lot of talk about Afghanistan being the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=66.16s)]
*  longest war in U.S. history. It is the longest combat mission, but for the last several years, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=71.12s)]
*  it wasn't a combat mission. It was a stabilizing mission. There hadn't been any troops in Afghanistan [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=78.16s)]
*  killed in about two years, and the costs had been reduced significantly. There were about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=82.64s)]
*  3,500 troops there that were holding it together who weren't dying, and with their withdrawal, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=89.92s)]
*  you saw quickly the collapse of the entire country. There's going to be a lot of debate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=98.24s)]
*  whether that was the right decision. Most Afghans do not think it was the right decision. Most [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=103.44s)]
*  Afghans never saw those American troops, did not feel occupied by those American troops, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=108.64s)]
*  felt comforted by their presence, and their withdrawal emboldened the Taliban, as did the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=114.48s)]
*  deal signed by President Trump. If you go back, and I'm not trying to get into the blame game in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=120.08s)]
*  politics, there are many in Washington who can do that, but I was in Doha. I'm in Doha now. When [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=126.32s)]
*  that deal was signed, when the deal was signed by President Trump, the Afghan government, which was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=131.12s)]
*  already weak, was not even invited. President Trump made a deal directly with the Taliban, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=136.32s)]
*  and the deal was effectively, the country is yours. That undercut the Afghan government [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=141.44s)]
*  tremendously, tremendously. Then there was troop presence. The troops were, the government continued [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=146.64s)]
*  to sustain. There was low, a reduced level of violence, and then the government was undercut [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=155.28s)]
*  again profoundly when the Biden administration rapidly withdrew troops with very little [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=161.68s)]
*  coordination with the armed forces of Afghanistan and with the government itself. It was given a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  first blow by Trump, and then a death blow by the Biden administration, and they collapsed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=176.32s)]
*  The Taliban moved in, and they're going to be there for a while. They have tremendous amount [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=184.08s)]
*  of weapons. They have tremendous confidence, and who is going to go in now? What power is going to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=188.96s)]
*  go in and undo them? A whole generation of Afghans have been brought up under the umbrella of an [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=196.08s)]
*  American presence there. The life expectancy in Afghanistan went up dramatically. Girls [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  rushed back to school. Music academies opened and thrived. Afghanistan changed profoundly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=209.84s)]
*  It was not always just a war zone. For the last several years, there was a degree of stability. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=216.08s)]
*  There was a degree of hope. Afghans were shocked that the U.S. pulled away the security blanket [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=222.0s)]
*  because it was when it was not the same kind of combat mission that had been there before. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  The decision had been taken. The troops are now gone. That is now history. The question is, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=234.24s)]
*  what will it be for the future? The future for Afghanistan will be, will depend on the good graces [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=239.52s)]
*  of the Taliban. Will they keep their word? Are they really changed? Have they learned from their [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=245.2s)]
*  experiences and now want to engage with the rest of the world? There are many forces, including here [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  in Doha, that want to bring them in that direction, are trying to coax them. Sort of a Pygmalion story. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  But they are also reinforced by their own experience. The Taliban can look back at their [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  own experience and say, our hearts were right. If they were not right, why, this is a religious [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=267.36s)]
*  movement, why would God have rewarded them and given them this victory? So it will be a challenge [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=274.08s)]
*  to bring the Taliban into the international community. But that is the challenge that is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  facing us for the sake of the Afghan people and for the sake of the region, really, because [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=285.52s)]
*  the collapse of a state and the takeover of the state, it's not just a tragedy for the Afghans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=290.4s)]
*  It will suck in other countries around it. The same way when you have a hole in the center of a map, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  it brings other countries and destabilizes other countries and sucks them into that political vortex. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSr-xk80_h0&t=300.64s)]
