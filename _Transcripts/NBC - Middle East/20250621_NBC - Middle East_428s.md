# ‘Childish behavior’: Fmr. Rep. blasts Trump’s ‘ego’ over handling of Israel-Iran conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk)
*  Let's go now to Denver Wigelman. He is joining me and former, of course, Air Force intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=0.0s)]
*  officer, former congressman, former senior adviser to the January 6th select committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=5.68s)]
*  There's a lot going on with you, my friend. So here's the first question to you. Number [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=10.88s)]
*  one, President Trump, he has given himself, what, two weeks now to decide whether he's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=14.68s)]
*  going to deploy U.S. troops to drop a 30,000-pound bomb on Iran. But he appears to have sidelined [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=20.52s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth. Whose intel is he relying on to make his decision? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  Well, my guess is, you know, I was just reading something. I hope it's not John Radcliffe, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=32.24s)]
*  right? And, you know, I also hope, right, that he's not relying on Steve Bannon, the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=37.64s)]
*  MAGA movement, and Putin, right, who warned him not to do it. But I think most of that's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=42.72s)]
*  coming probably from a combination of people ignoring Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=46.68s)]
*  going straight to John Radcliffe, maybe to the Joint Chiefs. My guess is he's probably [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=52.0s)]
*  looking at that. And the issue that you have, if you're not listening to your institutional [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=57.04s)]
*  heads, I wonder about the incompetence that you have at the top. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=61.0s)]
*  And I've warned about that for a long time. If you have people that base policy on fantasy, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=64.2s)]
*  you're going to have a tough time making decisions in the reality of the moment. And I think [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=68.52s)]
*  that's what you're seeing right now with the Trump administration is mass confusion, but [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=72.28s)]
*  also him trying to appease sort of the MAGA base at the same time while trying to make [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  serious decisions on what's going on with Iran and Israel, but also how that actually [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=80.56s)]
*  cascades to Russia and Ukraine, which we can, you know, talk about, Alex. All this is in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=84.8s)]
*  play. But I think what I get out of this is that you have an incompetent head of the intelligence [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=88.88s)]
*  communities and he's listening to other people that sort of go down his line on what his [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=94.28s)]
*  opinion is based on where he is on Israel and also on Russia and also on Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=98.08s)]
*  Let me just get into something. I was just given this, and this is what we're able to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=104.32s)]
*  report this moment on the U.S. Iran engagement. The U.S. and Iran continue this weekend, Denver, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=108.24s)]
*  to communicate, though it's unclear the extent to which these could be considered negotiations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  We have Iran's foreign minister who exclusively told Andrea Mitchell yesterday that they are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=119.28s)]
*  not negotiations. Likewise, a U.S. official this afternoon affirmed that engagement with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=124.24s)]
*  the Iranians is still ongoing today, but the administration is not providing any further [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=129.68s)]
*  detail about the communications or anything about its approach toward Iran in the coming [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=134.24s)]
*  days. I'm curious to your reaction, just a big picture, to what you think is happening [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=138.96s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=144.88s)]
*  Oh, I know what's happening. There's complete confusion on what they're going to do next, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=145.88s)]
*  right? He's getting a lot of pressure from Israel to come in right now, right? Israel [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=150.08s)]
*  started this conflict, and here's the thing, Alex. There's two things that I like about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  this as far as when you're talking about irony and insanity. Number one, when it came out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  that they bombed Iran, we had nothing to do with it. Then we come out later saying, oh, yeah, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=163.2s)]
*  we were part of it. So here's the issue. Are we saying that Israel is dragging us into a war that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  they didn't ask us about or get intelligence on when they started bombing Iran? Are we saying [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=172.56s)]
*  that we lied as a U.S. government initially because we didn't want the truth to come out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=176.32s)]
*  about our intelligence support? Both of those are equally awful. And I think when you're seeing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=180.56s)]
*  the confusion right now, you have an administration that not only knows what's happening internally, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  as we just talked about with Tulsi Gabbard and Heg Seth and who to listen to, but are they [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=189.04s)]
*  briefing Congress? So here's another big issue with the confusion at the executive level. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=192.72s)]
*  What does Congress know? Shouldn't Congress be heavily involved in any execution of funds [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=198.08s)]
*  or any deployment of troops or weapons or ordinance into Iran? So I think it's a massive [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=204.24s)]
*  confusion. There's been insanity in the first four to five months of this administration anyway. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=208.88s)]
*  I don't think we can expect any different as we're trying to maneuver competently through foreign [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=213.04s)]
*  issues like we're seeing today. So again, trying to get to where the truth of everything is, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=218.24s)]
*  Denver, I'm curious what the chances are that U.S. intelligence agency reports on Iran [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=224.08s)]
*  are inaccurate or flat out wrong. As the president told my colleague, NBC's Vaughn Hilliard yesterday. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, Iran's not easy to penetrate, right? And you're going to have courses of action. So as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=236.56s)]
*  an intelligence officer, you know, and I'm very familiar with Iran and I want people to know my [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  history with Iran is extensive, especially in the counter IED space in the mid-2000s when Iran was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=245.04s)]
*  doing resupply to Iraq for IEDs, killed a lot of American GIs. So it's definitely personal for me [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  too when I'm talking about these issues. But I think what we have to look at, right, is we're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=256.64s)]
*  going down the line with Iran, right, as what does instability look like in the region? What [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=262.64s)]
*  does the refugee status look like? I can go through the pros and cons of Iran all day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=270.24s)]
*  I just believe right now we don't have administration that can make a decision [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=274.56s)]
*  based on the best interests of the U.S. because they're too busy trying to appease foreign powers [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=277.92s)]
*  or political interests, regardless of what happens to us long term. And Alex, I think that's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=284.08s)]
*  what worries me. And, you know, I know if we had another hour, I could go through the pros and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=288.8s)]
*  cons of Iran. If you want me to try to do it in five minutes of taking them out and how it deals [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=292.72s)]
*  with Russia, I can. But I think the worry for Americans and for Congress is that we have an [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=296.48s)]
*  administration that seems completely confused about what Iran even is, what their military can [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=301.44s)]
*  do, or what would happen with a destabilization if we were to go into Iran. And listen, there are [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=306.48s)]
*  pros to hitting Iran. I want to tell people right now there are, especially with destabilizing or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=311.12s)]
*  stopping Russia's advance into Ukraine and the drone technology that's going to Russia, the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=315.76s)]
*  Shaheds that are going to Ukraine. There's all kinds of things we can talk about, Alex. But my God, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=320.64s)]
*  can we please get some clarity on what the administration wants to do and whether we're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=324.56s)]
*  just following Israel's lead or we're following the lead of the American citizens and what's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=328.24s)]
*  best for our country. So I want to augment something that you previously said and you're [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=332.08s)]
*  backed up here by the New York Times, which says Trump changed his mind about disclosing U.S. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=336.32s)]
*  involvement only after the Israeli strikes in Iran appeared to be successful. They say, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=341.12s)]
*  when Trump woke up to his favorite TV channel broadcasting imagery of what it was portraying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=346.16s)]
*  as Israel's military genius, Trump could not resist claiming credit for himself. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  What do you find most troubling about that, Denver? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=357.68s)]
*  I find it troubling that somebody whose own ego or to follow the whims of what he thinks is a win [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=360.16s)]
*  is more important than solid foreign policy decisions. It also is this childish behavior. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=370.48s)]
*  And I don't think you want childish behavior where somebody who goes by newspaper or TV [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=377.36s)]
*  reports making decisions for the American public. And I think that's incredibly dangerous. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=382.16s)]
*  And I've said from the beginning, when you elect clowns or you have clowns in positions [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=387.6s)]
*  of leadership or people that are there just for loyalty, that means you don't have serious [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  decision makers and unseriousness equals danger. And I think what you're looking at is an [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=396.88000000000005s)]
*  unserious way of doing business. And that's what should bother every intelligence and, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  I would say, political professional. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LWLIIEBgk&t=406.16s)]
