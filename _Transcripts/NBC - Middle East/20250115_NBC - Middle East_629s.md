# 'Elements of this deal were what I laid out': Biden takes credit for ceasefire—and so does Trump?
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8)
*  But we begin tonight with big news out of the Middle East. Hamas and Israel have finalized [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=0.0s)]
*  a ceasefire deal that will release the remaining hostages and ensure the departure of Israeli [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=6.28s)]
*  forces from Gaza. The news was greeted with jubilation and tears from Tel Aviv to Khan [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=11.82s)]
*  Yunis because it's the first time there is real hope in the region. The announcement [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=17.62s)]
*  comes just days before the transfer of power from President Biden to Donald Trump. Now, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=22.8s)]
*  this feels like historical deja vu. It's probably because a similar situation happened in 1981 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=28.4s)]
*  when American hostages being held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran were freed just as Ronald [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  Reagan took over from Jimmy Carter. Good evening on the 444th and final day of the hostage [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=42.4s)]
*  crisis, which is also the first day of the new Reagan presidency. Here is how NBC's correspondent [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=50.64s)]
*  explained that deal. On the plane coming over, the Carter Party told reporters that Iran [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=57.5s)]
*  will wind up with only $3 billion after withholdings for claims and repayments of loans, that Carter [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=63.74s)]
*  was close to agreement three times and almost had one just before the election, that the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=71.02s)]
*  final deal was sealed at nine o'clock yesterday morning Washington time, but the takeoff was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=76.58s)]
*  probably held off just to embarrass Carter one more time. A prominent Democratic politician at [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=82.02s)]
*  the time told the New York Times that he was a witness to Republican efforts to prevent the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=88.34s)]
*  hostages from being freed before election day. President Biden is trying to avoid a repeat of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=93.78s)]
*  what happened to Carter and make clear that this deal was the fruit of his administration's labor. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  More than 15 months of conflict began with Hezbollah's brutal massacre on October the 7th. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=107.14s)]
*  More than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, the Israeli people. More than [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=113.7s)]
*  15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza. Fighting in Gaza will stop and soon the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=120.26s)]
*  hostages will return home to their families. The elements of this deal, for what I laid out in detail, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=128.9s)]
*  this past May, which was embraced by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=136.18s)]
*  the UN Security Council. President Biden and his national security team have been working for over [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=144.18s)]
*  a year to get Israel and Hamas to sign off on a deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has taken [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  12 trips to the region since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. National security advisor Jake [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  Sullivan and CIA Director William Burns have made frequent trips to the region as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=162.5s)]
*  President Biden is correct that this deal appears to be the exact same proposal that he announced [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=167.94s)]
*  last May. What changed? Trump, who will assume office on Monday at noon. Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=172.66s)]
*  Netanyahu has made it no secret that he prefers Trump and wanted to deliver him a win. The [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=179.94s)]
*  Washington Post reported that Israel would gift something to Trump, but it was believed to be a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=186.1s)]
*  deal on Lebanon. According to reports, Netanyahu has been speaking with Trump for months while [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=191.54s)]
*  Trump was campaigning for reelection. Trump previously told Axios that Netanyahu never [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  wanted peace with the Palestinians, but Trump told him to do what he had to do with Hamas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=203.14s)]
*  Additionally, some of the parents of hostages and Israeli soldiers have been livid at Prime Minister [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=210.1s)]
*  Netanyahu, accusing him of being deceitful and of intentionally extending and expanding the war [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=215.78s)]
*  for his own political benefit, given how he was blamed for the security failures that led up to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=222.98s)]
*  the October 7 attack. President Biden acknowledged that these are waning days of his administration, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=228.74s)]
*  but it was in the interest of the world for his administration to work with Trump's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=236.82s)]
*  incoming administration to get the deal done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=241.94s)]
*  Lacking the same sense of courtesy and decency, Trump immediately took credit for the deal, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=272.9s)]
*  yet another example of Trump putting his name on something someone else built. This deal, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=278.1s)]
*  which Netanyahu delayed for as long as humanly possible, has hung over Biden's head for more [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=283.7s)]
*  than a year and was arguably a key factor in Vice President Harris losing the election, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=288.9s)]
*  as parts of the Democratic base peeled off and either stayed home or even voted for Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=294.42s)]
*  as the so-called peace candidate. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=299.14s)]
*  But what's past is past, and this deal is the present. It will include two phases. The first [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=301.86s)]
*  will last six weeks and includes a complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=307.62s)]
*  populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages. The exact number to be [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  released was not specified, but would include women and the elderly. Israel will release [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=318.34s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and Palestinians can return to their neighborhoods in all [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=323.94s)]
*  areas of Gaza for what remains of those neighborhoods. During those six weeks, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=328.98s)]
*  they will continue to work on phase two, which will include discussion of rebuilding Gaza. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  While both Biden and Trump are taking credit for this deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu says the ceasefire agreement with Hamas is not complete and that final details are still [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=344.42s)]
*  being worked out. Netanyahu has not explicitly said whether he accepts the deal. Joining me now is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  Ayman Moiheddin, host of Ayman on MSNBC and former CIA Director John Brennan, MSNBC senior [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=356.98s)]
*  national security and intelligence analyst. Ayman, I do want to start with you because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=364.1s)]
*  that later news that we just got not too long ago was a bit confusing. We saw the leader of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=368.42s)]
*  Qatar come out and give a very lengthy statement. This deal seemed quite complete. You had [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=373.62s)]
*  President Biden come out and give a statement. You saw Secretary of State Blinken and Vice [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=379.38s)]
*  President Harris standing behind him. It all seemed very complete. What is your reporting on [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=384.18s)]
*  Netanyahu seeming to somewhat walk it back? Well, our colleagues at NBC have been reporting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=389.06s)]
*  that for all intents and purposes, the Netanyahu as a person, if you will, as the prime minister, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=396.18s)]
*  has accepted it. But of course, now it has to work through a mechanism internally within both the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=401.3s)]
*  Israeli security cabinet, the smaller cabinet of key decision makers pertaining to security matters, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=406.5s)]
*  and then perhaps to a full fledged cabinet vote within the next couple of days. But look, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=411.78s)]
*  at the end of the day, there are people inside the Israeli cabinet that we know of who do not [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  support this deal, who just within the last 48 hours were boasting about how they had blocked [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=422.17999999999995s)]
*  previous deals. So there is going to be some internal politics within Israel and certainly [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  within the cabinet of trying to posture this deal as saying, look, we just are focusing on phase one. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  Phase two gives us an out. We can manipulate this. We can kind of deal with this in different phases [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=437.94s)]
*  and in different ways. But for all intents and purposes, when you have the president of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=442.82s)]
*  United States and you have the prime minister of Qatar and the Egyptian government come out and say [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=446.58s)]
*  that a deal has been reached, you can rest assured that they have gotten an assurance from the Israeli [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=451.78s)]
*  prime minister that he is committed to this deal. Otherwise, they would not have done it. Look, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=457.94s)]
*  I've been in touch with many of these leaders over the last 15 months, and I can assure you, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=461.46s)]
*  there were times when people were reporting a deal is imminent, a deal is imminent, and these [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=465.38s)]
*  negotiators were saying to me, no, they do not have the official yes from the key parties. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=470.18s)]
*  And so as a result, it never materialized except today. So you can expect that in the next couple [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=476.34s)]
*  of days and even in the weeks, there will be political posturing inside Israel. Some will [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=481.62s)]
*  spin it in different ways. We've already seen some saying this is a bad deal. It should not be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=485.7s)]
*  accepted. But you can rest assured that as of this evening, there is at least a commitment from the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=489.62s)]
*  Israelis to the Americans, to the Egyptians and to the Qataris that they want to begin this phase [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=494.9s)]
*  of the deal. John Brennan, let me bring you in here because the reality is, is we've gotten to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=500.26s)]
*  know the names of some Israeli officials, Itamar Ben-Gavir, Mr. Smotrich, who are far right members [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=505.85999999999996s)]
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. They keep him in power by being part of his coalition. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=512.02s)]
*  They've been very much opposed to the deal. And as Eamon has said, bragging openly that they [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=516.5799999999999s)]
*  blocked this exact same deal, which has been on the table multiple times, given that this is the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=520.66s)]
*  exact same deal, nothing else has changed. Am I wrong to sort of make the Carter illusion that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=526.02s)]
*  this was delayed and delayed and delayed in part to have the same deal come closer to Trump's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=532.5s)]
*  taking power so that Trump could take credit for it? Does that ring true to you? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=539.86s)]
*  John Brennan, President and CEO, The United States of America [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=544.1s)]
*  I think that may be part of it, Joy. But I also think that Benjamin Netanyahu could have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=545.22s)]
*  struck this deal eight months ago when it was first offered by the Americans. But I think he [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=549.3s)]
*  wanted to further destroy Hamas and in the process further destroy Gaza. And if you look at what [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  happened over the last eight months, the thousands of people have been killed in just the destruction, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=559.4599999999999s)]
*  turning Gaza really into just a pile of rubble. This is something that I think Netanyahu wanted [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=563.54s)]
*  to do. So yes, he does have his right wing cabinet members that he has to take into account. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=568.5s)]
*  But I do think he holds sway within that cabinet, and he could have forged this deal [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=574.5s)]
*  earlier. But again, I think he had an agenda, not just in Gaza, but I think at that time also, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=578.9s)]
*  he was anticipating that Lebanon and Hezbollah was going to also be in his target list. And so [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=583.86s)]
*  therefore, that's why he waited. But he gets a benefit now. With Trump coming in, he can offer [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=590.42s)]
*  a gift to the incoming administration, but also as a way to, I think, recognize the tremendous [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=594.66s)]
*  efforts that the Biden administration made over the past year plus. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwRRNhuqn8&t=600.58s)]
