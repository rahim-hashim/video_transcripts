# Thousands Trying To Flee Afghanistan As Taliban Cements Control Of Country
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 03, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM)
*  Joining me now is Eileen O'Connor, senior vice president for communications policy and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=0.0s)]
*  advocacy at the Rockefeller Foundation, and Ambassador Mike McFaul, former U.S. ambassador [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=3.92s)]
*  to Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=8.56s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=9.56s)]
*  Very good to see you, Eileen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=10.56s)]
*  It's great to see you again. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=11.56s)]
*  I think the last time I saw you may have been in Kabul when you were in the State Department. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=12.56s)]
*  I think it was. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=16.76s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=17.76s)]
*  And your organization has been closely involved, of course, with rescue efforts by private [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=18.76s)]
*  charters, getting people at risk out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=22.32s)]
*  So what options does Rockefeller now have with the U.S. military withdrawn? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=25.12s)]
*  Well, the Rockefeller Foundation has supported some contractors and NGOs in their efforts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=30.12s)]
*  We've given financial support to getting people out, and that was airlifts in the beginning [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=35.88s)]
*  as well to other third countries to help them get to those third countries where they can [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=41.0s)]
*  be processed for visas to the United States or as refugees to other countries. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=46.96s)]
*  So now what's needed really, Andrea, is that we really need the United States diplomatically [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=52.34s)]
*  to work towards establishing some humanitarian corridors, perhaps to Central Asia, which [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=58.16s)]
*  I'm sure Ambassador McFaul could speak to, or also to Pakistan, where they then could [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=64.36s)]
*  either remain or be processed perhaps to another country, to the United States, as they qualify [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=69.16s)]
*  under the special immigrant visa, as well as the P2, where they worked for a U.S. government-funded [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=75.6s)]
*  organization. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  But I would also say, Andrea, that I really would commend all of the Americans that came [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=84.28s)]
*  together in this rescue operation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=88.96s)]
*  It was journalists, former veterans, there were State Department officials currently, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Foreign Service officers who worked with me in Afghanistan from all over the world, were [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=98.32s)]
*  volunteering to be on a task force, as well as the military, both in CENTCOM and on the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=102.96s)]
*  ground, the embassy on the ground, both in Kabul and in these receiving countries, literally [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=108.24s)]
*  were working around the clock, talking to people at one, two, three, four, five o'clock [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=113.44s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=119.24s)]
*  And I think that just shows how really committed people were to our Afghan allies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=120.24s)]
*  And regrettably, we had this severe loss of life of our military members, and my heart [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=127.12s)]
*  does go out to their families as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=132.64s)]
*  Well, I just want to say, from personal experience, part of the International Women's Media Foundation, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=135.32s)]
*  I know you're familiar with their efforts, we were working nonstop. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=142.64s)]
*  Staff was incredibly active on this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=147.32s)]
*  And we, you know, members, board members, were all working on this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  And there were complaints from some groups, for instance, that Voice of America people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=154.76s)]
*  were left behind and that Afghan at-risk journalists were left behind because they didn't qualify [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=158.68s)]
*  for the so-called P2 or P1, certainly not SIV categories, they're not military, they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=163.4s)]
*  didn't work for American companies, but they were part of the Afghan journalists, more [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  than 100, at least 100 left behind. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=173.76s)]
*  We told them to get trained, the State Department helped them with grants, and they didn't qualify [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=178.0s)]
*  for anything. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=183.32s)]
*  And then time ran out after that suicide bombing because they closed the gates to Afghans. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=184.32s)]
*  Well, and that's why we have to advocate for this humanitarian corridor to other countries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=188.76s)]
*  They can be then qualified as refugees under UNHCR. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=193.96s)]
*  And so that would be at least enable them to avoid any kind of retribution from the Taliban. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=198.68s)]
*  But it's also the job of the United States and the international community to withhold [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=207.56s)]
*  the aid and assistance and the money that is currently embargoed from the Taliban until [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=212.28s)]
*  they do live up to their promises for supporting, that they would support and uphold the rights [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=218.12s)]
*  of women and minorities, that there would be no retribution. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=223.36s)]
*  And that's really important right now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=227.52s)]
*  And we really do have to hold their feet to the fire, as well as some of their allies [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=229.52s)]
*  in Pakistan and other places, to try to influence them to make sure that they do not have any [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  retribution against these people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  And I do, you know, I know how involved you were and how many, many people were. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think it just shows how people can come across, can join together across the political [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=247.0s)]
*  spectrum when it's something like this and lives are at stake. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=252.56s)]
*  And I just want to give a shout out to you, to Milan Verveer, to Vital Voices, all these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=256.64s)]
*  organizations. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=260.52s)]
*  Ambassador McCall, one of the big problems is Russia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=261.72s)]
*  You know Russia so well, but we've had a lot of trouble with Russia telling the U.S. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  You can't have basing rights in the stands. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=270.64s)]
*  And I don't know whether we can get any kind of help on refugee relief from those overland [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=273.68s)]
*  routes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=279.08s)]
*  Well, we'll have to wait and see. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  First of all, I also know many American-funded NGOs in Afghanistan and many hundreds, probably [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  thousands of people are still there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=290.56s)]
*  And I applaud the work that Rockefeller and others have done. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  It's been fantastic. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=295.68s)]
*  But I want to remind everybody the mission is not over. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=296.88s)]
*  As Eileen said, those people are still there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=300.64s)]
*  We have to find new modalities to get them out. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  And the government, our government, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, excuse me, Secretary [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=306.08s)]
*  Clinton was my former boss, have said we're going to do that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=312.32s)]
*  I think it's very important for us to keep focused on this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  So thank you for talking about it right now, Andrea. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=318.84s)]
*  Those people are still there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=321.88s)]
*  I hear from them every day and they want to get out. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=322.96s)]
*  Now, with respect to Russia and even China, I would add to your list, in the short term, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  This is a giant victory for their ideological struggle against us, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=331.5s)]
*  They're saying we have lost and they're right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=337.02s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=339.1s)]
*  We defeated the Taliban and now they're back. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=340.14s)]
*  That is a defeat for the United States and our ideas of democracy and liberty. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=343.9s)]
*  This is a backlash to that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=348.94s)]
*  But in the medium term and the long term, I'm not so sure this is a great victory for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=353.18s)]
*  Russia or China. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=356.86s)]
*  Remember, they have large Muslim communities of their own. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=358.62s)]
*  They have jihadist movements of their own, including in Central Asia, as you just mentioned, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=361.9s)]
*  right next to Afghanistan, that will create a security challenge for them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=366.86s)]
*  And then in the long run, I just keep wanting to remind people, I've heard so many declarations [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=370.86s)]
*  of the end of democracy and Western liberalism this week. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=375.14s)]
*  And I just want to remind everybody, that's exactly what people said in 1975. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=379.58s)]
*  Remember 1975, what was going on? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't just one country, Vietnam. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=386.3s)]
*  It was all of Indochina that had fallen to the communists. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=388.3s)]
*  They were on the march in Southern Africa and Latin America. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=391.82s)]
*  We had big problems here at home in terms of human rights and a corrupt president. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=395.5s)]
*  And 15 years later, we were back. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=403.14s)]
*  And I don't want to predict the future. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=406.26s)]
*  I don't know the future. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=407.54s)]
*  But to say that today is the end of democracy and liberalism in the world, I think that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=408.62s)]
*  is premature. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfD7w-pripM&t=413.78000000000003s)]
