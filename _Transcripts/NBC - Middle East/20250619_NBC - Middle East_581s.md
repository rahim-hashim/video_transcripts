# ‘Flinching from the consequences of responsibility’: Trump says he needs two weeks to decide on Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE)
*  Question of the hour. Will the United States get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=0.0s)]
*  At the White House today, Team Trump said, in effect, stand by for the next two weeks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=6.4s)]
*  Here's the press secretary. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=11.6s)]
*  Now, regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=14.64s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision-making and whether or not [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=19.6s)]
*  the United States will be directly involved. In light of that news, I have a message directly [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=23.92s)]
*  from the president, and I quote, based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=28.88s)]
*  that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=35.2s)]
*  not to go within the next two weeks. That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=40.48s)]
*  Brand new reporting suggests that the Trump administration is on the precipice of an armed [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=47.28s)]
*  intervention. Three people familiar with deliberations tell the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=51.76s)]
*  that Donald Trump, quote, told senior aides late Tuesday that he approved of attack plans for Iran [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=56.0s)]
*  but was holding off on giving the final order to see if Tehran would abandon its nuclear program. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=62.0s)]
*  Trump is hoping that threatening to join Israel's strikes on Iran will compel Tehran [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=67.36s)]
*  to meet his demands. In public, at least, the Iranian regime remains defiant, saying that they [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=71.68s)]
*  will not negotiate and will retaliate if the U.S. launches airstrikes. The Pentagon already playing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=77.2s)]
*  out what could happen next. The New York Times reporting, officials are considering all of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=83.92s)]
*  ways Iran could retaliate. One possibility, according to officials, quote, Iran retains the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=88.48s)]
*  naval assets and other capabilities it would need to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a move that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=94.0s)]
*  could pin any U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf, American military officials say. In meetings at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=99.28s)]
*  the White House, senior military officials have raised the need to prepare for that possibility [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=105.44s)]
*  after Iranian officials threatened to mine the strait if the United States joined Israel attacks [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=110.96s)]
*  on the country. And that could have severe economic consequences too. The Times reporting, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=116.0s)]
*  a quarter of the world's oil passes through it, so mining the choke point would cause gas prices to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  soar. Meanwhile, Israel and Iran continue to trade strikes. A major hospital in southern Israel took [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  a direct hit from an Iranian missile. At least 40 people were injured. Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=133.84s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu calling it the work of a, quote, criminal regime. That is where we start [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=138.8s)]
*  today with New York Times Pentagon correspondent and MSNBC contributor Helene Cooper. And joining [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=144.72s)]
*  me, David Frum, staff writer for The Atlantic and host of the video podcast, The David Frum Show, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  and former U.S. Senator, MSNBC political analyst Claire McCaskill. All right, Helene, let's start [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  with you. What does your reporting tell you about what Donald Trump is considering? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=159.84s)]
*  Well, he's looking high. And thanks for having me. President Trump is, as we've all been reporting, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=164.56s)]
*  looking at the possibility of dropping a bunker buster, which is sort of the name we use for one [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=173.44s)]
*  of those big, really big bombs that only the United States has on the Fordo nuclear plant that is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=182.48s)]
*  buried at more than 250 feet in a mountain in Iran. That is one of the things that Israel [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=191.2s)]
*  can't do itself. I'd like to say we're in untrodden territory, but we're not. We kind of have been [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=198.32s)]
*  in this place before. And we were here in 2003 when we went into the Iraq War. There seems to be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  a lot of officials in the Trump administration who seem to appear to think that this is a one drop, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=214.8s)]
*  one and done type deal. We go in and you drop this bomb and that's it. The Iranian regime is, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=221.68s)]
*  the nuclear regime is done for. President Trump appeared to allude to that in his stream of tweets [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=230.0s)]
*  this week as well. The Pentagon is more cautious because they believe that the Pentagon officials [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=235.6s)]
*  believe that Iran can retaliate. With all of this bombing campaign that Israel has embarked upon, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=241.84s)]
*  they have left Iran's naval assets so far alone. Iran retains the ability to mine the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=248.4s)]
*  Strait of Hormuz. Iran still has enough ballistic missiles at this point to attack American bases [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=256.4s)]
*  in the Mideast and attack American troops at those bases. So the Pentagon is preparing for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=263.2s)]
*  the possibility that this could be a far more protracted military engagement back in the same [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=268.96s)]
*  region that we just left after 20 years than President Trump seems to be alluding to. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=275.84s)]
*  Helene, you laid out a series of differentials for us. There's also a differential in how different [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=284.08s)]
*  members of this administration are assessing the threat. There's reporting that CIA Director John [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=289.44s)]
*  Radcliffe has been arguing that Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon. This is from [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  The Washington Post. Radcliffe used a football analogy in a closed-door Senate Appropriations [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=298.64s)]
*  subcommittee hearing Tuesday to argue that the formal U.S. intelligence assessment that Iran has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  not decided to build a bomb is of limited use. It's like saying a football team marched 99 yards [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=308.64s)]
*  down the field, got to the one-yard line, and oh, they don't have the intention to score. One of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=315.36s)]
*  the people quoted him as telling lawmakers. Helene, does that square with Tulsi Gabbard saying back [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=320.64s)]
*  in March that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon, which to our understanding [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=326.0s)]
*  is still the current assessment of the intelligence community? No, you're absolutely right. That is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=330.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's assessment is still the assessment of the intelligence community. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=336.88s)]
*  You have that difference of opinion. President Trump has made clear that he is choosing now not [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=343.68s)]
*  to believe Tulsi Gabbard. We'll see how long that lasts. I've been covering this issue since 2006, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=351.12s)]
*  and the number of stories and the number of times I have heard officials say that Iran is one month, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=363.6s)]
*  two months, three months, two years, they're right at breakout, is about, for the length of time, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=370.32s)]
*  I've been covering this issue. I've heard this over and over and over again, and I think it becomes [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=377.52s)]
*  a case of when does the United States or when does Israel decide that they are ready, they're [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  not willing to wait out or to allow negotiations to play out any longer. You will recall that there [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  was a nuclear deal agreement with Iran that President Obama struck, that President Trump [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=398.32s)]
*  turned around and pulled the United States out of. We are where we are, and I think it's going to be [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=406.8s)]
*  a decision that will be made by President Trump. He seems to be saying that nobody knows what he's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=412.48s)]
*  going to do. He's going to decide when he's going to do it. I've given up at this point on predicting [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=417.36s)]
*  what he's going to do. I'm not sure he knows. Smart move from a smart lady. David, when you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=422.32s)]
*  were in a pivotal moment for a presidency, which I think it is fair to call this moment, and a decision [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=427.92s)]
*  of this magnitude arises, what do those conversations normally look like? And then [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=433.76s)]
*  compare that to what we are seeing from this administration. Well, I don't think you should [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=438.4s)]
*  compare this administration to anything else in American history. This collection of jokers and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=443.76s)]
*  crackpots and crooks. We should not allow the drama of the moment to efface from our minds what we know [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=448.88s)]
*  about this administration. It is vacillating. It is weak. When President Trump says he needs two [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=456.0s)]
*  weeks, that means he's looking for a way not to make a decision, not for a way to make a decision. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=461.04s)]
*  That he enjoys the feeling of power in his hands, but he flinches from the consequences [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=466.24s)]
*  of responsibility. He staffed his administration with people who shouldn't be in positions of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  public trust. One obvious move that the Iranians would have, for example, if the United States [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=477.12s)]
*  struck at them, would be to activate terror networks inside the United States and inside [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=480.56s)]
*  America's, what remains of America's networks of allies after Trump's attacks on all the allies. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  So we've got to... Now, if you're going to defend the country against those, you've got an FBI where [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=489.68s)]
*  they've laid off all the counterterrorism professionals, headed by jokers. You've got [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=495.52s)]
*  a Department of Homeland Security that has spent millions and millions of dollars on an advertising [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=500.0s)]
*  campaign to say, thank you, Trump. Again, with kind of a play-acting director. You've got a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=505.28s)]
*  Defense Department who's under the leadership that no one would put this Defense Department [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=512.16s)]
*  under on the way to war. It just doesn't add up. So Trump loves bluster. He loves talk. One of the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=517.2s)]
*  things that the Israelis need to keep in mind, and my friends in the pro-Israel community need [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=522.48s)]
*  to keep in mind, Trump betrays everyone who trusts him with one exception, and that is Vladimir Putin, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=526.24s)]
*  not Israel. He's betrayed his creditors. He's betrayed his investors. He's betrayed his wives. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=532.48s)]
*  He's betrayed his children. He will betray you too. Be wary of putting your trust in him. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=536.96s)]
*  And Israel's not a very exposed position. It's got, it's begun a war with magnificent success, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=542.0s)]
*  but it doesn't have an obvious way to bring the war to a successful conclusion. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=547.92s)]
*  It was counting on Trump to help them. They must have relied on [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  indications. But there's two weeks, two weeks. That's what Trump does when he's about to fold his cards. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6CkgMFlXE&t=555.12s)]
