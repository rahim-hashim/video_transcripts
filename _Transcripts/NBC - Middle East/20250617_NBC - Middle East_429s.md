# 'I don't care what she says': Trump counters DNI assessment on Iran nuclear program
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM)
*  Ned, if I flashback to March when the director of national intelligence said this, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=0.0s)]
*  the IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, then we hear from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=6.28s)]
*  the president today, what do you make of what appears to be conflicting statements at the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=11.64s)]
*  very least in their assessments between the president and the DNI? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=16.32s)]
*  Well, I don't know that we should give the personal assessment of the president of the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=20.68s)]
*  United States much credibility here compared to what the intelligence community has said for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=26.84s)]
*  nearly 20 years now. This is not an assessment that Tulsi Gabbard first put out in March. This [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=32.04s)]
*  is an assessment that the IC has made, the intelligence community has maintained since [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=38.08s)]
*  2007. Judging that in the year 2003, Iran had an active nuclear weapons program, that is to say, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=42.24s)]
*  it was seeking to actually build a nuclear weapon, but ceased those activities in 2003. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=49.64s)]
*  For the president to now say that the intelligence community is wrong, he is contradicting some 20 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=57.08s)]
*  years of intelligence that has gone into that. It just, as you said, was reaffirmed most recently [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=64.08s)]
*  by Tulsi Gabbard in March. So I think the broader question here, Ana, there are really two. What [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=69.96s)]
*  are Israel's plans, intentions, its objectives? And secondly, where does the United States stand [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=77.16s)]
*  this? When Israel started this operation last Thursday, it made it sound like it was going [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=83.12s)]
*  after Iran's nuclear program, trying to defang its military. Now that may be evolving, and we've [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=87.56s)]
*  seen indications, including the news that NBC confirmed that Iran was seeking to go after the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  supreme leader to suggest this might be about something bigger and even regime change in Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Second, and perhaps even more importantly, where does the United States stand in all of this? And [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=103.04s)]
*  Monica said this was contradictory. I think that is even putting it lightly because President Trump [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  has taken almost every single position imaginable on Israel's conduct in this operation. Initially, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=112.24s)]
*  he said, don't do it. Then he called the initial effects excellent. After talking to President [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=119.28s)]
*  Putin, he called for de-escalation. He later told ABC News the United States might get involved. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=124.28s)]
*  Last night, he ordered everyone in Tehran to evacuate. But then later he signed on to a G7 [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=129.32s)]
*  statement that called for de-escalation. So we don't know where the United States stands in this, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=135.44s)]
*  and that's a big problem on us. Yeah, there were a lot of back and forths and whiplash along the way [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=139.96s)]
*  in the past few days. Courtney, the Pentagon we now know is moving more assets to the Middle East. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  President says Iran won't touch U.S. troops. Bring us the latest on U.S. involvement militarily at [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  this point. Yeah, and at the Pentagon, that's really the biggest concern is that somehow the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  U.S. gets pulled into it or we see U.S. military or personnel in the region who are injured or even [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=160.52s)]
*  worse as this back and forth continues between Iran and Israel. Now, the U.S., as you mentioned, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=166.76s)]
*  is moving another carrier strike group into the region. The USS Nimitz was in Asia. I mean, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=172.44s)]
*  it's very important to point out they were supposed to have a port call in Vietnam, which is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  pretty rare and difficult to arrange, and it was canceled at the last minute so that they could [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=182.76s)]
*  move them forward to the Middle East where they ultimately were going to be going anyway. They'd [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=186.76s)]
*  be going in to eventually swap out the USS Carl Vinson. You see it on the screen there, but now, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=190.84s)]
*  instead, there's going to be an overlap of about a month or so of the two of them there in the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=195.24s)]
*  region. Keep in mind that the last several carrier deployments to the region have basically all been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=200.12s)]
*  extended in some cases for months because of ongoing tensions in the region. The Vinson is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  already there. As I said, there are associated ships with it, and the U.S. also has some [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=209.72s)]
*  destroyers, ballistic missile-capable destroyers in the Mediterranean. They're moving more into [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  the region. Anna, what our viewers should take from all of these moves is this provides more [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=218.44s)]
*  U.S. military capability for defensive posture. So if, in fact, Iran is launching off a barrage [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=222.92s)]
*  of missiles or drones or whatever it is towards Israel, the U.S. can help with that defense, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=229.88s)]
*  but they also bring a significant offensive capability if, in fact, the United States does [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  get drawn into this in a more military, some sort of a more military fashion. Beyond that, though, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=240.2s)]
*  aircraft carriers are often used for a show of presence, a show of strength, a show of force, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  and they do have that, ultimately, that capability to provide that. We also have heard about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=252.04s)]
*  additional tankers. Those are aerial refueling aircraft that are moved into the region. Some of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=257.56s)]
*  them are for an exercise, but some of them are also to be there should, in fact, this get to a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=262.28s)]
*  point where the U.S. military gets more directly involved, Anna. Major, what are your thoughts [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=266.68s)]
*  about the possibility of the U.S. getting more involved militarily? I mean, that's definitely [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  nothing that I want to see, and the Secretary of Defense has been very clear on that. It's not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=276.44s)]
*  what they want to see. This is about defending American forces in the region, but also defending [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=279.56s)]
*  our ally Israel. As Iran launches ballistic missiles towards civilian areas, it's not what [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=284.12s)]
*  I want to see. Let's listen to what Richard Engel is hearing as he's speaking with senior officials [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=289.88s)]
*  across the Middle East. This is what they're telling him about the situation. They're telling [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=294.68s)]
*  me that this all feels like 2002 all over again, that there's discussion of redrawing the map of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=299.56s)]
*  the Middle East, changing the mentality of the Middle East, regime change in the Middle East, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=306.36s)]
*  allegations of weapons of mass destruction, imminently being ready and imminently going [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  to be used in a variety of locations. And not here necessarily in Israel, but across the Arab world, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=316.68s)]
*  I'm hearing this on a daily basis. People are worried, are we back in 2002? Are we back in 2003 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=323.72s)]
*  all over again? And then take a look at what Israel's Minister of Defense posted today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=331.32s)]
*  It translates to, quote, I warn the Iranian dictator, those who follow in Saddam Hussein's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  footsteps will end up like Saddam Hussein. Major, do you think regime change in Iran is where this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=342.76s)]
*  is all headed? And is that the answer? No, I don't think that's the worst heaven. I don't think, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=350.36s)]
*  you know, people talk about forever wars. This is actually ending a forever war. Iran has been the, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=355.24s)]
*  as the G7 said, the biggest instability in the Middle East for a very long time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=360.76s)]
*  Now, it wasn't just international or United States intelligence that reported on their [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  nuclear progression. The International Atomic Energy, the morning before Israel attacks, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=371.0s)]
*  said that for the first time in 20 years that Iran is in violation of non-nuclear proliferation. It [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=376.76s)]
*  is building a bomb. This is ending that program. And it is important to keep the objectives very [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=382.76s)]
*  limited. So I don't, I haven't heard anybody said the objective is regime change. If that's a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=387.96s)]
*  byproduct that the 90 million Iranians that are under this terror of the regime are free, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  that's a byproduct. But it is important for this war to keep the objectives limited. This is about [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  rolling back that Iranian nuclear weapons program that is and was close to breakout, as they call it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsDe2nqgYM&t=402.44s)]
