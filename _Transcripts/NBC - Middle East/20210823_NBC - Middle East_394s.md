# Johnson: Kabul Airport Situation Is Going To Get A Lot Worse Before It Gets Better
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o)
*  Joining us now, former Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson, who also served as general counsel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=0.0s)]
*  at the Pentagon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=4.76s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=5.76s)]
*  Well, the U.S. got into Afghanistan, you know, 20 years ago to fight terrorism. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=8.08s)]
*  And they say, and President Trump said, we're getting out now because that threat has been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=13.36s)]
*  eliminated. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=17.64s)]
*  But has it really been eliminated? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=18.64s)]
*  Because it's been diminished. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=20.68s)]
*  Al-Qaeda has been diminished, they say, but it's still there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=22.56s)]
*  And now we have this threat from ISIS and other terror groups. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=25.44s)]
*  What is your take? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Andrea, let's start with this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=30.36s)]
*  Afghanistan, and I've been there several times, is most notable because it's remote, it's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=32.68s)]
*  mountainous, and it's mostly ungoverned space. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=38.92s)]
*  You could probably hide an entire large American city in the mountains of Afghanistan undetected. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=43.16s)]
*  It is the very type of place that terrorist groups seek to establish as a headquarters, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=48.92s)]
*  a base for training and gathering, whether it's Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, Yemen, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=57.08s)]
*  Syria, parts of Iraq. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=64.2s)]
*  So there is that real risk, particularly now that the Taliban has taken over again [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=66.28s)]
*  in the government there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=71.96s)]
*  On the other hand, terrorist organizations, some at least, do have the capability to think [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=73.32s)]
*  rationally. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=79.8s)]
*  We're in the process of leaving Afghanistan right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=80.68s)]
*  A terrorist organization doesn't necessarily want to do something to provoke us to stay [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=85.24s)]
*  or double down in our presence. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=90.44s)]
*  But we do have to regard the recent turn of events as creating a real risk of another [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=92.76s)]
*  terrorist organization, whether it's ISIS-K, Al-Qaeda, trying to reestablish a foothold [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=99.88s)]
*  in Afghanistan, Andrea. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=105.16s)]
*  Would it have been better to leave 3,500 troops as the Pentagon had recommended? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  That was overruled, of course, by the president. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=114.04s)]
*  Andrea, I've been saying for months now that I think it would have been appropriate to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  leave a small special force dedicated to counterterrorism intelligence collection purposes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=121.72s)]
*  One thing that is lost in this debate, there's getting out and there's getting out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=130.44s)]
*  At one point 10 years ago, as you know, we had a presence there of over 100,000 troops. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=135.56s)]
*  That force is almost all gone. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=142.28s)]
*  Combat operations have been discontinued. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  I believe it would have been appropriate and prudent for us to leave a very small force. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about a country of 38 million people, a very small force in place that could [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=154.12s)]
*  accomplish a lot for counterterrorism purposes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=158.6s)]
*  We've seen that in places like Syria and Iraq, what a force of just 1,000 or 2,000 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=161.56s)]
*  of our people can do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=167.88s)]
*  They keep talking about over the horizon, counterintelligence and counterterrorism, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=169.56s)]
*  but it would take drones hours to get there from Qatar. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=175.32s)]
*  And so then they've wasted half the mission just going back and forth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=180.44s)]
*  Wouldn't it have been better to keep Bagram and to keep some force on the ground? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=185.4s)]
*  Well, there are several reasons why it would have been better to keep Bagram. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=192.36s)]
*  Bagram is itself, at its peak, it was itself like a large American city. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  You had something like 100,000 troops that could pass through at any one time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=201.72s)]
*  It would have been better certainly for the current operations at the airport in Kabul [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=208.2s)]
*  and for our own purposes to keep some small, very small footprint there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=213.48s)]
*  But we did not. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=219.72s)]
*  True, there is an over the horizon capability. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  But it is not a quick and easy substitute for having an actual presence there, a small [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=224.92s)]
*  presence there on the ground. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  I understand the desire to get out, Andrea, after 20 years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  But getting out doesn't necessarily mean removing every single member of the United States [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=238.2s)]
*  military from that place. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  As you know, we have our military in small forces stationed in a number of places around [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  And we also removed the military contractors by shutting down Bagram, the people who kept [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=253.4s)]
*  the Afghan Defense Air Force going because without that, without the repair and the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=258.36s)]
*  mechanical help and the support, plus the military cover, the air cover, because that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=265.08s)]
*  really contributed to their sense of abandonment and one of the reasons why they flipped sides. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=271.08s)]
*  But I also want to ask you about the debate internally in terms of leaving when we left [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  in May, in the middle of going into the fighting season rather than delaying it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  And if you're going to leave, pull out completely, getting the military out safely first, that's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=288.84s)]
*  the argument for taking Bagram out first before you get the civilians and the diplomats and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=294.76s)]
*  the Afghan allies out. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  That priority, which was debated internally, is really coming into question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=302.44s)]
*  Clearly, had we predicted what we're facing now at Hamid Karzai International Airport, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=309.48s)]
*  with Americans and Afghans surging on the airport, we would have left in place our [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=317.72s)]
*  military. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  We've had to put back in something up to 6,000 to deal with the situation at the domestic [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=324.44s)]
*  airport now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=331.08s)]
*  And so, for whatever reason in the situation room, they concluded that they wanted to move [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=331.88s)]
*  the so-called boots on the ground first. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=339.64s)]
*  Obviously, we've had to rethink that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  And I believe that the situation at the airport is going to get a lot worse before it gets [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  better. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a country of 38 million people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=350.76s)]
*  We've got to deal with the American citizens, those who qualify for special immigrant visas, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=354.44s)]
*  but then those who also qualify for refugee status under our laws. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=360.28s)]
*  And that population could snowball. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=364.44s)]
*  Former Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson, as always, thank you very much for being with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=368.76s)]
*  us today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUo33MpbL7o&t=390.28s)]
