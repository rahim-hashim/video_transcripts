# ‘All Of Them Have Names’: 10 Civilians Killed In Kabul Drone Strike
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs)
*  As we withdrew U.S. forces from Afghanistan last month and started to evacuate American and Afghan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=0.0s)]
*  civilians, there was a terrible attack on the Kabul airport by a branch of ISIS called ISIS-K. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=6.16s)]
*  You'll remember 13 American service members lost their lives in that attack alongside more than 170 [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=12.4s)]
*  Afghans, according to the Washington Post. It was brutal, happened right by the airport amidst this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=18.96s)]
*  crowd. And just days later, the U.S. conducted a drone strike on a man the military believed was a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=23.439999999999998s)]
*  quote ISIS facilitator. Now days after the attack, the nation's top military officer, General Mark [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=30.16s)]
*  Milley, defended the strike amid reports of civilian deaths saying quote, at this point [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=36.32s)]
*  we think the procedures were correctly followed and that this was a righteous strike. Well today, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=41.04s)]
*  the Pentagon admitted it was not an attack on an ISIS facilitator, it was instead an attack on 10 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=46.72s)]
*  Afghan civilians including seven children. These are images of those who were killed in the strike, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=52.8s)]
*  according to the New York Times and the Independent. The adults were Zamari Ahmadi, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=60.4s)]
*  his cousin Nasser, and his 20-year-old son Zameer. Ahmadi's younger sons were also killed, Faisal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=64.96s)]
*  and Farzad, as well as his nephews, Bayamin and Arwin. Three young girls were also killed in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=71.28s)]
*  strike. Little girls, Hayat, Samaya and Malika, all of them have names like our children have names, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=78.4s)]
*  like your children have names, like Ryan, David and Anya have names. The so-called explosives the military [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  claimed they saw on the back of the truck were likely water bottles. And without extensive reporting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  from the New York Times, which did an incredible job of investigating security footage leading up [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=97.04s)]
*  to the strike and showing fairly conclusively that they killed the wrong person, people, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=101.44s)]
*  it is hard to know if we would have heard the Pentagon say today they mistakenly killed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=108.24s)]
*  10 people, 10 innocent people living their lives. Here's the thing, killings by our government and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=112.96s)]
*  our military like this are not new. In fact, they have been frequent. Horrifically so, throughout [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=122.08s)]
*  the two decades of war, the U.S. has waged in Afghanistan. They are a huge part of the reason [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=129.04s)]
*  it was time for the U.S. to leave Afghanistan and why so many civilians were happy to see us go. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=133.67999999999998s)]
*  Craig Whitlock is an investigative reporter for the Washington Post, author of the Afghanistan [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=140.64s)]
*  Papers, A Secret History of the War, and he joins me now. Craig, I can't help but feel a certain [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=144.32s)]
*  frustration with the reaction to this insofar as this has been something very common throughout [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=151.68s)]
*  the war on terror and has been largely occluded from the consciousness of the American public [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=162.0s)]
*  by and large. What was unusual about this case, Chris, is that there was such extensive evidence [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=168.88s)]
*  collected by news media organizations in terms of surveillance video and witness statements [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=176.72s)]
*  that showed very clearly that the targets here were not terrorists, that this was an aid worker [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=182.0s)]
*  and his family, that the Pentagon's account of what happened originally just didn't stand up to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  scrutiny. And that's because this happened in Kabul and there were lots of reporters around, but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=193.2s)]
*  most of the airstrikes and drone strikes in Afghanistan and other places occur in rural [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  areas where there's no journalists there to witness it or they can only come in days later. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=202.64s)]
*  So what's unusual about this case is that there was essentially video of what happened and it was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=207.92s)]
*  pretty well documented that the official version was false. Brown University's Cost of War project [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=212.88s)]
*  said this, in fact, that we had sort of amped up our strikes in 2019-2020. In 2019, airstrikes killed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=220.0s)]
*  700 civilians, more civilians than in any other year since the beginning of the war [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=228.4s)]
*  in 01 and 02. And the number of civilians killed by international airstrikes increased about 330% [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  from 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration to 2019. So there had been an [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=240.0s)]
*  increased pace of this kind of activity in the last few years. Yeah, and this is a time when the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=244.8s)]
*  American public really wasn't paying very much attention to Afghanistan, but under President [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=251.84s)]
*  Trump, the number of airstrikes in the war in Afghanistan intensified to new levels that hadn't [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=257.04s)]
*  been seen previously in the war. So even though we had many fewer troops on the ground in Afghanistan [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  than we did at the height of the surge under President Obama, the air wars reached new record [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=269.44s)]
*  levels of airstrikes and the number of civilian casualties increased every year. This went on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=275.6s)]
*  until the last year or so when the U.S. sort of had a truce of sorts with the Taliban [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  but this is something that's absolutely true. The number of civilian casualties [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=286.88s)]
*  increased year by year and the airstrikes reached new levels. So this sort of thing was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=291.04s)]
*  unfortunately very common in Afghanistan in the last few years. And particularly in outside of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=295.12s)]
*  Kabul, right, in rural areas. This dispatch filed for the Wall Street Journal I thought was very [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=300.88s)]
*  good. It was just about the fact that in these rural districts, there's basically something [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=304.88s)]
*  approaching peace for the first time in two decades. In Afghanistan's rural districts where [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=308.56s)]
*  Taliban rules don't differ that much from existing conservative customs, the calculation [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=312.56s)]
*  is different in terms of support. To villages here, the collapse of the Afghan Republic in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=317.12s)]
*  the U.S. draw me in above all the guns have fallen silent for the first time in two decades. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=320.96s)]
*  That's right Chris and there's something else I want to point out about this strike though. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=327.36s)]
*  The Pentagon said today that the threshold for them to get the green light to fire this missile [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=330.24s)]
*  was only that they needed a reasonable certainty is how they described it. That the target in fact [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=337.12s)]
*  posed an imminent threat. So reasonable certainty that doesn't sound very ironclad. That almost [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=342.8s)]
*  sounds like a little more than 50 percent guess that they think the target is a threat. That's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=348.48s)]
*  something that the Pentagon acknowledged to be that they need to raise that threshold in the future [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=354.4s)]
*  but that's something I think warrants a lot more scrutiny. Here you have not just an attack but it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  was in Kabul in the most populated city in Afghanistan where they knew there were going [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=364.16s)]
*  to be lots of civilians around and you know that's a kind of threshold that I think the military but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  Congress as well needs to take a closer look at because this is a tactic that as you pointed out [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  has been going on for 20 years that's really the heart of our counter-terrorism operations. But [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  going forward you know there's some question is how generally effective this is in terms of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=385.92s)]
*  hurting civilians or actually killing suspected terrorists but you know does it cause more problems [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=391.52s)]
*  than it solves in terms of the backlash among civilians in that area because you know there's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=396.56s)]
*  no question as you point out rural areas of Afghanistan there's people are just so tired [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=402.32s)]
*  of war and tired of the violence and people aren't real keen on the Taliban but they're just they [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=408.08s)]
*  just wanted the fighting to stop. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzBQHswPqXs&t=413.2s)]
