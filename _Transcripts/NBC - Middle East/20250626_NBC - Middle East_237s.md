# Iran ‘can always reconstitute’ nuclear program, it’s a question of ‘how long’ it will take: Farkas
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY)
*  If I can, Evelyn, I want to tell you something that just happened moments ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=0.0s)]
*  This has been a full day, as you well know, of the administration putting forth its position [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=5.28s)]
*  on how things went at Forto and the other nuclear sites. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Just moments ago, White House Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt was asked about the U.S. relationship [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=14.42s)]
*  with Iran, and here's what she said. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=20.48s)]
*  The president wants peace. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=23.94s)]
*  He always has. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  And right now, we're on a diplomatic path with Iran. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  The president and his team, namely Special Envoy Witkoff, continue to be in communication [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=29.08s)]
*  with the Iranians and especially our Gulf and Arab partners in the region to come to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=34.08s)]
*  an agreement with Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=39.04s)]
*  The president has made some comments about a possible meeting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=41.68s)]
*  We don't know any specifics of that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=45.76s)]
*  Often the president will drop things, and we don't really know the details of it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=48.16s)]
*  Do you see an opening at this point for the possibility of the resumption of diplomacy here? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  Yes, Chris, I do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=61.24s)]
*  All the things that you just cited and what the press spokeswoman just said, and certainly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=63.24s)]
*  everything that President Trump has said indicates that he is determined to make sure that the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=68.72s)]
*  war does not break out again between Israel and Iran, and he believes that this is mission [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=74.44s)]
*  accomplished for the U.S. military. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=79.64s)]
*  And frankly, even if we didn't obliterate every piece of the nuclear arsenal, you know, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  or nuclear program, that's not the point, because Iran can always reconstitute their [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  It's really a question of how long it will take, whether they can race and do it before [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  So we have to get negotiations underway as soon as possible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  President Trump needs to keep the pressure on so that they don't drag out, because there [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=104.94s)]
*  is a danger that Iran could use the time to try to reconstitute their program if there's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=109.58s)]
*  enough left over. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=114.66s)]
*  But ultimately, regardless, the only way you're going to get Iran to be less of a threat to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=116.08s)]
*  the international community is to get international inspectors in there on the ground, and that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=121.5s)]
*  can only happen after we have a diplomatic agreement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  There's also the question of the Ayatollah himself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=129.78s)]
*  We just heard his comments. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, he has a domestic audience that he has to speak to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=134.38s)]
*  But he also, the reporting is, is in a bunker with his families. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=139.1s)]
*  He knows what the danger is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=143.06s)]
*  What do we know about his mindset or the decisions that are facing him right now? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=145.66s)]
*  Well, it sounds like he is probably pretty realistic about the amount of time that he [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=150.98s)]
*  has left on this earth, whether it's because of his opponents who may want to eliminate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=157.62s)]
*  him from the political scene, and I'm thinking mostly, of course, of Israel, but also, you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=163.12s)]
*  know, actuarially, he's in his late 80s, I believe. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=167.6s)]
*  So he has to be thinking about succession, and we have seen reports that he has designated [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=171.44s)]
*  successors. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=176.84s)]
*  It is interesting that he talked about the nation, because I think there is an attempt [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=177.84s)]
*  to say, look, this may be an attempt to keep the nuclear program going as well, because [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=183.64s)]
*  the Iranian people thus far, they probably have associated the nuclear program with the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=190.96s)]
*  mullahs, with the ayatollahs, with this religious autocracy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  If they start associating the nuclear program with their sovereignty and some kind of protection, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=200.72s)]
*  then we get into a situation where there might be more popular support for the nuclear program, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=206.84s)]
*  which really isn't in our interest when we're looking at leverage over Iran and their regime. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwiC0Nk5XbY&t=211.28s)]
