Video Description: NBC News is reporting the Trump administration plans to limit the classified information it shares with Congress. This comes after a leak of the initial assessment of the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities suggested the bombings were not as successful as President Trump claimed. Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), member of the House Intelligence Committee, tells Chris Jansing he hasn't heard anything from Congress or the committee about limiting intelligence sharing in the future, and hopes for “severe bipartisan pushback” if this were to occur.

# ‘Simply does not add up’: Intel committee member reacts to WH claim to limit sharing with Congress
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60)
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congressman Jason Crowe from Colorado, a former Army Ranger [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=0.0s)]
*  who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=4.2s)]
*  I'll get to those comments in a minute, Congressman, but you serve on the Intelligence Committee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=6.76s)]
*  Have you heard anything about limiting the intel that you get, and what would be the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=11.64s)]
*  effect if that happens? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=16.62s)]
*  I haven't heard anything from Congress or from the committee, and I would hope there [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  would be severe bipartisan pushback on that because it just simply could not work. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=23.12s)]
*  The United States Congress is the only authority that can declare war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=29.2s)]
*  We're the only authority that can pass a budget for the military. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=32.96s)]
*  We're the only authority that actually makes the laws that build our military and provide [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=36.24s)]
*  authorization for intelligence programs, for covert action programs, for basically everything [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=40.4s)]
*  that the Commander-in-Chief does. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  So the idea that we would have limited information or limited intelligence for the first time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=47.08s)]
*  in history simply does not add up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=51.72s)]
*  Well, it appears that the motivation for this was the leak, and Speaker Johnson was asked [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=55.24s)]
*  about the source of it, and here's what he just said. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=60.88s)]
*  There was a leak, and we're trying to get down to the bottom of that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=64.16s)]
*  It's dangerous and ridiculous that that happened, but we're going to solve that problem, and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=67.72s)]
*  we'll keep the coordination. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=71.8s)]
*  Do you think the leak came from Congress, sir? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=72.8s)]
*  That's my suspicion. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=75.12s)]
*  Possibility that it came from Congress. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=77.8s)]
*  Have you heard any, seen any evidence of that? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=79.84s)]
*  And if it is the case, if a leaker is a member of Congress, should there be consequences? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=82.68s)]
*  I haven't seen or heard any indication of the source of it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=88.2s)]
*  This seems very premature. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=92.0s)]
*  Leaks of any type are dangerous and unacceptable, and there should be an investigation, and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=93.4s)]
*  there should be accountability if there is a leak, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=98.2s)]
*  Just like I called for accountability when the Secretary of Defense and senior members [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  of the administration put war plans and operational plans on an unsecured signal channel, just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=104.7s)]
*  like I called for accountability when top secret documents were found in Donald Trump's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=109.92s)]
*  bathroom in Mar-a-Lago, and on and on. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=113.28s)]
*  We should apply the same standard regardless of the political affiliation of the person, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=116.12s)]
*  and that remains true. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=120.36s)]
*  So let's talk about the briefing that is going to happen tomorrow in the House, the House [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  classified briefing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  What are the key questions you want answered? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=128.6s)]
*  Well, there's two things going on here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=131.0s)]
*  One is, what was the actual legal constitutional justification for Donald Trump actually launching [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=133.54s)]
*  this attack? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=139.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=140.96s)]
*  The president only has authority to launch an offensive operation when it's actually [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=141.96s)]
*  in self-defense, when there is an imminent threat to Americans, to American lives, or [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=145.96s)]
*  U.S. facilities. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  That is a very clear standard. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=153.58s)]
*  The Congress was not given advance notice. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  The Congress was not asked to give authorization, so that standard has to be met. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  We have seen no intelligence that would actually show that standard being met, so that's number [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=162.44s)]
*  one. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=168.12s)]
*  The attack has already happened, so the administration should be able to immediately provide that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=169.44s)]
*  information because in theory they should have it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=174.04s)]
*  The second part is the battle damage assessment from the attack. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  They've made claims about the effectiveness of the attack, you know, obliteration. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=180.68s)]
*  We've all heard these claims. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=184.88s)]
*  Well, I would like to see it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=186.36s)]
*  You know, there have been assessments provided to Congress. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=188.16s)]
*  I would like to see, you know, the full and complete battle damage assessment that they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=191.28s)]
*  claim exists. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=194.44s)]
*  They also should have that information and should be able to provide it immediately. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=195.84s)]
*  Today at the briefing, Chairman Cain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, went into detail [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=199.76s)]
*  that we had not heard before about how extraordinary it was, what was pulled off by the U.S. military. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=205.4s)]
*  I think we can all acknowledge what the pilots, what the refuelers, what everybody involved [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=213.12s)]
*  in that operation did. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=218.32s)]
*  Having said that, you heard Secretary Hagstaff say that questioning the assessment of the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=220.68s)]
*  president, which came that same night within just hours, talking about obliteration, undermines [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  the success of the military who undertook that operation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=233.28s)]
*  Is that the net effect? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=237.4s)]
*  Listen, I can't, I don't think I can more strongly push back and condemn that notion [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=239.24s)]
*  that you can't both criticize a military operation and question as a member of Congress whether [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=247.16s)]
*  it's effective, because that is our constitutional obligation, and at the same time praise the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  service members that carried out something that was a remarkable operation by any metric, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=261.8s)]
*  Doing something like this is extremely dangerous, and they all came back safely. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=262.8s)]
*  The idea that you can't do both of those things at the same time is actually so dangerous. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=267.48s)]
*  To tell a member of Congress, listen, you can't question anything. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=273.76s)]
*  You just have to praise the troops. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=278.0s)]
*  You know, I was a, I'm a combat veteran. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=279.8s)]
*  I did three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a paratrooper and an army ranger, and when [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=281.68s)]
*  I go out to carry out the orders of the commander in chief, I had to know that tough questions [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=286.32s)]
*  were being asked, that we were only being used wisely, we were given the best resources, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=292.24s)]
*  and it's civilian control of the military, it's members of Congress that have the constitutional [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=297.76s)]
*  obligation to ask those questions. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=301.12s)]
*  So yes, we can and we have to do both. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=302.68s)]
*  We're out of time, Congressman, but do you question right now whether or not oversight [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=306.2s)]
*  as laid out in the U.S. Constitution exists? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=311.16s)]
*  Yeah, of course I do, right, because we're not getting information. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=314.64s)]
*  We're just not getting the information that the United States Congress has an obligation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  to receive and a duty to assess, to do our job, and to make sure that we are protecting [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=322.86s)]
*  the American people, that we are defending this nation in the right way as our oath [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=328.44s)]
*  requires us. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=333.08s)]
*  We're simply not getting it right now and it's unacceptable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0gXBmYK60&t=334.26s)]
