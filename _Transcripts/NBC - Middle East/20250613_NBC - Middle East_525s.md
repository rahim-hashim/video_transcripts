# ‘Weak leader’: Dem Rep. blasts Trump amid Israel’s strikes and Iran’s retaliation
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k)
*  As more than 2,000 protests are set to begin against the president's agenda in just hours, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=0.0s)]
*  the Trump administration says it wants the National Guard to play an even bigger role [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  in enforcing that agenda. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=9.8s)]
*  Trump's borders are, Tom Homan tells the Washington Post, quote, they can't make immigration arrests, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=12.24s)]
*  but they can certainly augment for security, transportation, infrastructure, and intelligence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=18.64s)]
*  And Homan says he's open to using the Guard to respond to protests if other cities, quote, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=24.68s)]
*  go down the same path as Los Angeles. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=30.4s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Eugene Vindman of Virginia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=33.72s)]
*  He is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=37.2s)]
*  Welcome, Congressman. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=39.84s)]
*  Good to have you back. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=40.84s)]
*  Great to be here, Michael. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=41.84s)]
*  So many, so many things in concern, particularly, I guess, actually, does Tom Homan have the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=42.84s)]
*  ability to direct the United States military? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=49.84s)]
*  No, he does not. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=52.8s)]
*  He's not in the chain of command. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=54.12s)]
*  He's not a uniformed service member. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=55.4s)]
*  He does not have that authority. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=59.32s)]
*  OK, I just, I was confused for a second. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=60.32s)]
*  That was short and to the point. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=61.32s)]
*  Short and to the point. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  OK, so this, the Atlantic, they had a headline today called Trump's Un-American Parade. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=63.32s)]
*  And this is some of the text I'm going to read from it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=71.32s)]
*  According to reports, parachuters will land on the ellipse where Trump instructed rioters [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=73.6s)]
*  on January 6 to, quote, fight like hell and submit to him a folded American flag. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=78.56s)]
*  All of this will occur on the president's birthday, which spurs the question of whether [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=84.48s)]
*  we're celebrating the country or the man who seeks to dominate it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=88.04s)]
*  Your response? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=91.76s)]
*  Well, look, it is the Army's 250th birthday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=92.76s)]
*  I think we should celebrate it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a glorious storied history. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=97.44s)]
*  I celebrated this morning by actually running with the chief of staff for the Army and the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=99.98s)]
*  secretary of the Army through Arlington, which is a really solemn experience. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  We should be celebrating that instead of President Trump's birthday. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=108.6s)]
*  That's what he's made it about. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=112.72s)]
*  He hasn't made it about the Army's birthday and the history and everything that the Army [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=113.72s)]
*  has done liberating Europe and concentration camps. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=118.32s)]
*  He's made it about himself. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=122.48s)]
*  I think that's a shame and it's a lost opportunity for the 250th birthday of the Army. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  I appreciate that thought. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=128.24s)]
*  And I wish more will focus on what you just said and what this really is about, 250 years [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=130.88s)]
*  of a storied journey for the men and women who don that uniform and to stand on that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=138.16s)]
*  wall to protect this great country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  My thoughts is we don't have that individual currently now leading the Department of Defense. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=148.68s)]
*  And I'd like to share with you an exchange that you had with the secretary of defense [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  on the hearing on whether he should apologize for Signalgate to the mother of an F-18 pilot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=160.36s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=169.52s)]
*  I spoke to the mother of one F-18 pilot who flew the March 15th mission over the Red Sea [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  in Yemen that you discussed over signal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  I spoke to her again on Tuesday and asked her if there was anything she wanted me to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  bring up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=184.8s)]
*  She believes that you need to resign. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  She also had several questions, but one thing she said she'd appreciate an apology. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=188.72s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=192.92s)]
*  Do you think you owe her an apology? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=193.92s)]
*  Please make sure to let her know how grateful we are for the skill and heroism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=196.72s)]
*  We're talking about what you did and accountability. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Are you going to apologize to the mother or not? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't apologize for success. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=206.8s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=211.28s)]
*  That's pretty shameful, isn't it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=212.28s)]
*  It's incredibly shameful. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=213.6s)]
*  My view of that, Congressman, is that's the sum and substance of the man in the job. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=216.48s)]
*  As we are celebrating over the next few weeks and years, the men and women who carried the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=227.12s)]
*  flag in the battle, wore the uniform for the country, men and women like yourself who leave [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=236.4s)]
*  military life come into public service, whether some of the highest officers in the land or [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=242.98s)]
*  not. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=250.06s)]
*  This is a time of reflection in many ways. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  You're asking that question wasn't just a question about one mother, but a lot of moms [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=255.42s)]
*  and a lot of families whose sons and daughters serve in harm's way. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=261.86s)]
*  That's the response from the Secretary of Defense. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=267.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=269.3s)]
*  When America's mothers and fathers put their trust and confidence in the uniform and civilian [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=270.46s)]
*  leaders of this country, that is enormous responsibility. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=279.02s)]
*  They expect us to take that seriously. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=285.18s)]
*  What we saw from the Secretary is that zero accountability. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=287.46s)]
*  What he did was obviously a violation that even a private would know was not appropriate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=291.29999999999995s)]
*  That mother, her son could not tell her where the aircraft carrier Truman was, and the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=297.9s)]
*  Secretary divulged that information, and now he refuses to apologize for that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=303.78s)]
*  That means he hasn't learned anything. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=309.58s)]
*  Five minutes is not a long time, but in that five minutes, we were able to demonstrate [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=311.94s)]
*  not only that the Secretary lied to the committee meeting, that he hasn't learned anything in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=315.73999999999995s)]
*  four and a half months because he couldn't answer basic simple questions on the Chinese [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=323.98s)]
*  fleet and how many ships are in the Chinese fleet, but also demonstrated his complete [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=329.18s)]
*  disregard for the family members and service members by refusing to take any responsibility [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  and shameful. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=339.26s)]
*  Can we take a turn and talk for a minute about the breaking news that is actively the developing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=341.86s)]
*  situation in the Middle East? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=346.78s)]
*  On Friday, Israel, the Israeli military launched a massive attack on Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=348.98s)]
*  They killed top military leaders, nuclear scientists, so on and so forth in Iran, and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=355.66s)]
*  the Israeli government said that they will continue as necessary. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  Iran has now launched retaliatory missiles into Israel, and I just keep thinking about [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=367.3s)]
*  that Donald Trump said he was going to end all these wars. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  He was going to restore peace, and now a new war seems to be developing right before our [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=377.34s)]
*  eyes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=384.06s)]
*  Yeah, well, what you see is the world recognizing that we have a weak leader. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=385.06s)]
*  He said he was going to end the war in 24 hours. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=390.26s)]
*  In Ukraine, he failed to do that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=392.46s)]
*  He started a war in Yemen and with, at a great expense, achieving minimal results. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=394.9s)]
*  There was a conflict between India and Pakistan that flared up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=402.74s)]
*  There are conflicts that are really brushfires around the world now, and they see that the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=406.78s)]
*  United States is stepping back, that the president is weak, the administration is weak, filled [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  with frankly unqualified people, and this is what happens when America retreats from [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  its role as a leader. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=424.05999999999995s)]
*  It's easy to start a war. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=427.41999999999996s)]
*  The Israelis have a right to defend themselves. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=428.94s)]
*  Obviously, Iran has been a destabilizing force across the world and across the region for [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  decades. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=437.41999999999996s)]
*  They were refining uranium to achieve nuclear breakout within days, but at the same time, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  it's easy to start a war like this, and it's hard to see where it ends, and I fear that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  the consequences are not just going to be regional, but they're going to be global. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=450.02s)]
*  Along those lines, a UN watchdog agency that specifically has—for lack of a better term, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  this is the agency that does the check-ins, if you will, with Iran and whatnot. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=459.78s)]
*  For the first time in 20 years, they said Iran had missed its check-in time, that they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=464.14s)]
*  were concerned, and this was days ago. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=469.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=471.85999999999996s)]
*  Again, Israel has a right to defend itself, but the United States has to play a meaningful, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=472.85999999999996s)]
*  constructive role, and it's hard to say where this conflict ends. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=479.05999999999995s)]
*  Now we have both sides trading attacks and it's a dangerous environment. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=484.94s)]
*  And the US is on the sidelines. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=491.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what our military's elite and leaders have said. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're deploying forces in American cities instead of focusing where we need to be. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbK5coTg8k&t=498.22s)]
