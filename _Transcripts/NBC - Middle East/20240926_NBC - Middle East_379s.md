# ‘This is why the diplomacy is so important’: Samantha Power discusses U.S. aid to the Middle East
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY)
*  Joining me now, U.S. AID Administrator Samantha Power, who's the former U.S. Ambassador to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=0.0s)]
*  the United Nations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=6.12s)]
*  It's so good to see you, Administrator Power. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=7.92s)]
*  The U.N. Secretary General is warning that hell is breaking loose in Lebanon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=10.24s)]
*  What are the ramifications of more people in this region being displaced? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=14.6s)]
*  Well, the world doesn't need another conflict, that's for sure. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=19.72s)]
*  There's more conflict happening right now around the world that at any point since World [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=25.52s)]
*  War II, more displacement and the humanitarian needs in most of the ongoing conflicts like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=29.6s)]
*  Sudan, like Ukraine heading into winter, and of course like Gaza where infrastructure has [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=35.88s)]
*  been decimated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=40.64s)]
*  Those needs are outpacing the resources that we're able to dedicate to them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=42.52s)]
*  So this is why the diplomacy is so important. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=47.44s)]
*  This is why the call for a 21-day ceasefire to work through the legitimate security concerns [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=49.44s)]
*  that people have, why that is so important. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  We just, again, hope and we'll work tirelessly to try to ensure that that ceasefire appeal [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=57.48s)]
*  is embraced. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=62.24s)]
*  In Lebanon, as you said, 90,000 new people displaced. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=63.76s)]
*  That's on top of 110,000 who had been displaced in the tit-for-tat and of course 70,000 civilians [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=67.48s)]
*  in northern Israel as well out of their homes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=73.8s)]
*  So all that will happen with further escalation is more pain, more displacement. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  There has to be a diplomatic path to working through the security issues. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=82.48s)]
*  The UN's most senior official overseeing aid and reconstruction in Gaza said that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=86.12s)]
*  the international community is collectively failing innocent civilians, not for lack of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=90.2s)]
*  trying. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  The situation, according to that UN official, is just a significant catastrophe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  Can more to be done to help the people in Gaza? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=104.0s)]
*  I mean, more supplies have to flow into Gaza. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  There is also lawlessness that is gang-induced inside Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=112.12s)]
*  But aid workers still don't feel sufficiently safe even moving from point A to point B to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  reach these desperate civilians. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=121.72s)]
*  So again, we have to see an end to the incidents where clearly marked vehicles are fired at. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  There has to be better civilian protection, civilians who come out to food distributions [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=130.84s)]
*  don't feel safe even when it's a UN distribution or one of our trusted NGO partners. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=134.8s)]
*  And that's about, again, the IDF being much more careful about the way they conduct military [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=140.6s)]
*  operations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=145.4s)]
*  The one good thing is the polio vaccination seems to have worked. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=147.2s)]
*  I want to ask you about a dissension within the administration. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  There were reports that in April, USAID submitted a report to the State Department that Israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=154.04s)]
*  was blocking medical aid and food. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=159.56s)]
*  And of course, if that were deemed to be happening, that would mean the US would cut off weapons. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=161.4s)]
*  In May, the secretary told Congress that Israel was not blocking aid or that it was not a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  significant factor. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=176.04s)]
*  So the president clearly and the secretary decided to discount the findings by their [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  own agency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=183.68s)]
*  Well, I think the secretary, the president, everyone has been clear that more aid needed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=185.88s)]
*  to flow, that there were too many blockages at different stages. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  There's been modest improvements over time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=198.84s)]
*  But like I said just before, that these processes have to be streamlined. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=201.08s)]
*  We're heading into winter. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  We saw with polio what can happen when there is political will, the security hours of tranquility [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=206.5s)]
*  that allowed that first shot of the polio vaccination or the first reaching of children [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  to occur. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=220.88s)]
*  We now need the second to occur in the coming weeks. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=221.88s)]
*  But that is proof of concept. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=223.8s)]
*  We need exactly that kind of political will, political leadership and security enabling [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=225.96s)]
*  environment in order to prepare Gazans for this brutal winter that lies ahead. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=231.6s)]
*  And remember, Andrea, I was on probably last year talking about how bad the conditions [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=235.96s)]
*  were. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=239.72s)]
*  This year, you don't have RAFA. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=240.72s)]
*  You don't have buildings into which people can flow, even if they're overcrowded. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  It's all tarps and extremely rudimentary conditions on the beach and in a humanitarian zone, a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  that is actually smaller than Dulles Airport, where 1.5 million people have now congregated. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=255.64s)]
*  So I think whatever about any internal deliberations that we may have and a report from months [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=261.12s)]
*  ago, our focus is on how finally do we get the equivalent of an easy pass for humanitarian [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=268.32s)]
*  assistance so that in advance of a brutal winter, people can be reached. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=275.24s)]
*  I know, and at times, Caram Shalom and the RAFA crossing are closed and aid can't get [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=279.6s)]
*  in. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  I do want to ask you about something that you and UNICEF are working in partnership [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  on, which is trying to eliminate lead that is poisoning children in low and middle income [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=290.2s)]
*  countries. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=297.12s)]
*  And these numbers are staggering. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=298.12s)]
*  Tell me about that joint effort. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, thank you for raising it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=302.04s)]
*  There's almost no awareness of this, not only in our country, about what's happening in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=304.64s)]
*  developing countries, but in the countries themselves. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  At the height of the Flint, Michigan lead crisis here in this country, one in 20 kids [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=310.8s)]
*  had lead poisoning. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=315.24s)]
*  Right now in developing countries, it's one in two. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=316.64s)]
*  And the global investment in addressing this scourge is about $15 million, which is a tiny [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=319.76s)]
*  fraction of what we collectively have invested in dealing with diseases of much lower burdens [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=325.8s)]
*  or much lower prevalence. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  We've launched this coalition with 10 times that amount, with $150 million. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=334.72s)]
*  We have 60 partners, 25 countries. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=338.52s)]
*  But the more that people are aware that there is still lead in paint, lead in spices, lead [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=341.56s)]
*  in cosmetics, lead that comes out of battery recycling, the more we will see, I think, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  a ground swell similar to what has occurred in advanced economies over time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=350.48s)]
*  And we can prevent kids from being poisoned. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=355.04s)]
*  And that's a really important cause. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRd6XwqJ3yY&t=357.28000000000003s)]
