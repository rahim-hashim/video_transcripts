# 'Beginning of the end': Israeli spokesperson reacts to Hamas leader Sinwar's death
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0)
*  What is the death of Yaya Sinwar mean for the war in Gaza? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=0.0s)]
*  Pinksy, thank you for having me join you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=6.4s)]
*  I'll tell you what it means immediately. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=8.36s)]
*  I heard the news as the news came on, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=10.68s)]
*  a loud uproar came from across the street. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=14.4s)]
*  That's a family which had lost a soldier [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=18.36s)]
*  fighting this war against this evil terrorist regime. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=21.52s)]
*  So the first essence that we have is, of course, justice. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=26.24s)]
*  This was an evil killer that was given multiple ways out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  to avoid the destruction of his own people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=35.04s)]
*  Not having induced killing of one thousand two hundred of my people, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=38.44s)]
*  he never took that route and he paid the price as others have paid the price. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=44.0s)]
*  Like Nasrallah, like Daif, like other terrorists, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=49.96s)]
*  the prime minister has made crystal clear this evening [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=53.84s)]
*  that this will be the end of terrorists that seek to threaten Israel, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  whether close to us, be even a little bit more further afield. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=61.88s)]
*  We will defend ourselves while always having one hand out to peace. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=65.8s)]
*  We will defend ourselves. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=69.88s)]
*  But this war will be over when we get our one hundred and one hostages home safely. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, many of them are dead, but many are still alive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  Is this going to be a moment for peace? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=80.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu a moment ago said the war continues. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=84.24s)]
*  Is this going to change things or will Israel continue the bombardment of Gaza? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=87.56s)]
*  The prime minister made clear just this evening that this is the beginning of the end [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  because one hundred and one of our hostages still remain in Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=101.72s)]
*  We will continue to fight until we bring them all home. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=106.48s)]
*  The prime minister made a remarkable offer this evening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=110.76s)]
*  He said to those Hamas terrorists holding our hostages, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=114.64s)]
*  he says, set the hostages free and you can leave the territory with your life. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=119.4s)]
*  Who do you negotiate with without Sinwar? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=126.0s)]
*  Who do the Israelis negotiate with to get those hostages back? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=128.56s)]
*  Well, of course, for over a year now, we've been trying to negotiate with Sinwar. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=133.08s)]
*  It hasn't worked, except for a brief moment in November when we managed to bring our hostages home. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=137.0s)]
*  This is a genocidal terrorist organization that doesn't abide to the same norms as other societies. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=143.24s)]
*  They're genocidal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=152.8s)]
*  They wish to destroy us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=154.0s)]
*  Katie, one thing which you guys don't seem to get in the States, when they say they wish to wipe this place, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=155.4s)]
*  they wish to wipe this country off the face of the earth. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=161.44s)]
*  We believe them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=163.84s)]
*  Iran are backing them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=164.88s)]
*  That's why we need to fight for our survival. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  But we are making tremendous progress one by one. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=170.4s)]
*  We are taking down these terrorists. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=174.0s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=176.0s)]
*  You've taken down Hanaya. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=177.04s)]
*  You've taken down Nasrallah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=179.04s)]
*  You've taken down now Sinwar. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=180.64s)]
*  Who do you negotiate now with? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=182.88s)]
*  You said you have one hand out toward peace. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=184.88s)]
*  Who do you negotiate now with to get that peace? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=187.2s)]
*  Who can the Israelis talk to to get the hostages back? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=190.48s)]
*  Certainly the hostage families are calling for an immediate end to this so that they can get their loved ones home. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=193.28s)]
*  They're very worried about retaliation in the face of the killing of Sinwar. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=200.4s)]
*  The hostages are first and foremost. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  The prime minister made clear this evening that they are our highest priority. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=210.16s)]
*  He used the word highest priority. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=214.24s)]
*  Now, the prime minister made an unprecedented offer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=217.32s)]
*  He said, set them free and you can leave with your life. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  That is an unprecedented offer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=224.04s)]
*  Now, this is the first day of the day after Hamas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=226.2s)]
*  There will come a time when Gaza can be led by Gazans that do not wish the destruction of Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  That is what we're asking for. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=238.28s)]
*  We're looking for partners in the outside world. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=239.64s)]
*  Some of them have come forward. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=242.44s)]
*  I'm not going to name them this evening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=243.72s)]
*  But there are, of course, nations, moderate Arab nations in our region that wish to support the future of the Gazans. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=246.68s)]
*  But Gaza can no longer be run by elements that wish to destroy this country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=254.52s)]
*  That's very interesting what you're talking about. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=260.2s)]
*  I was just talking about it with Eamon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=262.44s)]
*  We heard the other week the Jordanian foreign minister say that the Arab nations surrounding Israel can guarantee Israel's security. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=264.28s)]
*  Are you working with the Jordanians, with the Egyptians, with the Qataris, with the Kuwaitis to find a way to scaffold what's left of Gaza so that there can be a two state solution? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=272.76s)]
*  There can be peace, that Gaza can be run by Gazans. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=287.64s)]
*  The prime minister has already made clear that Gaza should be run by Gazans. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=295.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be run by Israel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=298.36s)]
*  In the short term, it may have to be. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=299.96s)]
*  But in the longer term, we don't want to run Gaza. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=302.28s)]
*  That's for Gazans to run their own life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  But Gazans that wish to live with us in peace, not Gazans that wish to destroy us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  And Nasrallah and the other terrorists like Sinwar sought to portray themselves as lions, as guardians of the Palestinian future. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=312.76s)]
*  They brought nothing but destruction to their own people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=323.24s)]
*  This was a war designed by Sinwar himself to bring destruction to his own people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=326.28s)]
*  There can be a better future for Gazans and for Israelis. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  But of course, the bare minimum must be that our nation state can no longer be under threat from these terrorist organizations that wish to destroy us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  With Iran, the key principle. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=347.32s)]
*  I began this show by noting what Sinwar had said in an Israeli prison to a dentist, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=350.84s)]
*  that he was willing to sacrifice 10, 20, 100,000 people for his cause of eradicating Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=357.32s)]
*  You just mentioned a moment ago that Israel might need to be in Gaza, to run Gaza for the short term. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  Can you elaborate on that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, the prime minister over the last year has set out his vision for the day after Hamas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=373.32s)]
*  We're getting closer to that day. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=379.0s)]
*  But ultimately, as I say, it will be run by Gazans that do not wish us harm, that wish to provide a better future for their own people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=381.32s)]
*  Gaza has been flooded by international money, well-meaning money. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=390.28s)]
*  But unfortunately, that money has been sunk into terrorism, building a terror network, a tunnel network bigger than the London Underground or the New York subway. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=394.6s)]
*  Instead of building up Gaza with better schools and hospitals and roads and better future for their children, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  there is a tremendous amount of brainwashing which has happened in Gaza to Gazans. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=412.76s)]
*  It'll take a while to take forward that de-radicalization. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=419.08s)]
*  Can Israel do that, or should other Arab states be in charge of that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=422.36s)]
*  Do you think Israel can, as you said, de-radicalize? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=425.56s)]
*  Do they have the goodwill to de-radicalize people in Gaza who've suffered bombardment now? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=429.4s)]
*  And I'm not laying blame at anyone's feet, but who have suffered bombardment now for a year? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=435.88s)]
*  Well, first things first, let's make clear that it's Sinwar that started this war. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=441.64s)]
*  There was a ceasefire on October the 6th. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=447.08s)]
*  He started this disastrous war for his own people, let alone my people. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=449.4s)]
*  But ultimately, look, if it's Israel that's taking forward this de-radicalization point, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=456.04s)]
*  then it'll be dead on arrival. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=462.44s)]
*  So it must be Gazans themselves, it must be other moderate Arab states that seek a better [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  future for ordinary Gazans, not through battle, through trying to tunnel under us, through sending [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  us rockets. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  We don't want to run Gazans' lives. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=480.04s)]
*  The Prime Minister's made that crystal clear. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=482.52s)]
*  He couldn't have been any clearer. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  We are in discussions with other Arab neighbors in our neighborhood to provide a better future [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=487.24s)]
*  for ordinary Gazans. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=494.2s)]
*  But the bare minimum must be two things. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=495.4s)]
*  It's not Hamas or anyone connected to Hamas, and also that they do not wish to destroy our country. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=497.96s)]
*  This cannot be a better future for Gaza, it cannot be a stopgap on the way to the next [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=504.28s)]
*  attempted invasion of Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=510.76s)]
*  What can you tell me about what you currently know about the remaining hostages? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=512.2800000000001s)]
*  Do you know how many who might still be alive? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=516.76s)]
*  Do you know where they might be? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=519.08s)]
*  Do you know why they might not have been around Yaha Sinwar? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=520.44s)]
*  There was talk that he was surrounding himself with hostages to keep himself safe. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=524.84s)]
*  Katie, Sinwar was running away like the filthy terrorists he hears he was saving his own skin. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  And of course, all of us need to remember that it's Hamas which took these hostages [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=540.52s)]
*  and is still holding them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  We unfortunately know that at least 36 of them are no longer alive, killed by Hamas. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=548.2s)]
*  Some of them taken as dead bodies on October the 7th. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  Some of them unruh employees who took those dead bodies on October the 7th. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=558.52s)]
*  But we know that the others are alive. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=564.44s)]
*  Some of them we think are close by him in Rafa, in other parts of Gaza as well. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=567.32s)]
*  Let's not forget that the whole world, as the Prime Minister made clear this evening, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=573.72s)]
*  said we should not go into Rafa. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=578.44s)]
*  All eyes on Rafa said the social media means. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=580.6s)]
*  We went into Rafa because that's where the leadership of Hamas was. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=585.0s)]
*  And we are taking them apart one by one. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=588.6s)]
*  But the Prime Minister said this evening it is our highest priority. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=592.04s)]
*  Our highest priority to get our people home. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=596.36s)]
*  It's an open sword in Israeli society. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=600.44s)]
*  All of us here, and I think all well-meaning people around the world, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=603.48s)]
*  feel the pain of those families. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=607.48s)]
*  I myself pass them every day and see the pain in their eyes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=609.32s)]
*  It's a human rights outrage that one year on these people are still being held by Hamas. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=612.92s)]
*  But the Prime Minister couldn't have been any clearer this evening. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=618.92s)]
*  He made an offer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=622.04s)]
*  I've never heard the Prime Minister made this offer before. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=623.16s)]
*  He said, set the hostages free and you'll escape with your lives. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=625.64s)]
*  So if anyone from Hamas are watching this program right now in the terror dungeons, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=629.96s)]
*  inside Gaza, holding our hostages, you have an opportunity, endorsed by the Prime Minister, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=635.64s)]
*  set our people free and you will escape with your life. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  Does this change plans for the retaliatory strikes against Iran? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=646.12s)]
*  I tell you, Katie, I don't like that word retaliatory. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=651.24s)]
*  I prefer the word defense. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=657.72s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we were hit by 181 ballistic missiles. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=660.04s)]
*  No other country has ever faced a ballistic barrage from any country. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=664.2s)]
*  It's Iran, of course. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=669.08s)]
*  Iran say to us openly they wish to destroy our country. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=670.44s)]
*  Iran backed Sinwa. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=673.88s)]
*  Iran trained Sinwa. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=675.8s)]
*  The fighters, the tactics which Hamas have used over the last year are Iranian tactics. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=677.88s)]
*  So we know that this is behind all of this evil. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=684.84s)]
*  And I'll be straight with you, Katie. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel knows precisely, precisely how to defend itself against Iran. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=691.8s)]
*  We do not seek war with Iran. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=698.68s)]
*  Our Minister, Ron Dermott, for strategic affairs has made that very clear. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  The Iranian people themselves are very much victims of the Iranian regime. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=704.6s)]
*  But the regime itself seeks to destroy this country. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=711.0s)]
*  We will not let that happen. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  And we know precisely, precisely how to defend ourselves. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdOj3rzPc0&t=716.36s)]
