# Trump ‘trying a new approach’ by negotiating directly with Hamas: Fmr. FBI special agent weighs in
**NBC - Middle East:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc)
*  And joining us now is former FBI special agent and MSNBC national security analyst Clint Watts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see you, Clint. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=5.8s)]
*  So Axios reports that Israel objected to the Trump administration's direct talks with Hamas, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  noting Israel found out about it through other channels, not from U.S. officials. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=12.72s)]
*  The U.S. designates Hamas as a terrorist organization and historically does not negotiate with them or other terrorist organizations. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  So what does the administration think it could gain from breaking that position? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=24.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was a wild turn for me, looking back over 25 years post 9-11, Hamas being the terrorist group, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=28.28s)]
*  the U.S. doesn't negotiate with terrorists. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=35.4s)]
*  But I would say just if we zoom out a little bit, looking at both the scenarios with Russia threatening sanctions, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=38.24s)]
*  also with Hamas trying to negotiate independently, what you're seeing is the Trump administration trying an alternative approach. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=45.16s)]
*  Whether you like the positions or not, they're coming in with a totally different prescription for how they want to negotiate with everyone, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=53.52s)]
*  going bilateral than multilateral with a lot of different entities and trying to push and pull on both sides. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Interesting approach. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=66.0s)]
*  The challenge of the Trump administration to the Biden administration was the Biden administration stuck with a national security establishment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=68.48s)]
*  that was very traditional over many, many decades. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=76.48s)]
*  Now, whether that will make any meaningful gains or not, I think it is to be seen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  But I think it's a different approach that we're not used to. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=85.16s)]
*  If I'd been on air with you, whether it was Bush Obama, you know, 20 years ago, we wouldn't see an approach like this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=87.56s)]
*  It would be quite consistent, actually, with most of these countries. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=94.92s)]
*  So the administration paused sending military supplies and sharing intelligence with Ukraine this week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=98.6s)]
*  How specifically does this hurt Ukraine's war efforts? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Let's focus more on the intelligence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=106.88s)]
*  I mean, obviously, if they're not getting the military supplies they need, we can figure out how that affects it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=108.76s)]
*  But intelligence wise, what happens without the U.S. help? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=113.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think Ukraine becomes very limited to whatever is mostly what we would call tactical or operational intelligence on the battlefield. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=118.44s)]
*  Things that they know may be a little bit of regional intelligence, but on a grand scale, not really understanding what Russia is doing or vis-a-vis the allies and partners. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  A lot of the intelligence that was coming to Ukraine likely comes from a mix of NATO, the EU and the U.S. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=134.16s)]
*  U.S. being the dominant player in all that, much more capable, much more types of intelligence that would go to Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=139.72s)]
*  So it would limit things like broad-based targeting, understanding situations on the battlefield. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=148.16s)]
*  But it's in a much more defensive posture and really relying only on the sensors that they have. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  Just looking forward, that would really handicap their ability to really take on any sort of more aggressive action like we've seen over the last six months vis-a-vis Russia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=157.84s)]
*  All of this seems to be a play to try and get Ukraine to the negotiation table. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=167.84s)]
*  Have the tariffs sort of acclaimed by President Trump on the Russians, same thing on the Russian side, trying to really force a peace agreement in a very rapid period of time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=172.12s)]
*  Yeah, let's face it, Russia could become more aggressive as the winter weather wanes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that would allow them to step things up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=187.0s)]
*  Let me get to what NBC News and some others report, and that is that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth halted offensive cyber operations against Russia. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  How critical are these operations to our U.S. national security, Clinton? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=198.32s)]
*  If reports are true, could it be leveraged to get Russia to the negotiating table somehow? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  It seems that is the strategy, Alex, is to remove some of the pressure against Russia and hopes that it would bring Russia to the negotiation table. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=210.08s)]
*  This is a quest and a campaign promise of President Trump to first hundred days in the war Russia-Ukraine. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=218.24s)]
*  Now, just knowing Russia having worked on it for a very long time, that is not likely how Russia will interpret it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  Instead, they would see that as a concession and a concession in the lead up to peace negotiations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  Two parts of the battlefield in Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=237.56s)]
*  One is on the ground, the physical kinetic war that we see every day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Second part is in the air and online, which is a mix of missile attacks, air attacks and cyber attacks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  And if this is the signal to Russia, there's standard strategy for any negotiation is called maximum pressure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=248.48s)]
*  If the West or the EU, the United States gives any ground, Russia's automatic response is to double down and try and gain more ground, such that when they come to the negotiation table, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  they're operating at more strength instead of more weakness. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  So what you'll see is more cyber attacks, more offensive operations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  These are the missile attacks you've seen even on Zelensky's hometown in recent days. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  They're going to double down and try and gain as much ground as they can. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  So when they come to the negotiation table, if they give up something, they're actually moving up to what was maybe now a week or two ago versus what their present situation is, which they've made more gains. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=279.36s)]
*  OK, Clint Watts, always appreciate your sage insights on these things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  See you again soon. Thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgshiIQGdc&t=293.12s)]
