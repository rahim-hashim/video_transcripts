# War ‘about to enter new phase’ in Lebanon after Israel strikes central Beirut
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec)
*  Joining us now from Beirut is NBC News international correspondent Matt Bradley, also with us is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador Alon Pincus, former Israeli Consul General in New York. Matt, what do we know about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=5.12s)]
*  these special operations Israel is conducting right now? And there was a difference between [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=10.48s)]
*  the bombing that it just carried out in Beirut and the one that killed the Hezbollah leader. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=15.68s)]
*  That's right. So we're hearing now from the Israelis saying that they've been conducting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=24.64s)]
*  ground operations in southern Lebanon, but they were specific. They were very careful to say that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=28.0s)]
*  these are limited ground operations. They're coming and going, it sounds like, and they don't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=32.8s)]
*  necessarily mean that there's about to be a ground invasion. However, we're also hearing from, we [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=36.88s)]
*  heard from Yoav Golan, he's the Defense Minister of Israel, just in the past couple of hours, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=42.4s)]
*  that the war is about to enter a new phase here in Lebanon. And this comes after we've heard [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=46.96s)]
*  reporting from the Washington Post and CBS News saying that Israeli officials have told Washington [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  that a ground invasion could be imminent now. NBC News has not yet backed that up, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=57.2s)]
*  but it sounds as though, and I hate to make predictions, especially about the Middle East, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  I've told you this before, Jose, but it sounds as though all indicators are pointing to the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=65.92s)]
*  potential for a ground invasion at any moment. That's what we've been hearing, that this is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=70.72s)]
*  imminent. And of course, we heard it, like I just said, from Yoav Golan himself, that we're about to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=75.12s)]
*  enter a new phase. So preparations are being made. It looks as though Israel is kind of tenderizing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=79.44s)]
*  the ground. They've not only been doing what they've been doing for the past two weeks, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=85.28s)]
*  which is shooting down top Hezbollah officials and major installations that have belonged to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=89.12s)]
*  Hezbollah. Now it looks as though they've expanded their attacks and are now trying to attack leaders [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=94.8s)]
*  of other groups like Hamas. We had a confirmation from Hamas that overnight one of their leaders [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=99.36s)]
*  was killed. And also this left-wing group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=104.88s)]
*  which has been around for generations, but our audience probably doesn't know much about. They're [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=110.8s)]
*  not really major players and haven't been a household name for quite a long time. Still, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=115.04s)]
*  three of their leaders were killed here in Beirut by an Israeli drone strike, or what is believed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=120.64s)]
*  to be a drone strike. And that was actually the first attack by the Israelis into central Beirut [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  since 2006, which also happens to be the last time the Israelis launched a ground incursion [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=133.52s)]
*  into Lebanon. So all of these indicators taken together. And again, I don't like to make [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  predictions because I always end up being wrong, but this does look as though we're starting to see [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=143.6s)]
*  Israel preparing for some sort of ground incursion. It could be they could see as some sort of final [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  swipe at Hezbollah as they've been picking off their leadership for much of the past two weeks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=153.84s)]
*  Matt Bradley in Beirut for us. Thank you very much. Ambassador, what's your read of the situation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=160.24s)]
*  right now? Is Israel clearly is beginning preparations for something very probable, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=165.68s)]
*  ground operation in Lebanon? Well, the question is, how do you define ground operation and how [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=171.68s)]
*  do you define limit? If the idea to borrow from the Vietnam War tactics, a search and destroy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  mission, which is what basically we're seeing today, that's understandable, which means that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=184.72s)]
*  there is a swath, let's say it's 10, 15 kilometers long, north of the Israeli border, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=192.96s)]
*  and there are Hezbollah strongholds over there, Hezbollah military concentrations, small, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=201.04s)]
*  but they do fire mortar. They do fire rockets into northern Israel, and that needs to be dealt with. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=207.44s)]
*  Now the question is, Jose, whether or not this is going to be a search and destroy, or is Israel [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  really planning on a ground operation that includes in terms of duration and use of power, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=221.04s)]
*  carving out a security zone? Now I fail to see the benefits of that. I fail to see the advantages [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  of that because on paper and in planning, these limited operations seem magnificently efficient, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=234.55999999999997s)]
*  but when push comes to shove and you start invading, even if you call it an incursion, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  and even if you define it as limited, you end up in a sitting duck kind of situation. So I truly hope [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  that there won't be a need for a big scale ground operation, but like your correspondent in Lebanon, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=255.28s)]
*  Matt said, you never know. Ambassador, if you would just give us a little bit of a better idea [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=263.12s)]
*  from your perspective on what Hezbollah is, and we've been hearing for so long that it has 130,000 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=272.32s)]
*  men in arms and that they have more than 100,000 missiles, and they're certainly well-financed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=280.72s)]
*  by Iran, yet in these last couple of weeks, when they first started getting, you know, exploding [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  bombs in Iran for a Hamas leader, but for Hezbollah leaders, and then the Pagers and the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=297.6s)]
*  Walkie Talkies and then now the bombing, there hasn't been a massive response by Hezbollah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=306.64s)]
*  They have no doubt thrown missiles into Israel, but how would you describe Hezbollah today? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=314.08s)]
*  Well, that's a great question, Jose, and I don't think anyone has a definitive answer. Let me try, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=322.72s)]
*  let me give you two different perspectives in short. One is that it was always a paper tiger. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=329.36s)]
*  If you recall, if our viewers recall, there was this myth about the Red Army, the Soviet Red Army, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=335.84s)]
*  and once the wall fell down and the Soviet Union disintegrated, everyone found out that it was all [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=341.52s)]
*  rotting, that it was all, you know, a make-belief, that it was far from being the modern, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  overbearing military machine that people thought. It was all rusty. So maybe that's the case here, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=356.64s)]
*  that they do have 100,000 fighters and they do have 100,000 rockets and missiles, but it's not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  exactly a modern fighting force. That's one way of looking at it. The other is that the danger [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  is still there, that taking out, assassinating Hassan Massallah, the secretary general for the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=376.24s)]
*  last 32 years, and indeed the upper echelon of Hezbollah does not seriously or did not seriously [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  affect their formidable missile launching capability. And they still have that capability, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=388.48s)]
*  and they still are probably a state within it, well, they are a state within the state, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=394.56s)]
*  but probably or arguably the strongest paramilitary non-state military force in the world, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=398.88s)]
*  which is why this is an ongoing thing. But there's no question about it that Hezbollah suffered a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=405.36s)]
*  major strategic blow with the elimination of Mr. Nasrallah and the top echelon, that top layer of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=412.4s)]
*  military and political commanders. There's also another issue which is related to what you just [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=421.44s)]
*  asked, Jose, and that is to what extent would Iran really go to stand by Hezbollah? Because as you [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=427.12s)]
*  know, the nature of the beast is as follows. The proxies fight for me. I fight for the proxies. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=434.08s)]
*  I don't know what Iran is going to do so far. They've shown a lot of restraint, to be fair. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=442.64s)]
*  Ambassador Alonpigas, it's always a pleasure. I thank you very much for your time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Jose, always. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QTtZhVbec&t=453.44s)]
