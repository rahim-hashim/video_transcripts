Video Description: Lucas Kunce, an Afghanistan Marine veteran running for Senate in Missouri, joined Stephanie Ruhle to share how he feels about the latest in Afghanistan as the U.S. troop withdrawal deadline nears and evacuations continue. He slams officials calling for an extension of the Tuesday deadline. "The same people right now who are saying one more day, one more month, one more dollar are the same people who said that for 20 years ... what that means is one more Marine," he says.

# Afghanistan Veteran: 'The Taliban Taking Over Was Absolutely Inevitable'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0)
*  Lucas, I know you think the chaos that we saw was bound to happen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=5.84s)]
*  And what do you want to see now? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=6.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=8.44s)]
*  Hi, Stephanie. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=9.44s)]
*  So, so for me, what, what was inevitable was the fact that the Taliban was going to take [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=10.44s)]
*  that country over. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And you know, I didn't always think that, but in 2014, actually 2012, 13, and then again [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=16.84s)]
*  in 14, I went to Afghanistan and I actually, I learned the language, Pashto, the language [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=22.04s)]
*  of southern Afghanistan and Marine Special Operations Command before I went. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=27.16s)]
*  And on those deployments, I spoke to Taliban. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=31.44s)]
*  I worked with Afghan security forces. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=34.72s)]
*  I talked to locals and like after we, this is 2014, let's say 2014, 13 years after we [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  had been there, my job was still to do all of the logistics for our partner force so [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=43.0s)]
*  that they wouldn't get overrun by the Taliban. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=48.44s)]
*  I mean, like food, water, ammunition, equipment, literally everything after 13 years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=50.88s)]
*  And I remember, like, I remember interviewing a member of the Taliban in the Harat city [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  penitentiary at one point. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  And I asked this guy, you know, do you know why you're in here? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=64.16s)]
*  And he just looks me straight in the eyes and he says, yes, because I was trying to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  kill you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=72.28s)]
*  I said, okay, well, where do you think this goes from here? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=73.28s)]
*  And he said, well, you know, two things can happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  You can let me out and I'll keep trying to kill you until you're gone. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=80.72s)]
*  Or you can leave me in here and eventually you guys are going to be gone and it's going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  to be my country again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=88.4s)]
*  And when you just take the full picture of all that stuff that I saw, the Taliban taking [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  over was absolutely inevitable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=94.42s)]
*  And anyone who was telling you otherwise was being dishonest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=96.68s)]
*  And that's sort of exactly it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=102.2s)]
*  We don't have the full picture. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=103.56s)]
*  For the last two weeks, a lot of people have been blaming the Afghan army for not putting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=105.36s)]
*  up a fight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  You say it is not that simple. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain to us why? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  And so, I mean, the Afghan National Security Forces was essentially a U.S.-funded job [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  program. And so we spent 20 years there, about two point three trillion dollars and about [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=122.4s)]
*  twenty five hundred U.S. service members lost their lives there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=128.12s)]
*  And that was to prop up a system that was that was entirely corrupt. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=131.6s)]
*  And when I say corrupt, like I don't just mean on the Afghan side, which is terrible, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=136.28s)]
*  but terrible, but also on the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=140.72s)]
*  side. I mean, everybody wanted to keep us in this war when it was very clear to people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=142.44s)]
*  on the ground that we weren't accomplishing everything because there were a lot. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=147.28s)]
*  There was a lot of money involved. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=151.12s)]
*  And so and there was a lot of reputational stake involved, too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=152.68s)]
*  And so no one was willing to admit what was actually happening there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=155.96s)]
*  And what you saw was just this deep, systematic, institutional dishonesty propped up by the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=159.88s)]
*  people at the top on in each government, Afghanistan and the United States, because it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=166.04s)]
*  worked for them. And just like with any war in Afghanistan, the people who paid the price [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=171.12s)]
*  were normal, everyday Americans who footed the bill and died over there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=176.6s)]
*  And then Afghans who were also lied to all this time told that, you know, they were [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  actually accomplishing something. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=184.68s)]
*  And when you talk about like the troops on the ground, the Afghan troops, it's really, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=186.32s)]
*  really difficult for me to blame these troops when, in fact, their leaders were taking [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  the food, the ammo, the equipment and everything else before it ever got to them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=194.88s)]
*  So these guys were being asked to fight essentially with with no equipment, no money and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=198.28s)]
*  no food. And that's why, you know, what you saw over the last two weeks with the Taliban [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=202.6s)]
*  just rolling in was absolutely inevitable because that never changed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=206.72s)]
*  It was just a grab and go operation for the people on the top, both in America and in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=210.4s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  Grab and go trillions of dollars. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=218.16s)]
*  I do want to play for you what Congressman Peter Meyer, a veteran who went to Kabul last [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=220.6s)]
*  week, what he said about his trip. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=225.44s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=227.36s)]
*  I mean, we've seen some of the best of the American people, especially in the last two [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=229.6s)]
*  weeks, some of the best of our troops on the ground and the heroic way they're carrying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=233.28s)]
*  out this mission. We've also seen some of the worst of American leadership. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=237.08s)]
*  You agree? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=242.72s)]
*  Look, Mike, well, I absolutely agree about the troops. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=245.24s)]
*  The people who are over there doing this evacuation in very dangerous conditions, as [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  you've seen, are doing absolutely the bravest, most impossible job in the world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm very proud of them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=257.6s)]
*  But as far as the overall picture goes, like, here's the deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=259.24s)]
*  All these people are playing the blame game right now over what's happening right now [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=262.72s)]
*  because they want to distract us from the fact that we spent 20 years, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=266.64s)]
*  two point three trillion dollars and twenty five hundred U.S. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=271.48s)]
*  service member lives over there for absolutely nothing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=275.24s)]
*  Like the same people right now who are saying one more day, one more month, one [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=278.56s)]
*  more dollar are the same people who said that for 20 years. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=283.36s)]
*  And what we saw last week that what that means is one more Marine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=286.68s)]
*  It means one more Marine over and over again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  It reminds me of the saddest day of my entire life, which was standing on the flight [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=293.2s)]
*  line in Helmand, Afghanistan in the middle of the night, watching the fallen body of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=297.24s)]
*  one of the members of my battalion loaded onto a transport plane to go home. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=302.0s)]
*  These people are trying to keep us focused on what's happening right now because they [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  have been telling the American people that it was worthwhile to spend two point three [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=310.56s)]
*  trillion dollars over there for absolutely nothing while they've been refusing to spend [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  that much building up our own country here at home. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=319.44s)]
*  And we can't let them win. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=322.4s)]
*  We have to fight back against that narrative because it's wrong. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=323.64s)]
*  And it's just part of the systematic institutional dishonesty that has us in this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  position right now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighcrYZnWZ0&t=330.71999999999997s)]
