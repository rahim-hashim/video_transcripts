# US Drone Strike In Kabul Mistakenly Killed Civilians, Not Terrorists: Pentagon
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8)
*  Good afternoon. I'm here to brief the results of the investigation I directed following [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=0.0s)]
*  the report of civilian casualties from our strike in Kabul on 29 August. Having thoroughly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  reviewed the findings of the investigation and the supporting analysis by interagency [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=11.0s)]
*  partners, I am now convinced that as many as 10 civilians, including up to seven children, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=15.24s)]
*  were tragically killed in that strike. Moreover, we now assess that it is unlikely that the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=21.36s)]
*  vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or were a direct threat to U.S. forces. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=27.4s)]
*  I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed. This strike [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=33.64s)]
*  was taken in the earnest belief that it would prevent an imminent threat to our forces and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=39.56s)]
*  the evacuees at the airport, but it was a mistake, and I offer my sincere apology. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=44.84s)]
*  As the combatant commander, I am fully responsible for this strike and its tragic outcome. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRpG31MeE8&t=57.4s)]
