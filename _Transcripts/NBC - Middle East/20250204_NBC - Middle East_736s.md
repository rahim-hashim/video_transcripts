# 'Truly outrageous': Trump shocks world with Gaza takeover comments
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY)
*  This is a lot to take in. I mean, I especially like the president. Everyone I have spoken to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=0.0s)]
*  loves the idea of the U.S. owning this territory, though he didn't say who everyone was. I mean, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  for all we know, it was Jared Ivanka and Trump himself. Put into perspective all of this. What [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=12.24s)]
*  do we need to know tonight? Yeah, Steph. Well, first of all, to your point, I also was struck [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=19.92s)]
*  by that. Jared Kushner actually did publicly speak last year in recent months in ways that hinted, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=24.96s)]
*  perhaps, presaged this breathtaking and really outrageous proposal from Donald Trump. It didn't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  come from nowhere in that sense. Jared Kushner definitely has talked about this in terms almost [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=39.92s)]
*  more akin to that of a real estate mogul assessing a piece of land than someone who understands the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=45.68s)]
*  complicated history and the tragedy of the two million people who live there, the tragedy of the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=52.08s)]
*  war with Israel. It's almost as if both Kushner and his father-in-law stripped that out of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=58.48s)]
*  equation. I think what Donald Trump said tonight, it obviously is probably one of the more [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=64.96s)]
*  breathtaking things we've heard him say. It is certainly not previewed in anything he said on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=71.36s)]
*  the campaign trail, although he suggested in his remarks that he had been contemplating this for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=78.88s)]
*  months. He said that he had spoken with many people who approved of this idea, and yet it seems like [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  he hasn't probably talked to a lot of people to socialize this. I noted that Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=90.24s)]
*  was complimentary of Donald Trump, but he did not explicitly endorse this idea. I think many [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=97.28s)]
*  Republicans, not to mention Democrats, would have a hard time swallowing anything like this. It seems [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=103.04s)]
*  that Donald Trump has turned from an America first isolationist into an imperialist almost overnight [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=109.92s)]
*  in the last two weeks. Stunning. Jeff, can we talk about all two million Palestinians? This idea, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=116.4s)]
*  they should go elsewhere. Who has thought this one out? What are they going to pack their suitcases [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=123.2s)]
*  and go where? Well, good question, Steph. I don't have the answer, and really neither did [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=129.44000000000003s)]
*  President Trump tonight when he was asked about it. He said that they would go to other countries, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=134.8s)]
*  that there would be enclaves or areas in other countries that the Palestinians would be able [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  to go to. But we need to look at history, and we also need to look at how the Palestinians have [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=144.08s)]
*  fought to stay exactly where they are. If they wanted to leave, this is an option that they [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=150.0s)]
*  probably would have had before President Trump proposed it today. A couple other points to your [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=154.72s)]
*  broader question. One, I spoke to a historian before coming on air with you tonight who said [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=160.16s)]
*  that historically he can only think of one other president who had made a similar move, and that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=167.68s)]
*  was Andrew Jackson and the American Indians. He called it ethnic cleansing. He also pointed out [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=173.68s)]
*  President Trump's increasingly now expansionist view of the world in addition to Gaza, which is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=179.68s)]
*  the news of the day. He has also called on annexing or bringing on Greenland, making Canada the 51st [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=186.24s)]
*  state and taking back control of the Panama Canal. So he's, as Susan said, certainly not an [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=193.12s)]
*  isolationist, which is largely the policies that his supporters backed when they were voting for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=199.84s)]
*  him. And the proposal that he's making tonight would have an enormous impact on the region and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=207.52s)]
*  on the people who are living there now. Havar, I know Donald Trump has a very good relationship [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  with the Saudis, or he would say that MBS is Jared Kushner's biggest investor. But how are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries going to take in this news tonight? Well, they're not going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=225.84s)]
*  to, they're not, they're certainly not going to like it. And you're right about focusing on MBS [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=231.84s)]
*  because his very first phone call in office, President Trump's was to MBS. So by having that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=235.28s)]
*  and by having, by the way, as well, Netanyahu be the first official visit, he's sending a message [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=241.44s)]
*  that he wants to reset those relationships and he wants to prioritize them and prioritize a deal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  But I can tell you very clearly as somebody who has followed very closely and understands [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=251.44s)]
*  what happened when the PLO went to Jordan in 1970, what happened when the PLO then moved to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=257.36s)]
*  Lebanon in 1974 and you had attempts to overthrow the monarchy in Jordan, a civil war that broke out [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=262.24s)]
*  and lasted 15 years in Lebanon. And then the Palestinians, the PLO in Kuwait, who welcomed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=268.64s)]
*  Saddam Hussein and allowed him to go there, there's not going to be a very strong welcome. There's a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=274.72s)]
*  lot of trepidation. And that's why Egypt and Jordan were very reticent to take refugees, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=278.64s)]
*  Palestinian refugees, which by the way, I have to add, I thought was morally reprehensible of them [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=284.24s)]
*  not to take them at the time to take them temporarily. But they didn't because they were [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=288.0s)]
*  afraid that they would be placed there permanently and because they were afraid of what that could [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=292.96s)]
*  lead, what kind of turmoil that could lead to later. So I don't think they're going to like this plan [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=297.28s)]
*  at all. But when Trump was asked, did Egypt and Jordan say they would take Palestinians, Trump said [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=301.04s)]
*  no, but they will. And so he's going to use USAID probably to twist their arm into taking some [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=307.04s)]
*  refugees, even if it ends up being temporary. Wow. Leigh Ann, Donald Trump, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=312.8s)]
*  would not rule out sending American troops into Gaza. We all know he campaigned as an anti-war [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=317.76s)]
*  candidate. He talked repeatedly about not getting involved with foreign conflicts. Tonight, that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=323.52s)]
*  feels like it's changed. Yeah, a lot has changed after Donald Trump's press conference today, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  alongside Netanyahu. So meanwhile, while he is shutting down the USAID program, he is, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=335.28s)]
*  which Gaza is a recipient of, and also saying that he is no longer going to be a part of UNRWA, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=342.4s)]
*  the aid program from the United Nations, which also Gaza is a big recipient of. Now Donald Trump [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=349.28s)]
*  is saying that he is going to colonize Gaza. So still spending American dollars, but in a very, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=355.84s)]
*  very different way. Now, this is causing lots of questions, to say the least. That's an understatement [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=362.08s)]
*  of what exactly Donald Trump means. What's he specifically going to do? Are there going to be [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=371.36s)]
*  condos, Trump Tower condos, that Gazans are going to be able to afford in Gaza, that Palestinians are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=377.76s)]
*  going to be able to afford in Gaza? And the alarm bells ringing around Capitol Hill, especially [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  among Democrats, of course, but even some Republicans who are saying, hey, I thought we [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=393.12s)]
*  were not going to start, continue this American expansion and imperialism, and going to spend [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=398.8s)]
*  American dollars in the United States. And so this is just the latest of what has been a wild [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=408.16s)]
*  two plus weeks since Donald Trump has been inaugurated. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=416.56s)]
*  Hagar, any reaction tonight from the Palestinians? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=420.4s)]
*  Well, there was immediate outrage from Palestinians, both broad and here. You saw, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=424.88s)]
*  for example, Rashida Tlaib come out, her sister come out against this. But I also want to make sure, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=430.4s)]
*  the thing is, I'm in Washington right now, by the way. I've been here for a few days. I've been [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=436.24s)]
*  talking to folks at the White House, folks across the government. And there seems to be also a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=439.36s)]
*  little bit that President Trump may have pulled a fast one here, because it doesn't seem that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=445.2s)]
*  folks were expecting this. When Steve Woodcoff went to Gaza, and he's one of the first U.S. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=450.32s)]
*  officials to go there in a very long time, he said it was uninhabitable, which it is uninhabitable, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=454.0s)]
*  and wanted to see the Palestinians there live temporarily somewhere in dignity while Gaza was [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=459.2s)]
*  being rebuilt. And that is what I was told. And that's what it seems as though people, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=466.32s)]
*  that was what seemed that was the message when Trump said that he wanted to, quote, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=471.92s)]
*  clean out Gaza and move Palestinians to Jordan. That's possibly what he meant. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=476.4s)]
*  And so I'm not, it's not very clear that this is, that anybody expected him to say this and that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  there is a strategy there. And I want, so I want to be careful in, you know, how serious was he in [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  this? I know that he was pressed. I know he emphasized this and I don't want to be naive about [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  it. But I also sometimes wonder if that ambiguity, if he's trying to play that in, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=497.28s)]
*  to curry favor for himself in negotiations. And so that's the one thing I would question against. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=503.28s)]
*  I don't know, Susan, do you think Donald Trump pulled a fast one here? Because let's go back [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=508.32s)]
*  to the first thing you said. It was almost exactly a year ago. I think it was February 15th at Harvard [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  when Jared Kushner made those comments about Gaza saying it would be a very, it would be a very [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=518.48s)]
*  valuable land to develop. So this idea of sort of the Riviera for the Middle East, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=525.12s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't dream this up now. Jared Kushner has been planting the seeds for over a year. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=530.64s)]
*  That's right, Stefan. You know, I was really struck by the fact that Trump was reading from prepared [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=537.04s)]
*  remarks. If you notice in that press conference, he was looking down, he was reading out phrases [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=543.84s)]
*  specifically related to this. He then followed up in the questioning. He said an ownership stake. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=551.2s)]
*  So this wasn't something that he made up on the fly in this press conference. It's not clear how [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=558.08s)]
*  widely he socialized this around his own government, never mind with foreign governments. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=563.36s)]
*  So it's not clear that it's an actual formal proposal. And certainly it wouldn't be the first [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=569.44s)]
*  time in Donald Trump's history that he's put something truly outrageous out there because [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=574.48s)]
*  what he really wants to do is to start a conversation or perhaps to distract us from [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=579.6s)]
*  the extraordinary assault on his own government that he and Elon Musk and others are in the middle [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  of carrying out right now. So certainly it has the benefit for him of distracting us. We're having [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=592.4s)]
*  this conversation about a U.S. military takeover of Gaza that seems wildly improbable and very [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=598.32s)]
*  unlikely ever to occur. So I do think we should be calling this, to a certain extent, we should be [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=604.8s)]
*  saying, listen, this is not only an outrageous and brazen proposal, but highly, highly unlikely [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=610.56s)]
*  ever to come to pass and really inconsistent with the kind of steady leadership that you would [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  imagine from any president of the United States. Whether he thought of it this morning or a year [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=627.6s)]
*  ago, it's a pretty remarkably brazen thing to say. Well, good news, Suze. We've got 45 minutes left [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=636.8s)]
*  in this hour and we are not getting distracted. So let's talk about what's happening. Jeff, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=644.48s)]
*  you have reporting today about Trump's latest plan for what he's going to do with the Department of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=648.72s)]
*  Education, i.e. dismantle at least some of it. Tell us. Yeah, more than some of it, Steph. I think [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=653.52s)]
*  his plan, and he talked about it in the Oval Office today when I was there with the White House pool, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=660.48s)]
*  is to shutter the department. He said specifically that he had told Linda McMahon, who is his pick [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=666.72s)]
*  to be Secretary of Education, that he wanted her, once she's confirmed, to basically put herself out [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyv4sQgBLY&t=672.16s)]
