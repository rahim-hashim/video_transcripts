**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I)
*  It's a hard day today. As you know, two suicide bombers, assessed to have been ISIS fighters, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=0.0s)]
*  detonated in the vicinity of the Abbey Gate at Hamad Karzai International Airport and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=6.36s)]
*  in the vicinity of the Barron Hotel, which is immediately adjacent. The attack on the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=10.84s)]
*  Abbey Gate was followed by a number of ISIS gunmen who opened fire on civilians and military [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=14.88s)]
*  forces. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=19.6s)]
*  At this time, we know that 12 U.S. service members have been killed in the attack, and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=20.6s)]
*  15 more service members have been injured. A number of Afghan civilians were also killed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=25.36s)]
*  and injured in the attack. We are treating some of them aboard HKIA. Many other Afghan [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=30.0s)]
*  civilians have been taken out to hospitals in town. We're still working to calculate [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=34.44s)]
*  the total losses. We just don't know what that is right now. Their loss weighs heavily [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  on us all, and I'll talk a little bit more about that as we go through my prepared remarks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=42.8s)]
*  We continue to focus on the protection of our forces and the evacuees as the evacuation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=48.1s)]
*  continues. Let me be clear. While we're saddened by the loss of life, both U.S. and Afghan, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=53.24s)]
*  we're continuing to execute the mission. Our mission is to evacuate U.S. citizens, third [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=59.52s)]
*  country nationals, special immigrant visa holders, U.S. embassy staff, and Afghans at [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=64.04s)]
*  risk. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=68.64s)]
*  Despite this attack, we are continuing the mission, the evacuation at best speed, and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=70.36s)]
*  as of today, we have approximately 5,000 evacuees on the ramp at HKIA awaiting airlift. Since [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=74.88s)]
*  August the 14th, we've evacuated more than 104,000 civilians from HKIA, over 66,000 by [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=80.9s)]
*  the United States and over 37,000 by our allies and partners, and that includes bringing out [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=88.18s)]
*  about 5,000 Americans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=93.7s)]
*  As the Secretary of State said yesterday, we believe that there are about 1,000, probably [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=96.54s)]
*  a little more than 1,000 American citizens left in Afghanistan at this point. We're doing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=101.34s)]
*  everything we can in concert with our Department of State partners to reach out to them and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=105.98s)]
*  to help them leave, if they want to leave. And remember, not everybody wants to leave. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EpWCo_L3I&t=110.78s)]
