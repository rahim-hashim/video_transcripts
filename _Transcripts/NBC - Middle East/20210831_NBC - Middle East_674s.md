# The Taliban Are Hunting Down Our Allies And Killing Them, Says Veteran
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ)
*  More now on how the Afghans and United States citizens who remain in Afghanistan who want [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to leave the country will get out now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=5.3s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Julia Ainsley tackles that in her latest reporting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=11.06s)]
*  Also joining us, Kristen Rouse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=12.5s)]
*  She's a United States Army veteran who served three tours in Afghanistan and is now a board [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=14.1s)]
*  member of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=19.1s)]
*  She's part of a broad network of veterans, government officials, and Afghan-Americans [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  working to save friends, family, and allies from Taliban threats and violence. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=27.360000000000003s)]
*  Good morning to you both. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=32.96s)]
*  Kristen, let me begin with you and thank you for all you've given the country in your three [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=33.96s)]
*  tours in Afghanistan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=37.86s)]
*  Before we talk about the work that you're doing to get your interpreter out and to get [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  other people out of the country, I'm curious what you felt yesterday when the announcement [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=43.06s)]
*  was made that the mission was over in Afghanistan. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=47.660000000000004s)]
*  I knew it was coming, but I felt despair. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=50.96s)]
*  I felt absolute despair because there's people who I've worked with, people who my former [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=57.76s)]
*  soldiers have worked with, who wore our same uniform, who we worked side by side with, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=63.86s)]
*  who we depended on, who we got intel from that protected us, people who enabled us to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=70.86s)]
*  do our jobs overseas, the jobs that we were asked by our government to do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=77.96s)]
*  They served side by side alongside us and they have been explicitly, finally left behind [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=84.16s)]
*  by the United States government. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  And these are our friends. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=94.66s)]
*  These are our colleagues. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=97.36s)]
*  And it feels, I mean, we want the war to end. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=98.86s)]
*  We don't want US troops to be in harm's way, but I feel sick. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=106.16s)]
*  So your team has a list of 175 Afghans, Kristen, that you're working to get out and one particularly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  special and important to you, your own interpreter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=118.46s)]
*  Can you just talk us through your efforts to get your interpreter out of the country? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=120.96s)]
*  Because I think it's instructive for people to hear just how difficult and cumbersome [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  a process and how dangerous a process this is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=129.56s)]
*  That's right, Lily. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=134.16s)]
*  And, you know, we have more than 175 Afghan allies on our list. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=134.96s)]
*  I'm just one of thousands of veterans who have been compiling lists and trying to help [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=139.66s)]
*  friends get out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  From the beginning of the evacuation flights at Kabul Airport, I was working within my [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=147.86s)]
*  networks, within our friends networks, to try to get my interpreter, his wife, and his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=153.66s)]
*  five young children out of the country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=158.86s)]
*  Again, he is as much of a veteran as I am. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=161.36s)]
*  We serve side by side for nine months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  He wore my uniform. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=167.86s)]
*  We've been working for more than 10 years on his visa. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=169.56s)]
*  This is the SIV visas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=173.56s)]
*  Many have successfully gotten SIV visas, but many, many more have not been able to make [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=176.36s)]
*  the bureaucratic hurdles of this visa program. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  And it's not because he didn't serve with absolute integrity and honor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  But we have tried to get him into that airport for 10 days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=192.46s)]
*  I spent sleepless nights where I was, you know, up on a messaging app talking with him [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=197.96s)]
*  directly saying, you know, somebody's going to come for you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=203.66000000000003s)]
*  They'll be right outside. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=206.06s)]
*  They're going to come for you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=207.06s)]
*  You will be in. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=208.86s)]
*  You're on the list. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=209.66000000000003s)]
*  We have this arrangement and then it never happens. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=210.96s)]
*  And the last time that we tried, he messaged me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=213.96s)]
*  He said there's a suicide attack. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=217.86s)]
*  There are bodies everywhere. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=219.36s)]
*  He was outside. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  He was outside one of the areas where there were just, you know, horrific casualties on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=222.16s)]
*  the U.S. and Afghan side from that suicide attack. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=229.46s)]
*  And imagine witnessing that with your two-year-old, with your five-year-old, with your [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=233.16s)]
*  eight-year-old, with your 13-year-old. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  Imagine going through this with your children. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=244.06s)]
*  Imagine them going through scrums of people who are all desperate to get out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=247.26s)]
*  Imagine these are your friends and that, you know, this isn't a matter of, you know, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  sorry, we can't take everyone into the concert. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=259.96s)]
*  This is sorry. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  We are leaving you to be executed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=263.76s)]
*  The Taliban knows your name. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=265.86s)]
*  The Taliban knows who you are. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=267.96s)]
*  They have your ID number. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=269.96s)]
*  They have your name. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=271.36s)]
*  They have your biometric information. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=272.26s)]
*  All it takes is catching you at one of the checkpoints that are absolutely everywhere. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  All it takes is one of their door-to-door searches that they are actively doing to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=278.56s)]
*  hunt down people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=281.96s)]
*  All it takes is them finding you and killing you and your wife and your children. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=283.76s)]
*  That is what we're that's what we are saying when we say we can't take everyone with us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=289.76s)]
*  We have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of our allies who worked alongside [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=294.06s)]
*  us who we have left for execution. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=298.86s)]
*  And many of us we are not giving up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=301.76s)]
*  We are still trying to find ways out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=304.96s)]
*  We need the government. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=307.26s)]
*  We need our government to at least make arrangements with neighboring countries. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=308.46s)]
*  If we have wonderful relations with Pakistan, make an agreement so that they can get across [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=311.76s)]
*  the border. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  If we have wonderful relations with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, make arrangements so that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  people can flee over the border because the borders are locked and people cannot get through. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=322.96s)]
*  And the price isn't you can't get into the concert. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=328.66s)]
*  The price is you will die. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=332.06s)]
*  So Kristen, what is the hope now for your interpreter and for all those other people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=335.06s)]
*  that need to get out of that country because of the risk that you laid out in such stark [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=339.36s)]
*  terms there to their lives literally to their lives if they're found American troops are [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=344.16s)]
*  gone. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=348.76000000000005s)]
*  They can't go to the airport that's controlled by the Taliban and the airport is not even [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=349.06s)]
*  functioning anymore. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=352.56s)]
*  What remains for them? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=354.16s)]
*  What can you say here this morning to the American government? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=355.46s)]
*  What needs to get done here? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  My interpreter messaged me last night and he said we they have killed us mentally. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=363.06s)]
*  They've been killed with bureaucracy over decades not being able to get visas. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=369.06s)]
*  Even US citizens are not able to get their families out or expedite visas. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's it's this is this is such a broad range of people who cannot get out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=379.76s)]
*  It is it is locked down through State Department processes where State Department is saying [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=384.56s)]
*  like sorry, we can't we can't do anything about your visa as if people are sitting [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=390.06s)]
*  comfortably at home, you know, just chilling while a new you know, while a brutal new [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=393.86s)]
*  regime takes over like these are people run it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=399.16s)]
*  They are changing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=401.36s)]
*  You're changing houses like every few hours to get away from people who are saying we [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=402.16s)]
*  know where you are and we're going to kill you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=406.86s)]
*  They are fleeing and State Department officials even even as early as recently as Sunday [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=408.86s)]
*  are sending out emails saying sorry, we can't do anything. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  I know this isn't the response you want. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=418.06s)]
*  Good luck and and the endless the endless bureaucracy like imagine being trapped at [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=420.46s)]
*  the DMV because you didn't have the one thing that with the one date that matches the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  other thing and I mean like it's outrageous that the hoops that they are the paperwork [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=431.56s)]
*  that they are demanding of people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=436.76s)]
*  I'm still doing paperwork for for some of these Afghans doing paperwork while they are [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=437.86s)]
*  running for their lives. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=442.76s)]
*  So it just raises the question we've heard yesterday again from General McKenzie that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=445.76s)]
*  yes, the military presence is gone. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=451.86s)]
*  We heard from Secretary Blinken as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=454.16s)]
*  Yes, the military presence is gone, but we turn to diplomatic efforts and we retain the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  ability to help Americans and some of these Afghan Afghan wartime partners that you're [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  talking about here to get them out of the country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=465.86s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=468.36s)]
*  How are they going to get them out of the country? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  I hope they come up with something there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=473.26s)]
*  There are airfields across Afghanistan that flights can be brought to if they can make [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=475.76s)]
*  agreements with Taliban to to enter the airspace and and keep evacuating people then then [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB0gxrdltIQ&t=480.36s)]
