# What comes next in the conflict between Israel and Hamas after death of Sinwar?
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o)
*  What are the key questions? I mean, is there anything, even approaching an easy answer, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=0.0s)]
*  to it's time to stop or the risk is greater if we don't stop? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=6.24s)]
*  So I think the first thing, Chris, that we need to put in our minds is what Israel felt like in the hours and days after October 7. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=15.0s)]
*  It was a shock unlike anything Israel had experienced. Israel, the military superpower of the Middle East, had been caught absolutely by surprise. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=27.0s)]
*  When I visited in the weeks after that attack, I felt, yes, a sense of shock from Israelis, but also shame that this could have happened. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=37.0s)]
*  Netanyahu, who at that time was really an outcast, who in the polls was very unpopular with Israelis, has come back as a wartime leader. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=46.0s)]
*  So in a sense he's riding that crest and I think we'll hear that tone in his voice when he speaks later today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=58.0s)]
*  Again, the question is whether he can think carefully about strategic ends. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=65.0s)]
*  Israel is better at starting wars historically than it is at ending them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=72.0s)]
*  And I think that's something Netanyahu should think very carefully about. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=76.0s)]
*  You know, the famous question that Dave Petraeus asked on the way to Baghdad in 2003, tell me how this ends. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=80.0s)]
*  So that's the question today that Netanyahu should be thinking about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=87.0s)]
*  Tell me how this ends. Is this a moment when I begin to move toward the ending? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=92.0s)]
*  Richard Engel is someone who has been on the ground in that region, well, for decades. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=97.0s)]
*  But particularly in the last year plus days since the October 7th attack. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=101.0s)]
*  Address that, if you will, about the strategic considerations about whether to continue or to stop. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=106.0s)]
*  Well, I agree with David that there is a question whether Prime Minister Netanyahu can take the win to use another colloquial expression. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=115.0s)]
*  He has had success after success recently after the obviously intelligence failure of October 7th, killing Nasrallah, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=125.0s)]
*  the way the missile defense systems in Israel with American support worked not only once but worked twice to fend off an Iranian attack, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=132.0s)]
*  now killing Sinwar, all of this relatively one after the other. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=143.0s)]
*  But where does all this go? Prime Minister Netanyahu has never laid out a plan of what comes next in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=150.0s)]
*  So this could very well be the death of Hamas as we've known it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=157.0s)]
*  But what comes after that? To use the Osama bin Laden analogy, Osama bin Laden was killed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=162.0s)]
*  He was a key leader. He was the architect of 9-11. His death did set back Al-Qaeda tremendously. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=168.0s)]
*  But in this vacuum, ISIS came up and ISIS was brutal. ISIS was, I don't want to say worse than 9-11, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=177.0s)]
*  but it was very different and it was equally aggressive and carried out many attacks, a lot of them in Europe, including the Baraklan attack. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=184.0s)]
*  So will this blow to Hamas, to Yehya Sinwar, to the Hamas leadership be the death of Hamas? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=192.0s)]
*  Or will it be the rebirth of something else that is potentially just as radical or even more radical? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=202.0s)]
*  Because how do things improve? What is the off-ramp for Gaza? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=207.0s)]
*  The Gaza Strip has been devastated. More than 40,000 people killed there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=212.0s)]
*  Two-thirds of the buildings, I believe is the latest estimate, have either been damaged or destroyed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=217.0s)]
*  A tremendous amount of misery and suffering and a sense of hopelessness. And hopelessness always breeds extremism. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=224.0s)]
*  So this could be very important tactically, very important psychologically for the Israeli people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=231.0s)]
*  It could have direct consequences, perhaps very devastating consequences for the hostages. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=237.0s)]
*  We don't know. We'll have to see on that. But will this be the end of militancy in Gaza? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=242.0s)]
*  I don't believe so by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=249.0s)]
*  And we still don't know whether this will be an off-ramp for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=253.0s)]
*  I think there needs to be more encouragement that he is winning and that he needs to keep winning [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=259.0s)]
*  and keeps to push his position, particularly when it comes to Iran. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=263.0s)]
*  Because that is still pending, Israel's military response against Iran for the last missile barrage. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=270.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-xBU_YD90o&t=289.0s)]
