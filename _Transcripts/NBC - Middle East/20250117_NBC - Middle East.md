# ‘A profound difference’: USAID Admin. Samantha Power on getting aid into Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM)
*  Joining me now, USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who is the former UN Ambassador from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=0.0s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=6.72s)]
*  Thank you so much for everything you've done. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=8.44s)]
*  There's been a lot of news today with everything changing on Capitol Hill, but let's quickly [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  get to the humanitarian aid for the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=15.64s)]
*  If and when this goes into effect, do you think that some of the barriers that, frankly, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=19.3s)]
*  that Israel has put up along the borders and the closures can be eliminated? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=23.84s)]
*  So we can get more truckloads in and move it quickly? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=28.16s)]
*  Thank you, Andrea, and thanks for all the attention you have paid to the humanitarian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=34.24s)]
*  situation in Gaza from the beginning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=38.8s)]
*  The short answer is, yes, we really hope to be able to surge humanitarian assistance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=41.44s)]
*  We have sent a team from Washington to the region. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=46.28s)]
*  They're working through the modalities of how many more checkpoints can be open at one [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=50.72s)]
*  the time, how the hours can be extended, where the trucks can be sourced from. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=55.4s)]
*  We have had stockpiles in the region for a long time that we have been trying to push [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=60.36s)]
*  in. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=64.72s)]
*  The end of conflict is going to make a profound difference, I mean, just in terms of the ability [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=65.72s)]
*  to move from north to south in Gaza, which has been severely impeded, the ability to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=69.52s)]
*  reach people in northern Gaza who are surely the worse off of any of the hungry civilians. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=73.56s)]
*  Obviously, shelter is still a huge issue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=81.52s)]
*  Getting winterization supplies in, only 20 or 30 percent of the things that we thought [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=83.64s)]
*  were needed for winter have reached civilians who are mainly living kind of out away from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=88.28s)]
*  homes given all of the destruction that has occurred. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  So we've got to take advantage of this, and I think we're well positioned to do so, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=97.08s)]
*  but we also need more resources to be mobilized. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  If we can bring up the number of trucks that are going in, we're going to want there to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  be a consistent, steady pipeline, and the next administration, of course, has been absolutely [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=108.56s)]
*  pivotal in helping secure the ceasefire, and we're hoping in the implementation and in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  the humanitarian emergency assistance, but also in the reconstruction phase that will [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=119.08s)]
*  come later, that they will also be deeply engaged. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  And you've traveled all over the world endlessly and dealing with all of these disasters, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  I just want to leave this on a positive note. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=131.56s)]
*  You've also managed to make sport diplomacy part of your regimen in 50 countries playing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=135.36s)]
*  rugby, baseball, trying to bridge divides. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  How important is that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it just comes down to meeting people where they are. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  I think USAID is America's ground game in our foreign policy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=151.12s)]
*  We show that our model is different from that of the PRC. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  We give grants, not loans. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=158.8s)]
*  We're out there in communities actually listening to young people to find out what their aspirations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  are to tailor our programming in digital, in education, in agriculture, you name it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  And so getting out there and meeting young people on their terms, there's nothing quite [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=171.64s)]
*  like the equalizer of getting schooled by a 12-year-old in soccer or in cricket or by [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=176.68s)]
*  a 17-year-old in basketball. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  And so that kind of opens up a space for a different kind of engagement and to show America [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=187.44s)]
*  and that what we do is on behalf of the American people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pOWjdXkM&t=191.4s)]
