# ‘We can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon’: Rep. Schneider weighs in on conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4)
*  Brad Schneider, Democratic Congressman from Illinois, member of the House Foreign Affairs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=4.66s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=5.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=6.66s)]
*  Congressman, what can you tell us about the conversations you had? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=7.66s)]
*  Who did you meet with and what did they tell you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, it was a bipartisan delegation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  We flew to Saudi Arabia, met with leaders, the Vice Foreign Minister in Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=16.78s)]
*  then flew to Bahrain, met with members of their government, including, as you can see [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=23.2s)]
*  on camera, the Crown Prince, several other people in their government, and finally to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=27.68s)]
*  the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=32.64s)]
*  What we heard in all of those locations was the clear appreciation that Iran with nuclear [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=34.4s)]
*  weapon was an existential threat to every single country in the Gulf region, as well [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=40.56s)]
*  as to Israel and to the world as a whole, and that we cannot allow, under any circumstances, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=45.8s)]
*  Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=50.44s)]
*  At the same time, they were all hoping to see de-escalation, to see the violence currently [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=52.8s)]
*  between Israel and Iran calm down, as Keir Starmer mentioned, in the lead-in, cooler [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=58.54s)]
*  heads, but we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  So this war could end immediately if Iran would agree to come into compliance with the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=67.84s)]
*  IAEA, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and also then go in and allow inspectors in, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  get rid of their highly enriched uranium, take the steps necessary to assure the world [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=81.12s)]
*  that they are not trying to develop a nuclear weapon, which enriching to 60% uranium and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=85.48s)]
*  rushing to 90% is the exact opposite indication of what the world was looking for. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=91.28s)]
*  So that leads me perfectly into where President Trump is right now, which is he has a monumental [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  and consequential decision to make about what involvement the U.S. might have if diplomacy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  fails. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=107.68s)]
*  Where do you think we are in this process, and what did those Middle East allies tell [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=108.9s)]
*  you about their concerns? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, the first concern on any action is that there is no certainty where a war ends. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=115.06s)]
*  You know the moment it begins, but you don't know the outcomes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=122.42s)]
*  The law of unintended consequences preside here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=125.06s)]
*  And so we want to get that the longer this conflict goes, the longer Iran refuses to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  abandon its nuclear program, the more concerned there is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=132.52s)]
*  It is true the president has a very consequential decision. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=136.14s)]
*  It's not just his decision. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=139.26s)]
*  In fact, Congress in the Constitution has the responsibility to decide when the United [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  States does go to war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=145.77999999999997s)]
*  So I believe the president needs to come to Congress and we need to understand what is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=147.98s)]
*  known, what is known about Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=152.94s)]
*  We have known for a while they were on the precipice of having sufficient enriched uranium [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=155.77999999999997s)]
*  to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=160.26s)]
*  The understanding was that the Ayatollah had not given that command. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=163.18s)]
*  The assessment by many, including Israel, is that Iran had made the decision within [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=166.82s)]
*  the last few days, last few weeks, to rush to break out, to have enough fuel for a weapon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=173.58s)]
*  I saw that Eric Karali, the head of central command, estimated that they would have enough [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=179.62s)]
*  fuel for a weapon and be able to build one in three days and have enough enriched uranium [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=184.94s)]
*  to build 10 or more within a few weeks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=189.74s)]
*  That's just not acceptable, not acceptable to any of our allies in the region and not [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=192.94s)]
*  acceptable to the United States or anyone who worries about Iran with a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  Which leads us to the question of what can be done about it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=202.22s)]
*  Israel's defense minister is calling Iran's supreme leader a modern day Hitler, saying, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=204.9s)]
*  quote, he can't continue to exist. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=209.62s)]
*  And that's one of many statements we're hearing from Israeli leaders suggesting that their [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=212.78s)]
*  goals go beyond dismantling the nuclear program. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=216.34s)]
*  In fact, we have the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=219.66000000000003s)]
*  on yesterday. He was openly encouraging the Iranian people to seize the moment, rise up [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=222.86s)]
*  against their leaders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  What would that mean for the world if they did? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=228.86s)]
*  You know, I can't speak for the foreign minister. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  I did speak with the foreign minister yesterday with my colleagues in United Arab Emirates. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=234.5s)]
*  We were able to have a conference call. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  But here's what I can tell you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=243.78s)]
*  In 1979, when the current regime took over Iran within a violent revolution, they declared [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=245.7s)]
*  the United States to be their enemy, Israel to be their enemy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=254.38s)]
*  They have waged a low scale war ever since. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=257.42s)]
*  Number one supporter of state terrorism, including the attacks on the Marine barracks in Lebanon [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=261.62s)]
*  and cobar towers in Saudi Arabia, attacked on the Jewish community in Argentina, as well [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=267.82s)]
*  as attacks in Europe and around the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=273.86s)]
*  Iran, this regime in Iran is an enemy of the United States, self declared. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=276.34s)]
*  They declared their enemy to the United States with chance of death to America, death to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=282.06s)]
*  Israel. We know what they want and we know where they stand. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=286.14s)]
*  And that's why allowing Iran to have nuclear enrichment is extremely concerning. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=289.5s)]
*  And we can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=295.42s)]
*  And so the words we choose, we should be measured in the words we choose. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=298.3s)]
*  I would perhaps select different words. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=302.62s)]
*  But the need for Iran to be prevented from having that weapon and the prospect for the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=306.18s)]
*  people of Iran to be able to shake off the tyranny of this regime. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  They tried it in 2009, again in 2019 and again in the last couple of years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  The people are suffering under the Ayatollah and the people around the Ayatollah, the IRGC, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=323.3s)]
*  etc. And my hope is that those people will be able to take their future into their own hands. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=329.14s)]
*  Congressman Brad Schneider, thank you so much for being on the program. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDpJM2pYG4&t=337.34s)]
