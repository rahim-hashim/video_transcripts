# Richard Engel: 'Things already looking quite difficult' in Israel, Hamas deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78)
*  All big news. And Willie, what an eventful day of news. Of course, we had hearings yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=0.0s)]
*  Some look like they're going to sell through pretty easily. Others were contentious at times. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=6.96s)]
*  We'll be getting to that. Los Angeles looks like there may be hope in the coming days that they're [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=11.6s)]
*  going to be able to contain some of these horrific fires. Joe Biden's address last night is sort of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=17.44s)]
*  echoing Eisenhower's prescient threat of a military industrial complex, which has proven to be the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=25.12s)]
*  case over the past 70 years, where you have Congress pushing for weapon systems that the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=33.52s)]
*  Pentagon doesn't even want. But the big story, the possibility of this peace fire deal, and yes, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=40.08s)]
*  there's going to be squabbling back and forth by both camps. But David Sanger reporting today, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=49.76s)]
*  Peter Baker reporting today, what happened in negotiations? Nothing short of historic and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=57.04s)]
*  incoming and outgoing administration having their aides coordinate in the closest of ways [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=65.2s)]
*  the end of just a bloody brutal war. Yeah, even in the busy news day you laid out above the fold [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  and all of the newspapers this morning is this news of a ceasefire deal that you have here in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and all the other papers. And yeah, despite what we [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=85.44s)]
*  just saw a moment ago from President Biden saying, are you serious? Who should get credit for this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  deal? It turns out, and we'll talk to Peter Baker about his reporting on this in the Times this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=94.0s)]
*  morning, it turns out there was behind the scenes collaboration between the incoming [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=98.0s)]
*  administration and the outgoing one to get this deal, which looks a little tenuous this morning, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=102.64s)]
*  but there are high hopes that at least some of these hostages will go home and that aid will [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=108.08s)]
*  start to flow into Gaza. Yeah, the hostage situation would be the end of agony, at least [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=112.8s)]
*  for some families. Israel's claiming Hamas has reneged, though, on a ceasefire deal that would [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=119.6s)]
*  end 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip and free dozens of hostages in an effort to gain [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=125.28s)]
*  concessions. According to the Israeli Prime Minister's office, the Israeli cabinet will [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=131.28s)]
*  not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=136.8s)]
*  agreement. The Prime Minister's office did not elaborate. A senior Hamas official says that Hamas [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=144.0s)]
*  is committed to the ceasefire agreement. And David Ignatius, let's talk about that for just [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=149.28s)]
*  half a second. And we're going to outline the contours of the deal, but just for people waking [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=154.88s)]
*  up this morning hearing this news, the truth is that Benjamin Netanyahu is taking it from [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  the most right wing, most orthodox elements of his coalition. So I must say when I was reading [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=166.4s)]
*  that last night, I expected some sort of pushback from Netanyahu sort of to try to flex so his [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  government didn't collapse because the hardliners on the far far right were talking about trying [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=182.08s)]
*  to undermine his government. Maybe that's his way of doing it this morning. What can you tell us? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  So, Joe, after so many months of fighting, so much suffering for both Israel and the Palestinians, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  you can't help but rejoice in this news that there's finally going to be a ceasefire, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=204.0s)]
*  42 days, not a permanent ceasefire yet, and the release of the hostages who've been held so cruelly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=208.24s)]
*  They'll begin to come out if all holds on Sunday, begin to reunite with their families, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  including some Americans. Officials say two Americans are likely to be released in this first [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  group. What's held this up for so many months are the details of precisely who the Hamas fighters [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=226.96s)]
*  are holding and where they're held, and I think more important, who Israel will release among [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=236.8s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Officials say there will be hundreds of Palestinians [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  coming out as the hostages are released. How many of those will be people carrying life sentences [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=249.84s)]
*  for having murdered Israelis? That's the kind of thing that Israelis may be studying at the last [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=256.32s)]
*  minute. They've gone over literally every name on this list as they've come down to the final [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=261.92s)]
*  negotiations. I think the thing that worries me, Joe, most about this deal is that there still is [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=266.48s)]
*  not in Israel a clear sense of what the day after the end of this war will look like. That's something [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=272.72s)]
*  the U.S. has been pressing for for many months, and to me the details still aren't clear, which [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=279.6s)]
*  means that Gaza is going to be a lawless place, a messy, ungoverned place for a long while to come. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=284.4s)]
*  So let's talk about some of those details. If this deal does hold, it would have several phases. Phase [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=292.56s)]
*  one would begin on Sunday and last for 42 days. During that time, 33 hostages would be freed by [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  Hamas. Two of those are expected to be Americans. In return, Israel would release 100 Palestinian [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  prisoners serving life sentences and 1,000 other prisoners not involved in the October 7th attacks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=310.4s)]
*  It also would provide a large amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza, 600 trucks a day, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=317.28s)]
*  and allow for hospitals and health care centers in the enclave to be rebuilt. Future phases aim to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=322.56s)]
*  bring a permanent end to the war, with remaining hostages and soldiers exchange, Israeli forces [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=328.32s)]
*  withdrawing, and reconstruction in Gaza beginning. Let's bring in NBC News chief foreign correspondent [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=333.2s)]
*  Richard Engel live from Jerusalem. Richard, what more can you tell us about this, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=340.24s)]
*  how it came together, and how long it may hold? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=345.2s)]
*  Well, things are already looking quite difficult. So today, this morning, there was supposed to be [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=351.44s)]
*  a meeting held by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his security cabinet, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=358.0s)]
*  and they were supposed to formally ratify the deal. That meeting has been postponed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=364.64s)]
*  Some Israeli media are saying it's going to be held tonight, although that's not entirely confirmed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=370.72s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister's office hasn't given an explicit reason why the meeting has been [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=377.6s)]
*  postponed, just accusing Hamas of trying to renege on the deal. But as David Ignatius was saying just [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=383.6s)]
*  a short while ago, it does seem to be focused on the issue of Palestinian prisoners, which [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=390.96s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners could be released, who has the ultimate veto power of releasing Palestinian [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=396.88s)]
*  prisoners. Hamas has a list of names. Israel is objecting to some of those names. So until this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  is signed, it's not going forward. But the good news is it doesn't seem to be off. No one has [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  said that the deal isn't happening. No one is saying that the deal has been called off. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=418.08s)]
*  It just isn't being ratified yet until they can work out these last-minute details. And it is not [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=423.28s)]
*  supposed to go into effect until Sunday, so there still is a little bit of time. There's also ongoing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=430.0s)]
*  military operations. There were heavy strikes by Israel into Gaza overnight, and according to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  local medical officials, 71 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza just since this deal was [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=444.16s)]
*  announced yesterday. And according to those Palestinian medical officials, the majority of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=452.48s)]
*  them were women and children. So just a few hours after the deal, the deal was announced during the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=456.88000000000005s)]
*  period of darkness here or last night, local time. It is now sort of mid-morning, late morning here [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  in Israel. There's already quite a high death toll. The Israelis haven't signed it. Hamas says [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=470.32s)]
*  that they never tried to change the terms of the deal. They're asking for the Americans to intervene [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=477.52s)]
*  and resolve this problem. They're accusing Prime Minister Netanyahu of looking for an excuse [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=484.0s)]
*  so that he doesn't have to go forward with this deal so that he can placate members of his [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=490.32s)]
*  right-wing coalition. There are problems already a few hours after the deal, but so far the problems [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=496.72s)]
*  seem to be on a, I don't want to call, manageable scale, but no one has called it off. No one has [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=505.12s)]
*  walked away. No one has said the deal is dead, and we still have until Sunday. All right, NBC's Richard [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  Engel, as always, thank you so much for your reporting. We greatly appreciate it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=518.08s)]
*  you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dnBbvF_q78&t=526.72s)]
