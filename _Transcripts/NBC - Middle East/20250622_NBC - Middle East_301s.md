# ‘This is a violation of the law’: Top House Armed Services Dem. reacts to U.S. strikes on Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU)
*  Joining me, we have Washington Congressman Adam Smith. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=3.5s)]
*  Congressman, why wouldn't the president have come to Congress before launching these strikes? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=6.8s)]
*  Well, there's multiple layers here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think the most important thing is what your previous panel discussed, that we've [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  now just stepped into a war with Iran. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=17.0s)]
*  The president seems to think that he can do this and Iran just won't respond. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=20.7s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=25.44s)]
*  We are now in a conflict with Iran, with all the unpredictability and danger that comes with that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=26.9s)]
*  We don't even know for sure exactly what was destroyed in those strikes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=32.9s)]
*  So the policy going forward is really important. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=36.9s)]
*  As for the notification process, it's incredibly disturbing that the president would take a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=39.7s)]
*  partisan approach to this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=43.9s)]
*  That is unprecedented. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  Now, presidents have at various times weaseled their way around the Constitution and the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=47.5s)]
*  wars, whereas sorry, the War Powers Resolution in a bunch of different ways. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=52.9s)]
*  But clearly, the Constitution and the law says the Trump should have notified Congress before [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=58.1s)]
*  doing this. He did not have authorization for this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=61.9s)]
*  There's no credible argument for self-defense. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=64.3s)]
*  There's no authorization for the use of military force. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=66.5s)]
*  This is a violation of the law. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=69.7s)]
*  It's not unprecedented. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=72.1s)]
*  What is unprecedented is for the partisan approach that the president took on this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=73.7s)]
*  And I should say that you did advise earlier this week against striking Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=79.3s)]
*  Are you aware of any new intelligence that may have pushed the White House into action right now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=82.6s)]
*  No, I don't think there's any new intelligence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=89.6s)]
*  I think the president received an enormous amount of pressure from Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=91.6s)]
*  and Israel. And also, I think the president felt that Israel was winning and he wanted to get in on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=96.1s)]
*  that and he wanted to be part of this successful strategy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=102.6s)]
*  You remember when this started, President Trump, by all reports, had asked Israel not to launch [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  the attack that they launched on Iran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=111.1s)]
*  He didn't want to go there, and then he wound up there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=113.5s)]
*  It sounds to me like he got sort of dragged into this by what happens a lot of times. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=115.6s)]
*  Yes, we have civilian control of the military, but the military will come and tell the civilian control, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=121.5s)]
*  if we just did this, we can win. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  This will work. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=129.1s)]
*  There won't be any problems. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=129.9s)]
*  And we've gotten in a lot of trouble taking that advice in a whole number of different places. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  And I'm pretty confident the president just got us in a lot of trouble in Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=136.0s)]
*  So to that extent, what are your concerns, let's say, about threats to U.S. personnel and interests in the region? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=141.1s)]
*  I think those threats are coming. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Iran is going to respond. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=148.7s)]
*  We have bases throughout Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Iraq, Syria. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=151.6s)]
*  We have some force protection methods. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=157.5s)]
*  They're not foolproof. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  Iran will attack. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=161.6s)]
*  And then the question is, then what do we do? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=162.7s)]
*  How do we respond to that attack? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=165.5s)]
*  The president said we would respond forcefully. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  And there's your escalation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=169.2s)]
*  And for all the success that Israel has had, if you look at the map of Iran, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=170.9s)]
*  there's a massive part of Iran in the south that Israel has not touched, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  where there are a lot of missiles and drones capable of attacking those U.S. targets. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=180.1s)]
*  There's no effort to degrade that capability right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  So Iran is still a capable power. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=188.8s)]
*  And we don't know. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  And it's just so troubling to have the president come out and say, we obliterated their nuclear program. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  All good. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  We're done. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=197.8s)]
*  That is not what happened. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=198.9s)]
*  All right. We don't know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=200.8s)]
*  We don't know how much of it destroyed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=202.0s)]
*  But it's reasonable to assume, as one of your previous guests said in the last week or two, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  Iran has been moving stuff around. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, they certainly saw what was coming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=209.8s)]
*  So I guess we can hope at this point that this forces Iran to the negotiating table. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=212.5s)]
*  But that seems highly unlikely. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=218.5s)]
*  An escalating conflict in the region is the much more likely outcome. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  What is the line across which that it's inevitable and we're in? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=225.8s)]
*  No. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=232.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, sorry, we've already crossed that line in terms of there being a conflict. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=234.3s)]
*  I mean, there's a line in the way you just described it where no war, war, except for the fact that we just bombed them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=238.8s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=245.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=246.0s)]
*  You know, like I said, I think it's highly unlikely that Iran is just going to let this go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=246.8s)]
*  And that seems to be the president's plan that we will hit them this hard and they'll cave. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's an enormous risk given what escalation could mean. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=258.8s)]
*  So I guess to answer your question, we crossed that line. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  We bombed Iran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=267.7s)]
*  We are in a conflict with Iran now until we come to some sort of negotiated settlement. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=269.3s)]
*  And I don't think anyone could predict when that would be. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=274.5s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith, I appreciate very much you weighing in on all this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=278.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlL2cKzS6UU&t=282.8s)]
