# John Kirby: What Iran did was truly unprecedented
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c)
*  Joining us now, White House National Security Communications Advisor and Assistant to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=0.0s)]
*  President, retired Rear Admiral John Kirby. Thank you so much for coming on this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=4.24s)]
*  So much happened over the weekend. I'm curious if you can assess for us what the options are on the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=9.28s)]
*  table for Israel. And I know that you've already said that it's up to Israel to make a decision [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=17.12s)]
*  as to what their response will be. How much influence, though, will the United States have [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=23.84s)]
*  on that being as much diplomacy as possible, given how much upheaval the region is already [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=29.28s)]
*  enduring? Well, as you know, Mika, the president convened the G7 leaders yesterday to talk about a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  unified, strong diplomatic response. And those leaders talked about other ways we can work [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=47.2s)]
*  together to try to hold Iran accountable. So we're exploring some of those options as we speak. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=54.96s)]
*  We'll see where that discussion goes. But what Iran did was truly unprecedented. And the world [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=61.04s)]
*  needs to speak with one voice, that that's unacceptable and that they should be held to account [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=67.6s)]
*  for a scale of attack that we just haven't seen before coming from Iranian soil. Now, again, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=72.48s)]
*  as you said, what the Israelis will do, they will do, and they will talk about that. And I certainly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=78.16s)]
*  want to reserve them that space. The president was clear with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Saturday [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=84.16s)]
*  night that this was an extraordinary military success. It showed not only Israel's military [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=88.72s)]
*  superiority, but that Israel is not alone, that the United States actually—he actually put—the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=95.44s)]
*  president put American fighter jets in the air, actively defending Israel in harm's way. That [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=100.56s)]
*  goes a long way, and that sends a strong message about where Israel is in the region versus where [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=107.52s)]
*  Iran is in the region, which is increasingly isolated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=112.8s)]
*  Incredible precision and prevention led by the U.S. to intercept this attack. And I wonder what [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=116.64s)]
*  that collective, quick, fast, precise action says to Iran and about Iran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  I think it says to Iran that when the president says we are committed to the self-defense of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=135.28s)]
*  Israel, he means it. This wasn't just about giving Israel weapons. We actually had American [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=140.08s)]
*  fighter pilots in the air. We had American ships at sea knocking things down. We were very much [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=145.36s)]
*  actively engaged. And the thing I think it says about Iran is that they don't have that military [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  superiority. I mean, what they tried to do, they utterly failed. And again, I want to go back to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=155.68s)]
*  what I said before. It also shows that Israel is not alone. They do have friends. Nobody's walking [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=160.56s)]
*  away from them and their ability to defend themselves. But again, the president also has [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=165.52s)]
*  made it clear he doesn't want to see a war with Iran. We don't want to see this conflict widen and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=169.28s)]
*  deepen and broaden throughout the region. We want to see things de-escalate. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=173.84s)]
*  Can I switch the conversation a little bit back to Gaza and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=178.48s)]
*  Ra'far and your relationship with Israelis on that front? Because when we're talking about friends, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=182.64s)]
*  after the shooting of the World Central Kitchen aid workers, America basically said to Israel, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=188.0s)]
*  if you don't allow more aid in, we will reconsider our policies towards Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=196.72s)]
*  Are you satisfied with the amount of aid? The aid has stepped up. Do you think it's enough? Are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=202.0s)]
*  you satisfied? Is that threat of reconsidering your policy towards Israel now off the table? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=206.32s)]
*  Thanks, Katie. Yeah, the aid has increased and quite dramatically in just the last few days. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=213.04s)]
*  More than 2000 trucks have been able to get in. I think I might be wrong on this number, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=219.52s)]
*  but I think it's nearly 100 or so over the last 24 hours alone. So the aid is getting in. That's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=224.32s)]
*  important, but it has to be sustained. And what we also said was our policy with respect to Gaza [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  will have to change if we don't see changes over time and have them sustained. So far, yes, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=236.48s)]
*  they have been meeting the commitments they made to President Biden. They have been doing the things [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=242.0s)]
*  that the president asked them to do, but we really need to see it sustained over time. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire, can we get audio? All right, I'm going to take Jonathan Lemire's audio. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=249.44s)]
*  I guess that microphone doesn't work. Admiral, just moving forward, what will the White House [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=260.64s)]
*  be looking for and working toward in the next few days given the dramatic attack that was [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=265.76s)]
*  intercepted over the weekend? It appears all is calm in Israel given that schools are opening, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=271.36s)]
*  but Israel has said they will respond when they feel like it, when they feel they are ready, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=277.2s)]
*  and that there will be a response. What's the message that the administration is sending to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=282.64s)]
*  Israel as they consider what to do next? I think really that came out of the discussion [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  with the president and the prime minister on Saturday night. Again, it was commending [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  an incredible military achievement, which again showed that Israel has friends and showed that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=298.32s)]
*  Israel is militarily superior to Iran. Iran did not show itself well on Saturday night given what [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=304.48s)]
*  they tried to do versus what got in. I think the president's message to Prime Minister Netanyahu was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=311.68s)]
*  this is an extraordinary military success. This is a huge diplomatic success. It's quite an [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  achievement. You ought to think about what that success sends as a message to Iran and to the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=324.16s)]
*  region and consider how important the impact of what you proved you could do on Saturday night [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=329.28s)]
*  really is. The president doesn't want to see this thing widen, doesn't want to see a war with Iran, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=336.08s)]
*  and again that's been a consistent message from him. Yep, White House National Security [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=340.55999999999995s)]
*  Communications Advisor and Assistant to the President, retired Rear Admiral John Kirby, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwKC5dxC9c&t=345.11999999999995s)]
