# Displaced families crowd Beirut streets as fears of Israeli invasion grow
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI)
*  Israel has been ignoring U.S., European, and Arab leaders all calling for a temporary ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=0.0s)]
*  and continuing its strikes against Lebanon, hitting Beirut for the first time and preparing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=6.74s)]
*  troops to go in on the ground and by sea. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=11.64s)]
*  U.S. officials have told NBC News they had no warning from Israel of the massive strike [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=14.74s)]
*  that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also the mastermind behind attacks [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  against hundreds of Americans, starting with the 1983 bombing of the Marine Barracks in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=25.22s)]
*  Beirut. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Blinken addressing his death this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=31.34s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah was a brutal terrorist whose many victims included Americans, Lebanon, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=35.3s)]
*  the region, the world, are safer without him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=43.14s)]
*  Iran is vowing revenge for Nasrallah's death, which Israel equates with the U.S. killing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  of Osama bin Laden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=53.34s)]
*  The Friday attack that killed Nasrallah set off a weekend of Israeli strikes inside Lebanon, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=55.08s)]
*  taking out other senior commanders from Hezbollah and raising the prospects of a ground invasion. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  An Israeli official tells NBC News the IDF has been carrying out commando raids inside [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=66.02s)]
*  Lebanon for months. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=70.98s)]
*  Israel's expanding war also stretching into Yemen, with a major strike Sunday targeting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=73.1s)]
*  another Iranian militia group there, the Houthis. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=77.94s)]
*  We call this as Prime Minister Netanyahu, not President Biden, is setting the region's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=81.44s)]
*  agenda with a series of recent Israeli actions blind-sighting Washington. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  We begin in Lebanon with NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel and former CIA [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=90.32s)]
*  officer, NBC News national security and intelligence analyst Mark Palamiropoulos. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=95.36s)]
*  Richard first to you as night falls, Hezbollah says it is ready for a ground invasion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  Does it feel increasingly imminent? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=107.3s)]
*  And their command and control has been decimated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=109.22s)]
*  So who's leading the organization now? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=113.34s)]
*  So, let me first tell you a little bit about the mood here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  And yes, a ground incursion, a ground invasion does feel increasingly imminent, especially [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=122.38s)]
*  after the Israeli defense minister just said a short while ago that an incursion into Lebanon [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=128.46s)]
*  could come very soon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=134.54s)]
*  I am now in Martyr Square, which is the dead center of Beirut. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=136.7s)]
*  And if you look around, this is now becoming increasingly full of internally displaced people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=141.62s)]
*  People are sleeping out here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=147.9s)]
*  They are living rough. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=149.8s)]
*  They are sleeping on the streets. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=150.84s)]
*  If you pan around, they're just staying on the center dividers here on what is effectively [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=152.42s)]
*  a highway right through the middle of the city. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=158.86s)]
*  And most of the people here are from either southern Lebanon, areas that are currently [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=161.5s)]
*  under attack by Israel, an area that would likely see the ground invasion if that ground [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=166.62s)]
*  invasion does happen and does happen immediately, or they are from the southern suburbs of Beirut, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=172.86s)]
*  that area where Hassan Nasrallah was killed by the series of Israeli airstrikes, those [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=178.86s)]
*  massive bunker buster bombs that decimated the underground complex where Nasrallah was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=184.1s)]
*  hiding along with other senior leaders. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=190.74s)]
*  So they've escaped that part of Beirut. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=193.06s)]
*  They've come from other parts of Lebanon that they fear are under attack. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=195.5s)]
*  And I can tell you, talking to people here, talking to people across the city, they are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=200.12s)]
*  deeply concerned that if Israel does invade, that Israel will invade with a tremendous [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=205.3s)]
*  amount of force. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=211.0s)]
*  Everyone here saw what happened and what continues to happen in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  They worry that the same thing will happen here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=218.78s)]
*  In fact, I just spoke to someone a short while ago who said that he thought perhaps Gaza [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  was the warm-up round for what could be coming in Lebanon. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=226.46s)]
*  Now, Israeli officials have been briefing off the record without using their names about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=230.62s)]
*  what to expect. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  They expect that there will be some sort of limited ground incursion to try and eliminate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=237.84s)]
*  Hezbollah fighters, to eliminate the weaponry that is still there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=243.34s)]
*  Over the last two weeks or so, they have successfully decapitated the organization, and it seems [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=247.9s)]
*  now Israel may be poised to push into this country to try and take out the rest of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  weapons or more of the weapons and some of the fighters themselves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=259.74s)]
*  And Hezbollah is estimated to have between 20,000, 40,000, Hezbollah says, up to 100,000 [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=263.26s)]
*  fighters, but many analysts say the number is probably closer to 40,000 active men ready [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=269.66s)]
*  to fight with arms. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E224nFQ6xAI&t=276.06s)]
