# 'This is not a game': Ex-Israeli PM reacts to Iran's missile attack
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg)
*  Joining us now, former Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Omeret. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us once again. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=3.96s)]
*  What is your response to what you witnessed today? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=6.38s)]
*  I think the picture is very clear. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=8.48s)]
*  Yesterday, you asked me whether we have adopted a policy of might, as you called it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, what we can see now is that Iran adopted a policy of might. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Very vicious, very aggressive, very provocative. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  180 ballistic missiles, warheads of approximately 1,000 kilos each, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=30.52s)]
*  some of them landing in the center of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  This is not a game, this is a serious event. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=43.4s)]
*  And I believe, I don't know, I don't speak for the government, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=48.8s)]
*  which you know very well, but I believe that there will be a counteroffensive by Israel, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=52.6s)]
*  and it will be a very painful counteroffensive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  I don't think that Israel wants to expand this into an all-out war with Iran, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=64.04s)]
*  but I don't think that there is any country in the world [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=72.36s)]
*  which has been attacked by 180 ballistic missiles of this size, this nature, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=75.8s)]
*  to the center of the country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=82.64s)]
*  And we're forcing 10 million people to sit in the shelters defending themselves from these missiles [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  that wouldn't react in a manner that would deter the attacker from repeating what they did. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  And I hope that this will be the nature of our reaction tonight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=102.2s)]
*  You know, Prime Minister, I have Alan Pinkes here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=106.28s)]
*  He thinks a retaliation is a bad idea and unnecessary. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  He says this was already Iran's retaliation for what Israel was able to do to the leader of Hezbollah [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=113.56s)]
*  and a Hamas leader inside of Iran, Ismail Haniyeh. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Is it a good idea to strike back and to make it, as you said, you believe it will be, painful? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=126.0s)]
*  I'm always amazed sometimes in the sense of humor of some. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=135.2s)]
*  Israel never took responsibility for the targeting of one individual that was hit, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=141.76s)]
*  who was a leader of a terrorist organization and was recognized as such by the international community. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=149.36s)]
*  We were attacked by Iran this evening with 180 ballistic missiles with warheads, each of 1,000 kilos. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Had they not been intercepted most of by Americans and Israelis? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=174.64s)]
*  America, we are grateful to America for assisting us to protect the Israelis from this terrible attack [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=182.12s)]
*  by helping us to intercept so many of these missiles. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  If I had one missile targeted one apartment building in the center of Tel Aviv, hundreds of people would have been killed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=196.56s)]
*  So this is not a matter of retaliation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  This is a matter of trying to put things in the right perspective for Iran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  The Iranians will continue to shoot missiles against Israel and will continue to supply these missiles [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  to Hezbollah and to Hamas and to the Iranian militias in Iraq and in Syria. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=223.92s)]
*  If they will not pay a certain price for doing it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  And I think that this has been clarified by the United States, by the State Department, by the president himself over the last few weeks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think that we have to think of how we can reduce the desire of the Iranians to carry on these attacks. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  And if we have to do it by using the exceptional capacities of Israel as they were manifested lately in Lebanon, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=252.32s)]
*  then I think we'll have to do it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=264.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Omer, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=267.08s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP5zh1ZI8Wg&t=271.12s)]
