# What Raisi's death means for the future of Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4)
*  Following the breaking news, Iranian state-run media is reporting the country's president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=0.0s)]
*  and foreign minister have both been killed in a helicopter crash. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  It happened in a foggy mountainous region in the northwest part of Iran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=9.68s)]
*  There were nine people on board at the time, leaving no survivors. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=15.52s)]
*  Iran's first vice president is now the acting president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=20.6s)]
*  The Middle East, already on a knife's edge over the war in Gaza, attacks on Red Sea shipping [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=24.12s)]
*  and nuclear brinksmanship. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=49.6s)]
*  And now more fuel for the flame. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=51.36s)]
*  The disruption of Iran's senior leadership. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=53.12s)]
*  The president's helicopter going down barely a month after Iran attacked Israel with hundreds [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=55.28s)]
*  of drones and missiles, Israel striking back, leaving the region holding its breath, fearing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  a regional war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  In the days after, Iran's foreign minister, also on the helicopter, speaking to NBC, issuing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=66.36s)]
*  this threat. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=71.32s)]
*  He says, if Israel takes a decisive action against my country and this is proven to us, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=72.32s)]
*  our response will be immediate and to the maximum and will cause them to regret it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=78.58s)]
*  So far, no signs of foul play in the downed helicopter. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Still, the ripple effects could be felt worldwide. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=86.2s)]
*  Raisi is a key protege of Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's ultimate decision maker. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  Since Raisi's election in 2021, he's overseen a crackdown on women's freedoms, sped up Iran's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=93.84s)]
*  nuclear program, Iran now enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels, and expanded [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  Iran's global reach, supplying Russia with weapons for its war in Ukraine and backing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Hamas in Gaza and proxy groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=108.88s)]
*  been attacking ships in the Red Sea. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Iran's constitution says if the president dies, the vice president takes over his role, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=116.24s)]
*  and a new election called within 50 days. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=120.92s)]
*  How that will change Iran is unknown, but with Raisi gone, the Middle East is once again [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=123.32s)]
*  holding its breath. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=128.32s)]
*  Josh Letterman, NBC News. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrHYsCFRt4&t=129.44s)]
