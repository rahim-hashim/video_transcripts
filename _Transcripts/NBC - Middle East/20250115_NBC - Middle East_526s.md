# New: Israel and Hamas reach ceasefire and hostage deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw)
*  Israel Hamas reached a ceasefire hostage deal today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=0.0s)]
*  It is set for implementation this Sunday with a hostage exchange coming, a hard-fought development [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=3.68s)]
*  that has set off celebrations on both sides, as you can see here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=8.66s)]
*  The negotiators reaching and announcing this deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=12.76s)]
*  In Israel, the cabinet must still ratify it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=15.08s)]
*  The hostage exchange will involve 33 Israeli hostages in Gaza, and it will be in exchange [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=17.68s)]
*  for Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=24.16s)]
*  From the American view, we can report tonight the deal contains a scheduled release of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=27.0s)]
*  American hostages. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=30.68s)]
*  Today, President Biden touted this foreign policy breakthrough. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=32.0s)]
*  Here's some of what he said as the news came out today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=36.24s)]
*  We begin with major breaking news out of the Middle East, where we can now report that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=41.26s)]
*  negotiators in Qatar have reached a Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  You know, there was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=49.8s)]
*  The implementation depends upon the parties as well as the goodwill of the parties. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=55.64s)]
*  I'm deeply satisfied. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=60.84s)]
*  This day has come, finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=63.08s)]
*  in agony. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=68.76s)]
*  Extraordinary news breaking out of the Middle East. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=69.76s)]
*  For the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  of the war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=77.2s)]
*  President Biden recounting those high costs in the region, where he has repeatedly put [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=79.04s)]
*  a focus of his administration and his personal diplomacy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=84.16s)]
*  The other voice that you just heard there was actually Qatar's leader discussing the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=87.72s)]
*  party's goodwill to follow through. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  He helped broker this deal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=92.72s)]
*  In Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu has not yet commented. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=94.6s)]
*  His administration says it is eyeing these final details that are being still hammered [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=97.4s)]
*  out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=102.28s)]
*  Hamas touts the deal as progress for Gaza, which has been reeling from the bombing and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=103.28s)]
*  the counterattacks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=109.2s)]
*  Over 40,000 have died there since Hamas launched the October 7th attack, taking the original [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=110.56s)]
*  roughly 250 hostages, innocent individuals taken from Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=116.04s)]
*  1,200 people also killed in Israel in that ensuing 15 months of fighting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=121.28s)]
*  Other observers in the region see the ceasefire as a step towards a possible, more durable [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=126.84s)]
*  truce. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=132.0s)]
*  This is major news in the Middle East being watched around the world tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  We are joined by Ambassador Dennis Ross. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=136.88s)]
*  He was a special envoy in Oslo where he dealt with both sides, Israel and the PLO, and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=139.66s)]
*  reaching a deal there, advising the president. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=144.34s)]
*  You can see he served as a peace negotiator in the Clinton administration, as well as [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=146.34s)]
*  under the Bush administration as a diplomat at stake. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=150.7s)]
*  He also, we should note, worked as a special assistant to the Obama administration. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  He has been in and around many of the challenges that beset this region for such a long time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=160.24s)]
*  We're also joined by someone who also served in the Clinton administration, David Rothkopf, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=165.82000000000002s)]
*  a diplomat who's authored several books, including Running the World. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=169.58s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=175.46s)]
*  Ambassador Ross, what is in the deal? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  How did it happen and why now? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=180.66s)]
*  Well, the deal is basically a deal that was presented initially by the Israelis in May [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=183.26000000000002s)]
*  to President Biden, who embraced it, presented it as a framework. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=192.78s)]
*  It has three basic phases to what would be a hostage release. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=197.26s)]
*  You have the first phase in which you would have about 33 Israeli hostages released. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  There would be a number of Palestinian prisoners who would also be released by the Israelis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=207.82s)]
*  Only in the second phase would you actually bring what is a temporary ceasefire and turn [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=214.42s)]
*  it into a permanencies fire where the rest of the hostages would be released and a large [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=219.34s)]
*  number of Palestinian prisoners would be released. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  That framework has been available essentially since the end of May. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=226.9s)]
*  So you might ask the question, as you did, why now? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  I would say there was a Trump effect. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  The Trump effect was on Bibi in the sense that Bibi was not going to say no to Trump, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=239.22000000000003s)]
*  fears the cost of saying no to Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=243.94s)]
*  There was a Trump effect also, I think, on Qatar and Egypt. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=246.82s)]
*  They want to please President Trump, and that means they wanted to show how they could do [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  things that would benefit or be responsive to what it is he wants. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=255.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to let you continue, but we have some of the reporting on what you're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=259.82s)]
*  saying, so I want to kind of match it up for viewers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=264.06s)]
*  Again, this is a major truce today. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=266.3s)]
*  And so The Times says, what you say, Ambassador, that this was broadly similar to a three-phase [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=269.82s)]
*  framework publicized by President Biden in May with the six-week ceasefire. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=275.04s)]
*  They've reviewed even a copy of the agreement as this was all unfolding today. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=280.24s)]
*  The same report notes that Donald Trump's threats that all hell would break loose if [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=284.12s)]
*  no deal was reached before his inauguration might have helped motivate Hamas's leadership. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=288.0s)]
*  And I want to play a little bit more from the president today to the ambassador's point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=294.12s)]
*  I'd also note this deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=300.32s)]
*  terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=306.88s)]
*  In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=311.2s)]
*  I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=315.64s)]
*  with the same voice, because that's what American presidents do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=321.64s)]
*  Ambassador Oz? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=326.52s)]
*  Look, I think the key here is that you actually have the Trump administration coming in committed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=328.52s)]
*  to the deal that was negotiated by the Biden administration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=335.84s)]
*  This is a 100-page document. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  So the Trump administration didn't negotiate that document, but they were critical. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=341.64s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, who is the new negotiator for President Trump, he flew directly from Qatar, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  flew from Doha to Jerusalem on Saturday, and from every report coming out of Israel, effectively [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=354.56s)]
*  told Prime Minister Netanyahu, you can't say no to this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=360.56s)]
*  Up until now, I think the political price of saying that he was going to end the war [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  was too high for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  He's still not saying that, by the way. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  What he'll be saying over the next couple of days is, we will only determine if the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  war ends, if all our needs are met, and we'll be negotiating that basically in the second [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=379.56s)]
*  phase. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=385.24s)]
*  That negotiation starts on day 16 of phase one. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=386.24s)]
*  Let me bring David, I know, your 100-page deal, and you speak in multi-pronged points, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=389.08s)]
*  which we appreciate you for, but David is patiently standing by. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=396.32s)]
*  So before we go further into phase two, your thoughts on all the above, David Rothkopf? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=400.16s)]
*  Well, I think Dennis has summarized it well, of course. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=404.4s)]
*  Well, he talks about a Trump effect. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  I think we should also talk about the Netanyahu effect. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=410.32s)]
*  Netanyahu has had many, many months in which he could have accepted this deal prior to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=414.2s)]
*  September late summer. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=421.4s)]
*  He couldn't for political reasons. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=423.08s)]
*  He was afraid that the right would leave his coalition. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=424.64s)]
*  That changed when a small party joined the coalition, and so he had a little bit more [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=428.24s)]
*  wiggle room. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  But even then, he has waited to see the outcome of the election. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=434.12s)]
*  I think part of this has to do with his desire to help Trump and to have Trump help him. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=438.36s)]
*  But as we get into the nitty-gritty of the deal, I think the important thing to remember [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=446.16s)]
*  is two million people in Gaza, 40,000 to 70,000 people dead, many, many people in desperate [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=453.16s)]
*  suffering. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=461.12s)]
*  And the fact that even in this first phase of the deal in which 600 truckloads of humanitarian [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=462.48s)]
*  aid are supposed to make it through to those people, it's unclear that they will. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=469.68s)]
*  It's unclear that the ceasefire will hold. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  And phase two of the ceasefire contains some very, very difficult provisions, ultimately [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=478.2s)]
*  getting us to the point that there is a new Hamas leadership. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=484.96s)]
*  And we're a long, long way for that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  So I think we should be thankful for the respite. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  We should be thankful for the hope. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=494.44s)]
*  We should be thankful that ultimately everybody came around to this deal. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=496.4s)]
*  But we should see it for what it is, which is just a first step and nothing complete. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40Q0ugDnXw&t=499.96s)]
