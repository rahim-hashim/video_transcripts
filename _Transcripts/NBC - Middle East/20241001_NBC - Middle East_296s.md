# 'Reverberations' of Iran's missile attack on Israel could change Middle East politics
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM)
*  John Brennan, from what we've seen so far, is it too early to say how serious this attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=0.0s)]
*  is and how successful the Israeli response has been? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=7.72s)]
*  Well, the Iranians are well known for their rhetorical saber rattling, and I think we've [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=11.56s)]
*  seen some of that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=17.84s)]
*  And it seems as though this was limited, although there were ballistic missiles that were fired [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=19.34s)]
*  at Israel, and that the Israelis and others were able to intercept. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=23.76s)]
*  And if there were no casualties, that's great. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  But the statement coming out of Iran makes it appear as though, at least on this salvo, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=33.22s)]
*  they feel as though they have satisfied the need to respond to the Israeli strikes against [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=43.46s)]
*  And so it may be just a repeat of what we saw in April. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=44.94s)]
*  And the Israelis may feel that they need to strike against Iranian targets inside of Iran [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=49.06s)]
*  because of these ballistic missile launches. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=54.22s)]
*  But hopefully, if there were no casualties on the ground in Israel, this is not going [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=57.54s)]
*  to be the trigger that would lead to a quick escalation and spiraling of this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=62.14s)]
*  But clearly, Iran feels that it cannot just stand idly by while its proxies are going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=68.14s)]
*  to be so destroyed and disrupted by Israel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=74.86s)]
*  But also, I just want to point out, I mean, there are many, many reasons for the conflict [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=79.8s)]
*  and the violence that has beset the Middle East for generations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=84.7s)]
*  But I think we also can agree that it's the collective failure to provide the Palestinians [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  self-determination that's been the case for the past 75 years that will continue to be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=94.34s)]
*  a stimulant for this continued cycle of violence and conflict and even war. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=99.28s)]
*  And so it's just very unfortunate that we continue to see that this one issue, one main [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=107.06s)]
*  issue of the Palestinians continues to be some of the principal reason for why we see [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  this continued cycle of violence that has led to so many deaths, including innocent [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  men, women and children on all sides. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, it's now been reported by Tom Winter and Monica Alba that there was an active [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  shooting incident around the time that the missile strikes first began. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=136.62s)]
*  The missiles were first fired, I should say. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=141.3s)]
*  A shooter got off mass transit, started firing a semi-automatic rifle. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=144.5s)]
*  It was an apparent terror attack, according to Israelis and U.S. officials who had been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=149.74s)]
*  briefed on the matter. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  The initial report, subject to change given this ongoing security situation, of course, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  is that eight individuals were killed, a number that may include the suspect or suspects. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  Nine individuals were wounded, according to one U.S. official briefed on the attack in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  this note from Tom Winter and Monica Alba. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=171.26s)]
*  And the nine people reported injured are all believed to not be members of law enforcement [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=174.7s)]
*  or Israeli security. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=178.98s)]
*  So before I move on and talk to some of our other guests, John, I wanted to also ask you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=181.2s)]
*  from your perspective as a former station chief in Saudi Arabia, what is your analysis [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=188.66s)]
*  of what Saudi Arabia is doing right now? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=196.14s)]
*  I think it's just watching and concerned that this is going to just blow up the region. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=199.82s)]
*  And they have to be concerned, given they have strong equities and interests across [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=206.14s)]
*  the area. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=211.74s)]
*  And if the attack in Tel Aviv is a harbinger of additional types of terrorist attacks, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=212.7s)]
*  both inside of Israel or outside, we really could see a very quick escalation of the state [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=218.54s)]
*  these tensions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=225.74s)]
*  So I do think Saudi Arabia, and we've already seen there's some real concerns about what [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=226.54s)]
*  this could do to the flow of oil and energy supplies to the Middle East, because this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=231.1s)]
*  does have the potential. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=236.54s)]
*  Right now, in the midst of this conflict, we don't know what other chapters are going [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=238.38s)]
*  to play out, but there is going to be reverberations of this in the coming days, weeks, months, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  and years that could be very, very profound and even change more the contours of politics [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=247.82s)]
*  inside the Middle East. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=255.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vVrTVnngM&t=285.66s)]
