# Russia prefers Iran to stir the pot in the Middle East to take attention away from Ukraine
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68)
*  New this morning, Iran warning Israel there will be larger attacks on its territory if [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=0.0s)]
*  there is any retaliation after yesterday's attacks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=6.26s)]
*  Also, Iran sending a message to the U.S. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=10.26s)]
*  Bases will be targeted if Washington backs any Israeli retaliation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=13.52s)]
*  Joining us now is Evelyn Farkas. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=18.32s)]
*  She is the former senior adviser to the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, former Deputy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, and former senior fellow [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=24.64s)]
*  for the Atlantic Council. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=29.68s)]
*  Also with us, former CIA and Department of Defense Chief of Staff, Jeremy Bash. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=36.8s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=37.8s)]
*  Jeremy, I want to start with you and pick up where Richard Engel left us off last hour. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=38.8s)]
*  Essentially, talking about the root of what we saw yesterday, goes all the way back two [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=43.92s)]
*  weeks ago, 13 days as Andrea Mitchell noted, to the attack, an Israeli attack on Iran in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=49.16s)]
*  Damascus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=56.96s)]
*  Why would, at the point in time that we find ourselves in, in the world with Hamas at Israel's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=58.92s)]
*  doorstep, why would Israel take such a step? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=66.4s)]
*  And as Richard Engel suggests that folks in the region have noted, is that what Netanyahu [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=70.92s)]
*  wants is the wider conflict with Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=76.56s)]
*  What say you, Jeremy? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, Simone, there's a view inside Israel, and I think inside many in the U.S. national [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  security community, that Iran really is the reason why there's been so much instability [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=85.84s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=91.52s)]
*  So if you look at not just the October 7th attacks, where of course Hamas is a proxy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=92.52s)]
*  of Iran, receives funding from Iran, but also all of the violence perpetrated by Iranian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=97.88s)]
*  Shia militia groups against U.S. forces, killing three U.S. troops back at the beginning of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=102.88s)]
*  this year, attacking ships via the Houthis in the Red Sea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=108.12s)]
*  Iran is really the reason why there's so much conflict in the region. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  And so Israel is saying, we've got to kind of go to the head of the snake, and the head [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=116.76s)]
*  of the snake is the leadership of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=120.76s)]
*  It's the same reason why the United States, under the previous administration, took out [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=124.2s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani in December 2019. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=129.18s)]
*  But in that case, I think Iran believe we can't take on the United States. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=132.4s)]
*  They're too formidable of an ally. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=136.08s)]
*  And I think they believe that Israel may be on its back heels from the perspective of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  international public opinion. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=142.28s)]
*  And so they've done something unprecedented here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  They've launched attacks against Israel's homeland inside Israeli territory. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  We've never seen that overt, massive attack by Iran against Israel before in history. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=150.48s)]
*  I will note, U.S., senior U.S. officials coming into the Biden administration, we were doing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=155.6s)]
*  all these kind of briefings, and everyone would say the same thing, that Iran is the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  greatest threat to the United States. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  Evelyn, National Security, NSC spokesperson, Kirby, who is on, meet the press with our [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=167.92s)]
*  colleague Kristen Welker, and she asked him about what has transpired in the past 24 hours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=174.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=178.72s)]
*  What's your response to Americans who see those missiles being intercepted in the skies [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  overnight and believe that this has already escalated? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=185.92s)]
*  I would ask the Americans that saw what happened last night to take heart in terms of the military [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  capability of their forces in the region, how they are defending themselves and defending [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=196.74s)]
*  our interests in the region. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=201.9s)]
*  And also, I reiterate what I said before. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=204.02s)]
*  Know that the president is working the diplomatic side of this personally. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=208.46s)]
*  It's that last piece from Kirby that I want to pick up on, the president working the diplomatic [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=213.38s)]
*  side of this personally. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Your sense of what that looks like, the resources that the president has at his disposal? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=218.78s)]
*  Yeah, Alicia, I mean, we know right from the very beginning, you know, from going back [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=224.26s)]
*  to October when the attacks occurred on the Israeli people, you know, launched from Gaza [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=228.94s)]
*  by the Hamas terrorists, who, of course, are Iranian proxies, that right from the beginning, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  President Biden wanted to make sure that the conflict that was coming, because, of course, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=242.62s)]
*  knew Israel would have to take action to get root out those terrorists, he wanted to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=247.38s)]
*  make sure that the conflict would not spread further. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=254.18s)]
*  We saw Iran's proxies, though, you know, spreading the conflict. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  We saw the Houthis trying to cut off maritime commerce in the Red Sea. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=261.1s)]
*  We saw Hezbollah attacking Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=265.26s)]
*  But all along, if you paid close attention to what the administration was saying and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=267.86s)]
*  in terms of putting U.S. forces, stationing forces in the Middle East, surging forward there, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=273.38s)]
*  if you will, mostly on the sea and in the air, we were essentially saying to Iran, you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  keep this at a low simmer. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  And just one other point, back in January, the Israelis assassinated a high-level Hamas [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=287.94s)]
*  leader in Lebanon. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=296.26s)]
*  And at that point, we were really afraid that Iran might take action like this, or maybe [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  not exactly like this, but Iran might take escalatory action. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  And actually, it didn't. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  The word, according to press reports, was that Iran told its proxies to cool it, and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  they decided not to take action at that point in time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=313.94s)]
*  AARON MATEHUM, HON. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=316.58s)]
*  JOSEPH BIDEN, PRESIDENT, U.S. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=317.38s)]
*  COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, CALLING FOR RESTRINGT AFTER THIS ATTACK, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  NOTING THAT WE EXPRESS OUR EXTREME CONCERN OVER ANOTHER DANGEROUS ESCALATION IN THE REGION. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=322.58000000000004s)]
*  RUSSIAN'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID IN A STATEMENT ON THE IRANIAN ATTACKS, WE CALL ON ALL PARTIES [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=329.22s)]
*  INVOLVED TO EXERCISE RESTRINGT. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=334.82s)]
*  HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE RUSSIAN ASSESSMENT OF THIS MATTER? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=337.22s)]
*  Do you think they're just going to sort of hold back? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=343.14s)]
*  Are they going to lean in? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=345.54s)]
*  They're going to sort of get in Iran's ear a little bit and say, OK, you guys just need [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=346.74s)]
*  to bring it down a notch? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  How do you see Russia playing a role to some extent in this? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=351.94s)]
*  MR. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=356.5s)]
*  SIEGEL, FOREIGN MINISTRY FOREIGN MINISTRY, CALLING FOR RESTRINGT AFTER THIS ATTACK, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=356.7s)]
*  NOTENING THAT WE EXPRESS OUR EXTREME CONCERN OVER ANOTHER DANGEROUS ESCALATION IN THE REGION. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=356.9s)]
*  Great question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=356.98s)]
*  I actually think Russia has zero credibility. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=357.54s)]
*  They've gained a lot of support from Iran. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=359.94s)]
*  In fact, many of the drones on the battlefield in Ukraine are Iranian Shahed drones, some of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=362.02s)]
*  the similar drones that Iran launched last night against Israel. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=367.38s)]
*  And I think actually Russia prefers Iran to stir the pot in the Middle East. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=371.7s)]
*  It takes world attention away from Russia, Ukraine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=376.42s)]
*  You see, obviously, this Ukraine bill stalled on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=379.46s)]
*  Russia's kind of enjoying seeing that play out. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=383.54s)]
*  And as far as Russia's concerned, they would much rather have the United States and the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=386.5s)]
*  international community focused on a conflict between Israel and Iran than the conflict in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=390.5s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=394.5s)]
*  MR. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=394.98s)]
*  SIEGEL, FOREIGN MINISTRY FOREIGN MINISTRY, CALLING FOR RESTRINGT AFTER THIS ATTACK, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  NOTENING THAT WE EXPRESS OUR EXTREME CONCERN OVER ANOTHER DANGEROUS ESCALATION IN THE REGION. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=395.3s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense, because you have this idea now that this space is narrowed and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=395.38s)]
*  moved in a different direction away from the pressure to bring dollars to support Ukraine. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=402.18s)]
*  And so Russia, doing a little profiling here and saying everybody needs to settle down, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=407.78s)]
*  and the U.S. don't get too headstrong. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=412.9s)]
*  Iran, don't you get too headstrong trying to play that sort of middle space when [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  they're really kind of happy that they're not getting the fresh start. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=420.5s)]
*  I mean, it is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=423.7s)]
*  Evelyn, on the point that Jeremy just made, you have President Zelensky of Ukraine, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  who tweeted about the drones. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  He said, Ukraine condemns Iran's attack on Israel using Shahed drones and missiles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  We in Ukraine know very well the horror of similar attacks by Russia, which uses the same [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=435.94s)]
*  Shahed drones and Russian missiles, the same tactics of mass airstrikes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=440.26s)]
*  There is a story that posted around 1 a.m. and the Washington Post this morning that talks about [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=444.58s)]
*  the drones that saturate the sky over Ukraine, looking for any movement. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=450.26s)]
*  And as every day goes by that Ukraine has not received the aid from the supplemental package, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=455.62s)]
*  and just to be clear, the aid is money that would go to the Pentagon to buy weapons that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=464.98s)]
*  are made in America to send to Ukraine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=469.22s)]
*  They slip deeper and deeper into peril on the front lines. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=471.70000000000005s)]
*  Yes, Simone, this is Zelensky clapping right back at the Russians. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=478.1s)]
*  He's like, yeah, you guys don't want escalation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  You guys are the ones who are working with Iran on all of this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=484.18s)]
*  I mean, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if later we found out in the history books [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=487.38s)]
*  that Russia was tipped off about the Hamas attack, maybe not exactly on the date in October when [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=491.7s)]
*  they launched it, but that the Russians were more than happy to let their Iranian friends [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=498.18s)]
*  and the Iranian proxies do what they had to do or what they thought they had to do vis-à-vis [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=503.86s)]
*  the innocent Israeli civilians. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=508.82s)]
*  So, you know, Russia has blood on its hands. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=511.38s)]
*  These missiles are also being, not missiles rather, the drones are also being manufactured [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=515.54s)]
*  down in Russia. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=520.34s)]
*  So the Iranians not only are giving drones to Russia, but they've helped them set up [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=520.98s)]
*  factories. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=525.5400000000001s)]
*  The Russians, I understand, have actually made those drones even better. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=526.1s)]
*  The Ukrainians, I was there two weeks ago and we felt the barrage of drones and artillery. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=529.86s)]
*  So this is very real every day for people in Ukraine, this Iranian drone threat. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  STEPHANIE SY, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The Washington Post [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=540.9s)]
*  Jeremy, I hope you will take this question in the spirit in which I am asking it, which is, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=541.38s)]
*  who, if anyone here, believes they benefit from regional escalation? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=547.22s)]
*  Jeremy Zinke, Director, The Washington Post [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=551.7s)]
*  Nobody believes they benefit from regional escalation, except for, I think, the leadership [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=554.0200000000001s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=560.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, Iran believes that, for internal purposes, if they can focus on an external enemy, the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=561.94s)]
*  quote-unquote Zionist enemy or the great Satan in the United States, then that potentially [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  fortifies their leadership. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=572.82s)]
*  I mean, they are autocrats. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=574.1s)]
*  They rule over a population of people who don't want to be led by the theocracy in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=575.7800000000001s)]
*  Tehran. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=582.1s)]
*  And so there have been revolutions. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=582.98s)]
*  There have been green revolutions. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=584.98s)]
*  There have been other demonstrations in the streets. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  We know the treatment against women by the Iranian regime. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=588.5s)]
*  So I think they need an external enemy in some ways to keep and maintain control in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=592.1800000000001s)]
*  Iran. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=597.86s)]
*  And they're picking on the smallest country in the region, the American ally, the country [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=598.26s)]
*  that sort of doesn't fit in with other countries there. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=602.74s)]
*  And they believe that's going to maybe fortify their regime. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=605.54s)]
*  But it's not going to work because America's got Israel's back in these defensive measures [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=608.42s)]
*  forward of this attack almost completely. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=612.9s)]
*  Evelyn, the president is convening the G7 partners today and conversating with them [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=614.98s)]
*  to update them, also, I think, to put together some level of diplomatic response and maybe [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=621.78s)]
*  some level of coordination over the next week. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  How do you assess what we may see coming out of that conversation with our G7 partners? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=632.5s)]
*  So it's sort of, Michael, related to the couple of questions you guys just asked, because [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=640.02s)]
*  I think that Iran actually doesn't want this to escalate. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=646.9s)]
*  I don't think just like the January episode, this time they, yes, they used an attack directly [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  in Israel, which is escalatory. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  But remember, they said, OK, we consider this now done. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=658.5s)]
*  We're done now. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=662.5s)]
*  And so now the worry is, what is Israel going to do? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=664.42s)]
*  I think that the administration managed to convince Netanyahu, fingers crossed, because [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=666.74s)]
*  there were, thankfully, very little in the way of casualties, I think just one injury, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=672.26s)]
*  that Israel will not escalate, will not strike back directly at Iran, hopefully. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=678.26s)]
*  But I think the G7 needs to really buckle down and get this situation under control. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=684.66s)]
*  So I think Biden's saying to our allies, listen, we need to provide assistance to Ukraine. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=688.98s)]
*  We need to provide assistance to Israel. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=693.86s)]
*  We need to provide assistance to Taiwan. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=696.02s)]
*  All these things are interconnected because the bad guys are working together. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=697.86s)]
*  It's not just Russia and Iran working together. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=701.54s)]
*  China's helping Russia with its war effort. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=703.86s)]
*  And of course, North Korea. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=706.74s)]
*  So it's really important for the democracies of the world, the strongest economies, to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=708.34s)]
*  stick together and work diplomatically to resolve this, use our military deterrent and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=712.9s)]
*  our economic power to do so as well. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvY7c5l7q68&t=718.42s)]
