# Hopes are high for the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g)
*  A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will go into effect in less than 24 hours after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's full cabinet approved the deal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=4.64s)]
*  Fighting in the Gaza Strip will be paused Sunday at 1.30 a.m. Eastern. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=7.36s)]
*  The deal starts with a six-week truce and involves several phases. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=11.96s)]
*  Most Israeli forces will withdraw to the Gaza border, and Hamas will free 33 hostages in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=15.6s)]
*  exchange for 100 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli prisons. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=20.84s)]
*  According to a portion of the deal shared by Hamas, Israel will also release another [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=26.08s)]
*  1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were not involved in the October 7th attacks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=30.64s)]
*  Joining us now, former Democratic congresswoman of California, Jane Herman. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=35.44s)]
*  She's also the chair of the Commission on the National Defense Strategy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=38.84s)]
*  Good morning, congresswoman. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=41.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=43.96s)]
*  Good morning, congresswoman. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=45.56s)]
*  You know, this is such an amazing turn considering the ebb and flow of this crisis from [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=48.16s)]
*  October 7th to the day and at times the appearance of a lack of movement or a sense that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=56.2s)]
*  folks did not want this to move. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=63.72s)]
*  But here we are now, and it is a blessing to have this breakthrough. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=65.88s)]
*  What does this mean for Gazans at this point? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=71.64s)]
*  What can they look for as this idea of now rebuilding at the end of this becomes a new reality for them? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=75.08s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  First, let's stop quibbling about who deserves credit. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump deserves some credit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=92.28s)]
*  Biden deserves some credit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=93.64s)]
*  Let's see the deal happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  And oh, by the way, two American hostages are being released tomorrow, supposed to be released. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't think anybody's asking about their political affiliation, at least not yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=102.28s)]
*  So let's get over that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=106.6s)]
*  For Palestinians, there are supposed to be 600 relief trucks per day [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=108.36s)]
*  delivering humanitarian aid that has been so lacking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=114.68s)]
*  And also the Palestinian Authority will assume some responsibility for governance there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  That means Hamas will not be running Gaza, but the PA will. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  That's good news. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=128.52s)]
*  The PA needs massive reforms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=129.56s)]
*  But hey, at least it's a government that will be in place. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  What I'm worried about, Michael, though, is phase two and three. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=136.44s)]
*  I can see this part of the deal happening, and it's a huge relief. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=140.6s)]
*  But phase two and three involves some progress toward some form of state for the Palestinians. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=145.0s)]
*  And there, I think there could be a huge problem with the Trump administration. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=153.4s)]
*  His incoming ambassador, Mike Huckabee, is a born-again Christian and has said he doesn't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=157.48s)]
*  have a problem with Israel annexing the West Bank, the right-wing government of Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=163.24s)]
*  especially Ben Gavir and Smotrich, are in favor of annexing the West Bank. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=170.84s)]
*  That's where most of the Palestinians are. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  And I can also see another attempt, which is many Israelis abhor, to politicize the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=177.32s)]
*  Israeli Supreme Court. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=183.72s)]
*  So this is bad news. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=184.92s)]
*  Where will Bibi be? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=186.68s)]
*  Why doesn't he take advantage of the opportunity to change his coalition? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm guessing if he would do that, a pardon might be in his future as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  He would then go down as a peacemaker, and instead we may be going right back to war, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  unbelievably right back to war and endangering, for example, Jordan, the neighbor of Israel, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=203.4s)]
*  which has made peace with Israel for decades, but which has a huge Palestinian population, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=210.68s)]
*  which will be destabilized if there is a move to annex the West Bank. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman, you lay out the stakes here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  And Sunday is one step. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=222.52s)]
*  It is a very important step. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=226.12s)]
*  It is a step that many people were skeptical that we would ever come to see. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=227.8s)]
*  But there are many more steps after that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=234.28s)]
*  In the absence of a partner in the United States that is willing to have a tough conversation [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=236.44s)]
*  with our friend and ally, the state of Israel, I don't think that President Trump is going to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=242.6s)]
*  be exerting any kind of pressure, if you will, on Prime Minister Netanyahu and his right-wing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=249.72s)]
*  coalition to adhere to humanitarian standards or to get that, to pressure for a Palestinian state, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=254.84s)]
*  if you will. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=265.0s)]
*  So who steps up in that void? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=265.64s)]
*  Is this where some of the other G7 countries come into play? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=267.8s)]
*  Does France take an outsized role here? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=271.8s)]
*  Who is going to step up in the void of pressure from the Americans? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=274.28s)]
*  Well, good question. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=280.2s)]
*  The G7 can play a role. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=281.56s)]
*  Let's understand France's government is in transition at the moment. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=283.4s)]
*  And the current leader might go away pretty quickly. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=287.96s)]
*  Germany's government is in transition too. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=292.6s)]
*  So the strong leaders in Europe aren't so strong. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=294.6s)]
*  But I can see another play that would interest President Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=298.12s)]
*  And that is the deal he has sought for years, or the expanded deal, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=302.28s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and some of the other states in that region. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=308.2s)]
*  He wants that deal. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=315.32s)]
*  It's an economic deal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=316.36s)]
*  I'm sure there are some good consequences for his son-in-law and other things if that deal were to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  happen. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=325.24s)]
*  But I'm saying if he wants that deal, he's going to have to tamp down a move to annex the West Bank [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=326.44s)]
*  and do things that the Saudis have said are completely unacceptable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=334.2s)]
*  So he may have a balancing act here that could turn out better than I fear. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  But if this is going in a direction that phase two and three blow up and we go right back to war, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=343.32s)]
*  or Israel goes right back to war with Gaza, this would be a human tragedy on a scale we [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=349.88s)]
*  haven't even seen yet. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  Let's stay there, Congresswoman, because of course the Qataris played a big role in this negotiation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=356.36s)]
*  You've referenced what this could mean for Jordan. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  When you step back and look at the region more broadly, what are the regional interests in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=365.0s)]
*  trying to make sure that the forthcoming phases of this deal hold? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  And if you're talking about sticks and carrots for Netanyahu, who is actually poised outside of the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  United States to offer those? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=379.72s)]
*  Well, that's a hard question to answer. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=382.36s)]
*  I don't think Netanyahu is hugely popular in the region, especially after the last [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=385.56s)]
*  year plus. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=391.88s)]
*  And I'm not saying Israel did not have a right to defend itself. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=392.6s)]
*  Israel did have a right to defend herself. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=396.04s)]
*  But I'm saying going forward, there are some new opportunities which I hope won't be lost. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=398.28s)]
*  So that's where I come out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=402.44s)]
*  Who could pressure them? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=405.0s)]
*  Well, Egypt and Jordan are the neighbors who made peace with Israel and have some sway. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=406.28s)]
*  The Sunni Arab states, as you mentioned, have played an outsized role. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=414.12s)]
*  And Israel was a startup nation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=417.88s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what state Israel's economy is in now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=421.24s)]
*  And so it has an interest. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=424.68s)]
*  And I think the prime minister of Israel has an interest in rebooting that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=426.12s)]
*  So I think the neighborhood, I don't know what to say about the G7. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=430.12s)]
*  I think maybe a country like Turkey could play a role, maybe some others. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=434.44s)]
*  Let's understand that Syria and Lebanon have chutes and leaves breaking out. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=440.52s)]
*  They have the beginning of decent governments after years of really failed state status. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=446.84s)]
*  And so they will be interested in those interested in them, Turkey being one, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=455.23999999999995s)]
*  will be interested, I hope, in more peace in the region. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=460.52s)]
*  And finally, let's not forget Iran. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=463.96s)]
*  Israel did cause huge harm to Iran by taking out, effectively, its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  and hurting the Houthis. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=475.0s)]
*  So Iran's going to want to play, and the region's going to not want Iran to go nuclear and play [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=476.76s)]
*  in the role that it has played. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=483.32s)]
*  So I think there could be common cause trying to rein in Iran. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=484.6s)]
*  And I think some progress could be made. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=489.08s)]
*  And it was Biden's policy not to let Iran go nuclear. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  I can't imagine that a president-elect Trump would want to break that policy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=495.8s)]
*  We will all be watching and waiting to see what happens. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=500.76s)]
*  Former Congressman Jane Harman, thank you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f59fXV2SF7g&t=503.47999999999996s)]
