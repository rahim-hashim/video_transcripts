# Iran sees ‘democracy and freedom as their enemy’: Dem Rep on Trump’s decision to strike
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM)
*  And joining us now, New Jersey Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer, who as Melanie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=0.0s)]
*  mentioned, tweeted his support for the Iran strikes over the weekend. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=4.16s)]
*  Congressman, great to have you with us. First, your reaction to the ceasefire deal that was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=7.68s)]
*  announced overnight, although it does appear to be a little bit tenuous. Did President Trump's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=11.84s)]
*  strategy work? Obviously very positive news, right? After 12 days of strikes, Iran is cornered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=16.72s)]
*  Their nuclear program significantly degraded. Obviously no Americans in harm's way, which is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=24.639999999999997s)]
*  most important. And let's just remember that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terror. We can't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=32.8s)]
*  allow them to have a nuclear weapon. They've killed scores and scores of Americans, obviously [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  threatened our allies, but they see us as an enemy, just like we see them as one of our top adversaries. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=43.68s)]
*  And so there's no sympathy here and for what hopefully will be an outcome where [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=49.04s)]
*  there is no nuclear development in Iran and that the country and the leadership there and the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  military leadership obviously significantly weakened. Last night, the president said the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=62.08s)]
*  ceasefire would last forever. And here was the vice president. The president without knock on wood, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=67.52s)]
*  having a single American casualty obliterated the Iranian nuclear program. We are now in a place [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=76.8s)]
*  where we weren't a week ago. A week ago, Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon. Now [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=82.88s)]
*  Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=87.76s)]
*  So that's a very, very big thing. 12 hours later, the president says both sides already violated [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  this ceasefire deal. So is it really mission accomplished? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=99.12s)]
*  Well, I think this is the movement you want in the right direction. And obviously we haven't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=102.32s)]
*  seen the intelligence to see the outcome of the attacks yet and obviously of their capabilities. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=107.6s)]
*  We know that it's been degraded. The question I'm going to have, of course, is how much, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  what's next? But we do know that overall, after these days of strikes, that Iran has been [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  greatly weakened, their military leadership greatly weakened, which is critical to America's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  national security. And to me, that's the headline here, right? Iran is a adversary of the United [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=127.2s)]
*  States. They see democracy and freedom as their enemy. They are not only against human rights, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=133.2s)]
*  but they have a long record, whether it's against women, against gay people, of violating human [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=140.16s)]
*  rights and have zero openness to the kind of democracy and freedom that we are so proud of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=145.68s)]
*  here in the United States. So as far as I'm concerned, the steps taken so far are a big win [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=150.88s)]
*  for the United States. And now we've got to focus on what's next and making sure we keep this ceasefire [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=156.88s)]
*  in place, ensuring that they never get a nuclear weapon, that they can't further enrich. Right now, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=162.48s)]
*  we believe that 60 percent has been reported publicly. We can't ever allow them to break out [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=168.32s)]
*  to have a nuclear weapon. And that, to me, is critically important, as well as stopping [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=172.88s)]
*  as the leading state sponsor of terror in the region and in the world. We have to make sure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=177.28s)]
*  that program and their efforts there through all their proxies continue to be shut down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=182.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm hearing you say you're not 100 percent sure that the nuclear program is a done deal, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  like we heard expressed by the vice president. Until I see that, until I see, of course, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  evidence of that, and that's why I'm on the Intelligence Committee, until we see that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=198.24s)]
*  information, it's critically important, which is, by the way, also to leading into this, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  which I think a very important point that's made, the fact that the White House did not brief the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=205.76s)]
*  full gang of eight, the leadership, is unacceptable to me. And that's not, obviously, protocol. And [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=210.08s)]
*  they should make sure that going forward, and I've made that clear to the White House, too, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  going forward, that they brief the leadership and, of course, the Intelligence Committee. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  So a lot of people in your party called the president's order to strike Iran without [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  congressional approval unconstitutional. You've expressed support for the strikes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=228.8s)]
*  But do you believe they should have come to Congress first? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=234.0s)]
*  I think what—I think the key going forward, which is really the question now, if they want to extend [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=237.84s)]
*  the attacks further and obviously prolong this involvement, then they should come to Congress. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=245.12s)]
*  I think they followed the War Powers resolution. They notified Congress, as, by the way, former [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  presidents have as well, looking at President Clinton with Kosovo, Libya with President Obama. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=256.24s)]
*  You know, when there is an imminent threat, a nuclear threat to the United States of America, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=261.36s)]
*  it makes sense to go in to act decisively. America led here, and I'm very proud of the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=265.92s)]
*  leadership of our service members and what they accomplished. And we should be very proud of them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=270.32s)]
*  But the key, again, I think it was really important. The president should have notified [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=275.2s)]
*  the gang of eight. I think going forward, if this is going to be a protracted involvement, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=278.88s)]
*  then they should come to the Congress. But otherwise, I think we should look at this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=284.32s)]
*  from what it was. It was a very successful attack on an enemy of the United States that has been [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  long involved in killing Americans, going after our service members, attacking our bases, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=294.08s)]
*  either directly or through their proxies. And so this is a big win for the United States. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=298.8s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  we appreciate your perspective. Thanks for joining us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=305.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=308.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXnep7_96VM&t=324.08s)]
