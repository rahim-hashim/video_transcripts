# America 'can’t remain on the sidelines': Rep. Yvette Clarke on U.S. responsibility in Syria
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M)
*  This is Syria raising major questions about the future of U.S. foreign policy under Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=4.28s)]
*  The U.S. has approximately 900 troops on the ground in Syria. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=5.28s)]
*  It has also provided more than $12 billion in humanitarian assistance in the region since [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=8.24s)]
*  the start of the crisis, more than a billion dollars in stabilization efforts since 2011. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=12.84s)]
*  That's according to the State Department. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=17.48s)]
*  Now, world leaders are waiting to see if that could all change with Republicans about to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=19.2s)]
*  be in total control in Washington. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=23.92s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic congresswoman from New York, Yvette D. Clark. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=26.04s)]
*  She sits on the House Homeland Security Committee and is the incoming chair of the Congressional [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=29.2s)]
*  Black Caucus. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=33.32s)]
*  Good morning and congratulations, Congresswoman. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=35.04s)]
*  All the best in the new role. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=37.72s)]
*  Herding cats comes to mind, but you know what that's all about, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=40.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=45.76s)]
*  On a very serious point, I want to share with you NBC's news reporting this morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Quote, the United States will continue its operations in eastern Syria and take all necessary [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=52.76s)]
*  steps to prevent the Islamic State's resurgence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=57.64s)]
*  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Daniel Shapiro, announced [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=64.92s)]
*  What role do you see the U.S. playing now as the game is changing on the ground there? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  You had President-elect Trump this morning basically saying China and Russia, you handle [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=74.44s)]
*  it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=79.12s)]
*  Haven't heard anything official yet, as far as I can tell, from the Biden administration. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=80.12s)]
*  What do you assess is going to happen next or should happen next? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=86.36s)]
*  Well, I don't know what's going to happen next, but I believe that what should happen [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=92.08s)]
*  next is that the United States can't remain on the sidelines. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=97.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, terrorism is terrorism. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=102.64s)]
*  And if we are not vigilant with respect to this new development in Syria, we can be creating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=107.4s)]
*  a hornet's nest. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=118.0s)]
*  It's always important for the United States to pursue democratic values and to assist [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  those who are of like mind. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=126.76s)]
*  Syrian people want freedom. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=130.24s)]
*  And my hope is that they will pursue a democratic pathway to governance going forward and that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  they don't enable terrorist organizations to commandeer the governance of the people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=141.8s)]
*  At the end of the day, they were fleeing from their ruler because of his heavy-handedness. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  So I don't believe that the U.S. should be at all on the sidelines. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=159.96s)]
*  We must engage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=164.38s)]
*  Congresswoman, in the last hour, we had your colleague on the Homeland Security Committee, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=165.38s)]
*  Congressman Eric Swalwell, on with us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  We asked if you all had received yet a classified briefing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=172.88s)]
*  He said you had not, that he anticipated that briefing would come on Monday when you return [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  to the Hill. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=180.24s)]
*  What questions will you have specifically as you attempt to assess whether or not HTS [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=181.36s)]
*  is in fact moderating as they say they are? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=189.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's going to be important for us to get a briefing on what we knew when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=192.64s)]
*  we knew it, who the leadership is and what their backgrounds are. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be important for us to unpack this so that we are engaging with as much [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=202.16s)]
*  intelligence as possible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  And again, looking at how the Congress can bolster the work that has to come out of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=210.68s)]
*  executive branch in order to make sure that there's stability going forward. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=219.28s)]
*  It's going to be challenging. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=223.24s)]
*  There's no doubt about it, but that's our role in the world, and I think that we need [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  to maintain that integrity. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, let's bring the questions a little bit closer to home, a little bit more in your [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=230.56s)]
*  backyard. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=236.44s)]
*  The House and Senate are prepared to assume the leadership of the Black Caucus as the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=237.44s)]
*  Black Chronicle notes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  Clark now steps in as the caucus prepares for its largest membership in history. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=245.0s)]
*  With 62 members in the House and Senate, Clark's tenure will focus on combating civil rights [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=249.64s)]
*  erosion and ensuring economic health care and educational opportunities for Black Americans. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=255.68s)]
*  This historic transition marks a significant moment for the CBC as it remains at the forefront [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=262.36s)]
*  of the nation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=268.56s)]
*  So the realities of what's happening in foreign policy, certainly domestic policy, offers [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=270.16s)]
*  an opportunity under your new leadership for the Black Caucus to play an elevated role. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=277.38s)]
*  How do you see that role in matters of state and foreign affairs as members of Congress? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=283.2s)]
*  Because oftentimes, I'll be straight up, African American representation in the House [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=291.04s)]
*  by a lot of people outside House should be well, you know, that has nothing to do with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=297.44s)]
*  HUD, so don't talk about it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=301.24s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=303.12s)]
*  And ironically enough, Michael, the two areas that you just spoke about, particularly with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=304.12s)]
*  respect to security, are headed by CBC members. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  Ranking member Benny Thompson heads up the Homeland Security Committee, and ranking member [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=316.24s)]
*  Gregory Meeks heads up the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=322.0s)]
*  So our finger is always on the pulse of what is taking place on Capitol Hill, both domestically [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=325.32s)]
*  and internationally. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=331.66s)]
*  When you talk about HUD, now you're talking about Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a financial [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=332.88s)]
*  services committee ranking member. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=339.2s)]
*  We have the largest number of CBC members in the history of the United States in the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=342.74s)]
*  legislative body, and members are on every committee of jurisdiction, in addition to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=348.38s)]
*  having four members in the United States Senate, two of whom are new to the body, two women, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=354.58s)]
*  as a matter of fact, who are new to the body and are CBC members. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=362.06s)]
*  I expect that we will cover all subject matter. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=365.3s)]
*  However, we will be focused on the impact of people of African descent. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=369.7s)]
*  We will be focused on advancing legislation that helps the human condition with the focus [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=374.82s)]
*  on the black communities across this nation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=382.06s)]
*  Congresswoman, this from Politico, your mayor, Eric Adams, not ruling out a switch to the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=385.9s)]
*  GOP, saying cancel me. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=392.54s)]
*  The mayor set to sit down with Tom Holman. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=394.06s)]
*  The incoming borders are next week. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=395.94s)]
*  We'll talk about plans to deport undocumented immigrants. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  Adams has said he would support any federal plan that focuses on those undocumented immigrants [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  who have committed serious crimes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=404.26000000000005s)]
*  This is where we see the municipal and the federal collide. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=405.82000000000005s)]
*  We know that there are other blue state governors, blue state mayors, who are saying they're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  going to hold the line on some of the policies of this incoming administration. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  Do you think you're going to be able to work with Mayor Adams to do just that? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=419.34000000000003s)]
*  It's my hope. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=425.58000000000004s)]
*  I hope that he will see the virtue in what we have witnessed in terms of the draconian [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=426.58s)]
*  measures that the Trump administration has taken in the past. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=436.85999999999996s)]
*  New Yorkers are no stranger to Donald Trump and him executing on a very harsh and cruel [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  immigration policy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  As a matter of fact, right here in the 9th district of New York, in the last Trump administration, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=453.86s)]
*  we saw ICE officers for the first time patrolling local communities, and that's been unheard [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=460.1s)]
*  of. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=467.74s)]
*  And so we want to make sure that our mayor, Mayor Eric Adams, stays true to the values [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=468.74s)]
*  of the people of the city of New York, which is the gateway, which has always historically [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=476.82s)]
*  been the portal for immigrants to the United States of America. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=481.02s)]
*  We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=485.94s)]
*  We have Ellis Island in our harbor. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=489.14s)]
*  And so we understand what it is when people risk everything to live out their American [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=491.82s)]
*  dream. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g6GrSxX8M&t=498.82s)]
