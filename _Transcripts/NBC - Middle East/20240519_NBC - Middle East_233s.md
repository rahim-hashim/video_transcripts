# Two on board Iran President Raisi's crashed helicopter contacted rescuers
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8)
*  We searched for Iran's president who was on board a helicopter that crashed today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=0.0s)]
*  Josh Lederman has an update for us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=4.24s)]
*  I know you're following it from London. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=6.08s)]
*  What do you know, Josh? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  We're just getting some information, Alex, from the vice president of Iran, the executive [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=11.08s)]
*  vice president, Mohsen Mansouri. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  He's been speaking on state television, and he has revealed that rescuers have actually [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=17.52s)]
*  made contact with two people who were aboard that helicopter. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=22.72s)]
*  They say that those two people who were on the helicopter have made contact with rescue forces. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=27.78s)]
*  Now they're not disclosing at this point what they have learned from those conversations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=34.18s)]
*  And obviously the big question everyone has, what is the status of President Raisi and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=38.38s)]
*  the others on board? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=43.54s)]
*  But according to the executive vice president of Iran, he says that the helicopter took [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=44.82s)]
*  off about 1 p.m. local time, and by 1.30, contact with the helicopter was lost. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=49.5s)]
*  We know that the other two helicopters who were in the convoy with the president of Iran [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  searched, according to the executive vice president, those helicopters then searched [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=62.779999999999994s)]
*  for the one that had hit the ground. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=67.38s)]
*  And at this point, we don't have any additional information about whether they were able to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=70.66s)]
*  locate that helicopter or what happened with those other two helicopters. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  But we are hearing from the head of the Red Crescent in Iran, which is essentially their [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=79.32s)]
*  equivalent of the Red Cross. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=84.14s)]
*  They say that they are approaching the site that they believe is the site of this incident. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=86.1s)]
*  So if they are able to reach that site, potentially we could start to know more in the coming [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=91.5s)]
*  minutes and hours, Alex. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, let's go over who was on board. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=97.46s)]
*  I have a list of those. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=99.94s)]
*  We don't know the numbers, although if you have the numbers of people on board, this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  one particular helicopter that's gone down in this convoy, I'd love to hear it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=104.6s)]
*  But this particular helicopter reportedly had President Raisi, had the foreign minister, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=109.02s)]
*  Hussein Amir Abdullahi, East Azerbaijan governor as well, the Friday prayers leader of Tabriz [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=114.62s)]
*  city, several other passengers. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=121.18s)]
*  Again, we don't know the complete number of passengers, but clearly there was a level [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=124.98s)]
*  of leadership on board this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=129.82s)]
*  And you say that it is the executive vice president who's been speaking on Iranian state [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=133.18s)]
*  TV. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=139.02s)]
*  Again, reiterate, two people have been contacted, but is he given anything more about their [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=141.18s)]
*  conditions, not necessarily names, but do we know if those people are okay? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=148.18s)]
*  Was there any description offered beyond that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=153.3s)]
*  No description. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=157.74s)]
*  Really, the only thing that we can infer, Alex, is the fact that they were able to speak [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=158.74s)]
*  by phone with the authorities indicates that they're still alive and at least conscious. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=162.98s)]
*  But beyond that, we don't have any information. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=169.9s)]
*  But we should point out this executive vice president, he is actually the figure who, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  if it turned out that President Raisi were dead, which we don't know that at this point, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  but if that were to be the case, it's the vice president who would actually take over [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  according to Iran's constitution and then would have to call for an election within [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  50 days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=188.82000000000002s)]
*  And so this is clearly a key figure who is going to be involved and responsible for the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=189.82000000000002s)]
*  continuity of government in the coming days as we work out exactly what's happened to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=194.86s)]
*  the president, the foreign minister, these key leaders in Iran's government. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=199.74s)]
*  Okay, Josh, I know you're staying on it, bringing us the very latest in all this transcribing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  actually happening on Iranian state TV just in the last few minutes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=208.46s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCFh5hsEG8&t=211.82000000000002s)]
