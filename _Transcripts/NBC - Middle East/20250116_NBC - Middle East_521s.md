# 'Two-state solution' would be 'huge mistake': Ex-Israeli PM on future of Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs)
*  former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Prime Minister, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=0.0s)]
*  And thank you. I'm happy we had you available right at the top here to go to. I believe we had you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=4.32s)]
*  There you are. Thank you for being there for us. All right. Let's talk about the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=12.08s)]
*  hiccups in this ceasefire deal. As I understand it, the Israeli cabinet is meeting at 7 a.m. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  tomorrow. What do you understand is going on? It's going to pass. There's obviously [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=22.32s)]
*  considerable resistance and debate in Israel regarding the deal. Many feel that it's a vital [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=29.52s)]
*  deal that we're bringing home hostages. But on the other hand, many oppose it because it leaves [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=37.6s)]
*  two thirds of the hostages in Hamas's hands and it keeps Hamas up and alive. So it's a highly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=44.4s)]
*  debated deal, though a majority of Israelis support it. It will pass in the vote in the cabinet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  There's a big majority. Do you think doing a phased deal is a good idea given all of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=58.72s)]
*  tensions, all of the ways that this could go wrong? Generally, I would think that a much better [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=64.24s)]
*  approach would be all of the hostages. It's tremendously problematic to keep two thirds [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=72.24s)]
*  of the hostages in Hamas's hands. But we are where we are. And I want to second guess my own [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=80.24s)]
*  government. But I will say that earlier today, I met families of the hostages and they were amazing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=87.04s)]
*  because even families that their member is supposed to be released in this deal said that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  they feel terrible that many others are going to stay in captivity of Hamas. And that's the type [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  of solidarity that makes me proud to be Israeli. The former Israeli ambassador to the United States, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  Michael Oren, says that this is a bad deal, but it's a deal that we have to take because of the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=115.68s)]
*  failures of October 7th. What do you think of that? Look, I think factually the government [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  set three objectives, which is to beat Hamas militarily, replace Hamas on a civilian layer [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=130.32s)]
*  and bring home all the hostages. Factually, we've not met those objectives, any of them, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=138.0s)]
*  as of yet. That's a fact and we're 14 months in. Are there better ways to have handled the whole [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=143.44s)]
*  thing? Perhaps. But we are where we are. And my main message is that Israelis are united in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=150.56s)]
*  embracing the hostages and looking to ensure that all the hostages will be brought home. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=158.8s)]
*  Ultimately, we have to be able to replace Hamas. We cannot allow Hamas to be left standing up [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=166.56s)]
*  after what they did because they are saying right now that they're going to do it again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=174.56s)]
*  There were images of Hamas celebrating in the streets of Gaza yesterday. I'm sure you saw them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=179.92s)]
*  Hamas has not been eradicated. Secretary Blinken here in the United States said that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=187.04s)]
*  there's been three Hamas recruits for every one that Israel has been able to kill. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=191.6s)]
*  Was this war successful? You know, we had to go to war to remove Hamas. I see those celebrations. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=198.4s)]
*  I'm not impressed by those celebrations. They are celebrating a cult of death. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=205.44s)]
*  We in Israel celebrate life and life will prevail. Make no mistake, these people who are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  right now chanting Yaya Sinwar and we're going to do October 7th again, that is not the way forward. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=218.88s)]
*  We will fight them as much as we need until we win. Again, tactically, things could be done [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=226.16s)]
*  differently, better, and ultimately they will be done better and we will win. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=235.12s)]
*  Do you think Israel is safer today than it was after October 7th? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=240.64s)]
*  Yes, many of Hamas's abilities, Hezbollah's abilities have been dramatically reduced, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=245.6s)]
*  but have we achieved the objectives that the three objectives that the government set? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=254.88s)]
*  No, we haven't. I got to be honest and I think we have to prosecute the war, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=259.2s)]
*  conduct the war in a much more effective way. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=264.56s)]
*  The two-state solution is still the thing that the Americans are holding on to. They want to see it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=268.4s)]
*  It's not something that I think you can argue that the Palestinians want. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=274.72s)]
*  They think they want one state, a Palestinian state. It's not something that the Israelis want. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  They want one state, they want an Israeli state. Is a two-state solution ever going to be possible? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=281.92s)]
*  And if so, do you think there's ever going to be a time where, or is there a leader out there that can [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  unite the Israelis? And then is there a leader that can unite the Palestinians to try to co-exist peacefully? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=293.36s)]
*  You know, the Palestinians had a state in Gaza. They had an independent state. There was no siege [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=299.12s)]
*  at the beginning, nothing. We handed all of Gaza over to the Palestinians and said, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  go build yourselves a life. And that was in 2005. And instead, what they did, they built a terror [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=311.36s)]
*  nation. They built tunnels and rockets and missiles in order to kill as many Jews as possible. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what they did with billions of dollars. So to think that we should now try this again [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  in a bigger scope in Judea and Samaria, that would be a vast mistake, a huge mistake for the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  state of Israel. We don't want to govern the Palestinians. I don't want to govern the Palestinians. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=343.12s)]
*  They should have their own autonomy, their own entity. But a full-blown state that would [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  again threaten Israel, that's not going to work. And a vast majority of Israelis do not agree to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=352.8s)]
*  that anymore. Will there ever be a lasting peace, not just a, you know, no violence, but a lasting [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=358.72s)]
*  peace between Palestinians and Israelis without a two-state solution? Do you think that Palestinians [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=363.36s)]
*  in Gaza or the West Bank will ever be fully satisfied, enough to not try to wage war or [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  to commit acts of violence as resistance if they don't have their own full-scale autonomy? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  You see, but the fact is that they're not seeking the state. They had one in their hands and they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=383.6s)]
*  turned it into a terror state. In Gaza, they governed themselves, had their own elections, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=388.88000000000005s)]
*  their own government, their own everything. And they immediately, after we disengaged from there, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=393.44000000000005s)]
*  they turned it into a terror state. So unfortunately, they are not seeking a state [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  aside a Jewish state. They are seeking to remove the entire Jewish state. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=406.24s)]
*  In our case, we do want others to live with respect and dignity [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=410.4s)]
*  besides us. We're not trying to kill them or annihilate them. They're trying to do it to us. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  We will not let them do that again. That's our big lesson from October 7th. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  What is your vision for the day after? If you were in charge, what would you be proposing? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  What I would do ultimately is the following. In Gaza, I would ensure that for the foreseeable [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=432.0s)]
*  future, Israel does not govern Gaza's life. They would have their own government of moderate Arab [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=438.96s)]
*  states, for example, Egypt and the Emirates and the Saudis. We would be responsible for security [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=446.64s)]
*  and have a perimeter surrounding Gaza, in Gaza, so they can't attack us again the way they did. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=454.24s)]
*  If they would govern themselves, we don't want to govern them, but we have to retain [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=461.76s)]
*  security control. I would do this ASAP because I don't want to be governing them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=465.44s)]
*  Do you think Netanyahu can maintain his coalition? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=471.12s)]
*  I don't know. I think the question is the future of Israel. The future of Israel means that we [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=475.28s)]
*  have to eradicate Hamas and we have to bring the 100 hostages home. We just have to do that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=481.44s)]
*  Those are the objectives that the government itself set and we have to meet them. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=488.72s)]
*  Do you have a good idea of how many of them are still alive? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=493.84s)]
*  I don't want to talk about the numbers that have been floating around. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  Some of them have been executed, unfortunately, and many of them are still alive and we're fighting [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=502.8s)]
*  for each of them and praying that they'll come home safely. Naftali Bennett, former Prime Minister [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=508.8s)]
*  of Israel, thank you so much for joining us and thank you for being ready for us right at the top [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  of the show when we need to do. Thank you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPtyc5jHJs&t=519.44s)]
