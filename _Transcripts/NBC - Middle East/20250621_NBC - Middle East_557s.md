# ‘Can’t guarantee anything in combat’: Retired Lt. Gen. warns against long U.S. involvement in Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY)
*  Cori, you've worked on nuclear nonproliferation for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=0.0s)]
*  So first, does it surprise you the president is not just breaking with his own intelligence [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=4.2s)]
*  agencies, but reportedly sidelining his intelligence director and defense secretary? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is a little bit surprising in general. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=15.08s)]
*  I think that the president is well informed in, you know, the presidency is well informed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  by the scope, the broad scope of the intelligence community. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=25.72s)]
*  Right now, we're really seeing a gap between descriptions of a nuclear weapons program [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=29.44s)]
*  and a nuclear weapons capability. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=34.2s)]
*  And I think that's where there is some divide in the political community. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=36.44s)]
*  Certainly, Iran has been increasing its nuclear weapons capability, kind of putting all the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=41.8s)]
*  pieces in place if they were to make that decision to go for a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=48.24s)]
*  I think where there's a little bit more debate is have they made that decision? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=53.0s)]
*  Has there been instruction from the top that the supreme leader had instructed his experts [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=57.08s)]
*  to build a nuclear weapon? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=64.48s)]
*  And that's where we've seen the intelligence community be pretty consistent that while [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=66.16s)]
*  some of the earlier steps may be increasing, the decision had not yet been made. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=69.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=74.32s)]
*  I want to also ask you about your Carnegie colleague, that's James Acton, who says, we [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=75.32s)]
*  can't bomb our way out of this, noting that Iran could almost certainly reconstitute its [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  nuclear program within about 10 or 15 years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=84.08s)]
*  And a week ago, we had the president appearing more interested in diplomacy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=87.0s)]
*  Is there a strategic advantage, Cori, to bombing Iran at this time? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Or do you think a U.S. attack would motivate Iran to push harder to build a nuclear weapon [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  that to your point may not necessarily have been greenlit? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  And I'm also curious the role you see Israel playing in all this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think what James's key point in his opinion piece, which I really reinforce, is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  that we sometimes hold military action to a different standard as diplomatic action. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=114.96s)]
*  He was right to point this out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  The criticism of the diplomatic solution, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  was concluded in 2015, was that it wasn't a forever solution. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=127.0s)]
*  It just put on pause their ability to expand their nuclear capability. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=131.32s)]
*  Well, we should be asking ourselves, does military action do the same thing? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=136.84s)]
*  Is this just kicking the can down the road and in fact reinforcing those voices, of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=141.28s)]
*  which I believe there are many within the Iranian system that would say we cannot leave [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=146.88s)]
*  ourselves vulnerable to these kinds of attacks from Israel, from the West, and the only guarantor [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=151.68s)]
*  we would really have is a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=157.36s)]
*  So if there is the intention of the United States to get involved, I would hope they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=159.52s)]
*  have an end game. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=163.72s)]
*  And I haven't seen what that is yet. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=164.72s)]
*  I still think that a resumption of diplomatic engagement, while no guarantee of an outcome, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=166.24s)]
*  at least gives us a chance to see if we can pause the program again, but importantly pause [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=172.24s)]
*  it while we have verification and monitoring on the ground. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=178.4s)]
*  That's what we had before and that's what we've lost. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  General Twitty knows all about end games, sir. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you agree with this assessment? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=186.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=188.72s)]
*  We should always exhaust all diplomatic means before we introduce our military instrument [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  of power into combat. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=196.48s)]
*  If you think about the risks associated with any particular operation having to do militarily [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=198.56s)]
*  with Iran, we have 40,000 United States soldiers that are our service members that are stationed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=206.32s)]
*  in the region that we could put in harm's way if we attack. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=213.14s)]
*  We could also put ourselves in a protracted war with Iran. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=217.12s)]
*  You know, we've been there before in the Middle East with Iraq. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=223.56s)]
*  We don't want to go that route again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=227.36s)]
*  The Iranians could shut down the Strait of Hormuz and that would significantly impact [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=229.94s)]
*  global economy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=237.0s)]
*  So there are all kinds of risks that we need to make sure that we put the diplomatic effort [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=238.26s)]
*  first before we introduce the military. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=245.08s)]
*  General, I want to focus on one particular action and that would be relative to what [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=247.48s)]
*  the New York Times is reporting that Trump is seriously considering sending American [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  aircraft to help refuel Israeli combat jets and then of course to bomb Iran's deep underground [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=255.56s)]
*  nuclear site at Fordow. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=262.72s)]
*  That would be with this 30,000 pound bunker buster of which the United States is the only [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=264.72s)]
*  one that's able to do that and has the capability. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=268.52s)]
*  So what is involved in this kind of military action? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=272.0s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=275.04s)]
*  Yeah, very complex operation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=276.56s)]
*  Of course, we've been studying Fordow now for years. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=279.48s)]
*  It used to be an old RRG military base. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=283.2s)]
*  Now it's transitioned obviously into a nuclear facility. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=288.18s)]
*  We have a lot of intelligence. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=291.84s)]
*  We know it's in the mountains. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=293.48s)]
*  We know it's heavily fortified. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=295.0s)]
*  We know that the nuclear facility is about 300 feet below ground. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=296.92s)]
*  So it's going to take probably the B-2 bomber that would be the main effort here, supported [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  by U.S. fighter jets, supported by AWACS capability that gives command and control in the air, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=309.76s)]
*  and supported by exquisite intelligence. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=318.76s)]
*  We would have to do a quick strike, making a battle damage assessment, strike again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=323.52s)]
*  It may take a couple of strikes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  The good thing about it is there's air superiority. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=330.64s)]
*  The Israelis have taken out most of the Iran's air defense capabilities. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  But I would not be looking for regime change if we want to make sure we get in and out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=341.2s)]
*  You strike, make the battle damage assessment. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  You don't have to necessarily get 300 feet. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=350.14s)]
*  If you can close the entry and exit ways in some type of permanent way, then I would call [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=354.5s)]
*  that success and then move out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=360.7s)]
*  Now, the difficult part is this is a retaliatory strike. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=364.34s)]
*  You anticipate another question because what is the guarantee that it's a one-and-done [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=369.78s)]
*  That there is not further military back and forth that draws the United States into something [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=375.54s)]
*  that many people don't want it to be drawn into. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=380.98s)]
*  How can you guarantee the mentality? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=384.54s)]
*  Is it just the point you made that the United States has done some refueling perhaps, but [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=387.1s)]
*  Israel has done a pretty successful job of eliminating Iran's ability to strike from [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=392.22s)]
*  the air, right, except for drones and things like that and missiles? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  Is that the only guarantee you would have that this wouldn't go any further? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=403.98s)]
*  So you can't guarantee anything in combat. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=409.22s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time in combat and nothing is guaranteed. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=411.86s)]
*  And it's just like Mike Tyson says, you know, you strike first and be prepared for the next [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=416.3s)]
*  punch and you may get knocked out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=422.86s)]
*  And so we would go in there with a full suite of combat capability. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=425.18s)]
*  Remember, we also have the USS Nimitz in the Med with other strike capabilities that we [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=431.29999999999995s)]
*  can bring to the table as well. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=439.02s)]
*  So this thing could escalate because you never know if we go in there and then we open up [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=440.7s)]
*  a harness nest, then you have to be prepared. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=446.65999999999997s)]
*  And so the CENTCOM commander, General Eric Carilla, he's got some plans on the table [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=449.58s)]
*  that if they strike hard, then we can strike even harder. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=456.18s)]
*  We should note there are about 40,000 troops along with naval, army and air bases [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=461.62s)]
*  scattered in this region. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=464.94s)]
*  Final word to you, Corey, what is your biggest fear about what comes next that may lead to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=466.14s)]
*  more down the road? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=472.7s)]
*  Well, I think there are two specific actions that would cause me real concern. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=475.22s)]
*  One is we saw a few days ago a mistaken report that Israel had attacked the Bushir [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  nuclear power plant. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=485.74s)]
*  The nuclear and radiological risk of most of the sites that they've been targeting is [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=487.18s)]
*  quite low because these are in the end kind of industrial sites. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=492.38s)]
*  They're not really nuclear sites in the sense of having that really highly radioactive [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  material on site. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  Bushir is different. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=502.7s)]
*  So if Israel were to on purpose or by some mistake hit the Bushir nuclear power plants, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=503.82s)]
*  that could be extremely dangerous for the region. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=511.18s)]
*  The other thing I worry about, frankly, is just the idea that this is driving Iran to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=513.82s)]
*  the decision we don't want them to take. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=518.6600000000001s)]
*  And I think that we need to take it very seriously that while we are never going to like [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=520.86s)]
*  the outcome of a civil nuclear program in Iran, a civil program under a strong monitoring [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=526.62s)]
*  is going to be more safe than a militarized nuclear weapons program. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrobnbYTbY&t=533.3000000000001s)]
