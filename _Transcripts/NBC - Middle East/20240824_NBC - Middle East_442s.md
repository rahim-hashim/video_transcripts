Video Description: The Uncommitted movement represents the at least 700,000 individuals who cast protest votes against Joe Biden during the presidential primary to demand a ceasefire in Gaza. They hoped that at the DNC, just one of the many Palestinian speakers they proposed would be allowed to give a speech on the main stage. Not a single Palestinian American was given a speaking slot on the convention stage all week. Instead, Georgia State Representative Ruwa Romman gave a speech outside the convention center. “We all wanted to come to a place of unity and a place of ‘yes’,” says Rep. Romman. “I don't really know where to go from here, to be quite honest.”

# 'We all wanted to come to a place of unity': Palestinian Americans denied a spot on DNC stage
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM)
*  The Georgia State representative Ruah Roman joins me now. Representative Roman, good to see you again. Thank you for joining us today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=0.0s)]
*  Before you delivered that speech outside, you added a note about what the speech was intended to do, and you were talking about the fact that you fully understand, as do, I don't know, I don't want to represent people uncommitted to what they think. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=7.0s)]
*  But you certainly are of the belief that electing Kamala Harris isn't imperative, but you wanted your message out there. Tell me a little bit about that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, so first and foremost, thank you so much for having me. And to be clear, I was not a delegate. I went to Chicago for a panel with American Institute and a couple of other events and was supposed to actually come home, I think, either Thursday or Wednesday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=32.0s)]
*  But I loved what Uncommitted has been doing since December. What they've done is they have kept our community that has been full of so much despair engaged in the process and teaching them how to use these levers to get the policy decisions that they wanted. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=49.0s)]
*  That's why I support them. That's why I've been working with them. We all wanted to come to a place of unity and a place of yes. We were willing to work in good faith. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=63.0s)]
*  We were willing to work in good faith. We wanted to be able to say, look, we showed you how many people care about this. We told you that this is going to be a problem come November. Please listen to us. And we are willing to even accept just a symbolic gesture of a singular Palestinian. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=71.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter who it is, a singular Palestinian couple of minutes on the stage, and it would go such a long way for our communities. You are somebody you are a Democrat because I've gotten tweets from people this morning saying they didn't they weren't represented because they're not Democrats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=86.0s)]
*  You're a Democrat. You actually are involved in getting people to come out and vote. You are you are an example of someone who was not deeply involved in American politics. You went to get involved. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=100.0s)]
*  As I recall, the story was great about how someone sort of misunderstood you to say that you were running for office and published a story and all of a sudden you were off to the races. And now you are a state representative. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=110.0s)]
*  You're not looking to rip down the Democratic Party. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=120.0s)]
*  No, I mean, I have been an organizer for 10 years. I've only been elected official for barely a full term. My goal and my passion and the thing that I care the most about truly and sincerely is civic engagement. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=125.0s)]
*  I want to teach regular average everyday people that they can have political influence. You don't have to be somebody who is, you know, fancy or with a specific pedigree to be able to make sure that your voice is heard in our political systems because frankly, the nihilism is just allowing this awful, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=136.0s)]
*  self-fulfilling prophecy and as more people disengage, sort of the worse the policies that we are seeing get. And I've been passionate about that for 10 years. I've been doing this for 10 years. And that's why I cared so much about bridging this divide because I did not want to keep losing so many people who are losing faith. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=153.0s)]
*  So much faith and despair about everything that is happening, including our elections. And yet when Carla Harris sort of became the the the heir apparent, the nominee, she did say things that were not a departure from Biden Harris policy, but they seem to be empathetic toward the needs of those people who continue to suffer in Gaza. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=169.0s)]
*  Tell me how, whether that offsets things at all. Is there a sense among people in the uncommitted movement that Kamala Harris does hear and understand the complaint? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I was incredibly honored to get an opportunity to speak with her briefly when she came to Atlanta. And I relate to her that our community, as soon as they heard that she would be our presumptive nominee, was cautiously optimistic. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=203.0s)]
*  They appreciated how much more empathetic she had been in her speech talking about the people of the Palestinians overall. It was incredibly powerful to be able to use that and say, rekindle that hope a little bit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=216.0s)]
*  The problem is that people still needed some form of assurance that the bombs are going to stop that are mass slaughtering their family members. And again, to be clear, the reason one of to be clear, the uncommitted had multiple asks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=229.0s)]
*  A speaker was one of those asked, but it was the bare minimum symbolic one. And it was meant to continue that spark of hope that we had seen. We are trying to not just keep it going, but grow it a little bit. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=242.0s)]
*  And, you know, to be quite honest, I'm not really sure where we go from here. There is a lot of anger and disappointment that there was not a single Palestinian speaker who got even just a couple of minutes on that stage. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=254.0s)]
*  Frankly, personally, for me, I'm from Georgia. I saw a Republican from Georgia on that stage who was anti-choice, passed an anti-trans bill, and I get the importance of building a large tent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=264.0s)]
*  I want to include as many people as possible in our party. But when that comes at the expense of other people who have been in this party for way longer and way more supportive, I don't know what to do with that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=276.0s)]
*  I really don't know how to work and bridge the gap that we have seen. So, you know, if I don't even know if they, you know, I don't really know where to go from here, to be quite honest. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=287.0s)]
*  Personally, does it change what you do? Because I know you've been involved in trying to get people to make sure they're registering to vote and show up on November 5th. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=297.0s)]
*  You have articulated something that many people have articulated that Donald Trump is a danger to everybody in this country on many levels. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=305.0s)]
*  Does it change your plan? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=313.0s)]
*  I mean, to be clear, I'm running for reelection. I have an opponent this year, so we are working hard. I actually just launched a canvas right before this to knock doors. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=318.0s)]
*  The reality is that things do not change at the federal level. And what I tell people is that while we can't win on all issues at the ballot box, we can at least make sure we don't lose. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=326.0s)]
*  And between elections, we apply pressure and particularly down ballot. Candidates like me who are state representatives are closer to your front door. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=335.0s)]
*  And so my commitment to that has not changed because I recognize that as we build infrastructure, we become sort of a force to be reckoned with, a coalition that cannot be ignored. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=343.0s)]
*  But it does require both short term and long term planning. You know, in terms of what's going to happen with the Harris campaign, I already had, you know, I originally had a plan to like endorse after the convention. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=353.0s)]
*  I even had saved a little form to become a surrogate. I don't know if they want that endorsement. I really do not know sort of what is going to happen next. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=363.0s)]
*  All I know is that right now I need to take some time to make sure that my community is OK, because understandably they're upset. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=372.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear when I say my community, I'm not just talking about Arabs. I'm not just talking about Palestinians. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=380.0s)]
*  The reason the reason this moment is so profound is because and like I said in my speech, it's a beautiful, multi faith, multi generational, multi racial coalition that emerged on this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=385.0s)]
*  It is the base of our party. I again was not supposed to be the convention. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=394.0s)]
*  But when I walked around McCormick, people were wearing these stoles that said Democrats for Palestinian rights. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=398.0s)]
*  They were wearing ceasefire pins. They were had little Palestinian flags. I mean, the base has moved on this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=403.0s)]
*  And for me personally, I'm not giving up on that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=408.0s)]
*  Representative Roman, great to call you that because that's what you are. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=411.0s)]
*  You're elected state representative from Georgia. Thank you for being on the show. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=416.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=420.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GCipUTUxRM&t=441.0s)]
