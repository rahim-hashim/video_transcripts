# U.S. officials confirm Iran launches drones toward Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM)
*  I want to bring in now NBC News chief international correspondent Richard Engel to talk more about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=0.0s)]
*  this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  He's on the ground for us in Jerusalem. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Take us there, Richard. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=6.84s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=8.46s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=9.46s)]
*  So, just a short while ago, we heard Israeli jets flying over the sky here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=10.46s)]
*  Air defenses have been intensified all across the—all across this country, all across [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=16.52s)]
*  the region. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned a short while ago that Jordan has closed its airspace. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli military has also issued directives for people to follow as this slow-motion attack [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=26.92s)]
*  is underway. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=34.52s)]
*  For the next 48 hours, all gatherings, over 1,000 people, have been banned. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=35.52s)]
*  There will be no school, no university, no daycare facilities. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=40.64s)]
*  The military went on camera and gave a statement telling people to take this threat seriously, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=45.24s)]
*  that drones have been launched, that they were launched from inside Iranian territory, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=51.8s)]
*  that they are on their way, but that they will take several hours to get here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=56.44s)]
*  It is roughly 700 miles between the Israeli border and the Iranian border. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Drones don't fly particularly quickly, so we don't know exactly when they are going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  to arrive, if they're not shot down ahead of time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  And it does seem quite possible that they could be shot down ahead of time because so [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=76.18s)]
*  much was anticipated about this attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=80.12s)]
*  President Biden knew it was coming. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=82.94s)]
*  The intelligence services in the United States across the region have been warning this kind [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=84.46s)]
*  of thing could be coming for the last several days, with those warnings becoming more and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=88.62s)]
*  more intense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=92.94s)]
*  But Israelis were told, take this seriously, go to the shelters, and we will inform you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=94.38s)]
*  if there are other attacks coming. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=100.22s)]
*  It is possible that these drones are only part of a larger coordinated attack, that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=103.18s)]
*  ballistic missiles also involved in this, or cruise missiles, which are harder to stop [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=109.22s)]
*  than the slow-moving drones. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=114.06s)]
*  But for now, that is where we are here in Israel, here in Jerusalem, where this slow-motion [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=116.58s)]
*  attack is underway, and Israelis are being told to stay calm, be vigilant, but follow [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=123.82s)]
*  instructions as these explosive-laden drones get closer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=129.22s)]
*  I'm hearing traffic in the background. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=135.62s)]
*  I'm hearing horns honking, Richard. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=137.46s)]
*  But I'm wondering if you've kind of sensed at all a temperature change, and I don't mean [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=139.1s)]
*  hot to cold, but more a temperature change amongst the Israeli people with the launching [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=142.78s)]
*  of these drones. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=147.58s)]
*  No. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=149.78s)]
*  You do not sense that this country is in panic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=152.02s)]
*  There are some cars out on the streets. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=155.2s)]
*  Earlier tonight, there was a demonstration in Tel Aviv against Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=157.26s)]
*  who people hear, the demonstrators feel, is not handling the war correctly, is putting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=163.34s)]
*  his own personal career ahead of the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  They were out on the streets despite these warnings. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=171.98s)]
*  We believe that this is happening right now, but there was a threat that this could happen [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=176.5s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=181.04s)]
*  So Israel has been on edge that this reprisal could be coming for the last, say, 48 to 72 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  hours. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  People have been out on the street. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  People have been going about their business, going to restaurants. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=192.34s)]
*  But right now, the Israeli military is telling people, do not take this lightly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=195.06s)]
*  Take this very seriously. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=201.18s)]
*  It's going to take several more hours for these drones to arrive. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=202.18s)]
*  There are also now reports on the Israeli media that we're still working to confirm [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=205.94s)]
*  that another wave has potentially been launched. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=210.3s)]
*  So this is still very much a developing situation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=213.62s)]
*  So for now, I think the country is tense, but the streets have not cleared out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=216.56s)]
*  We've been talking a lot about Iran's proxies and how they have been continuous in their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=224.76s)]
*  assault on Israel throughout the Israeli-Gaza war. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=230.28s)]
*  And Aaron David Miller talked about how if Iran wanted to hit Israel directly, he would [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=235.56s)]
*  have gotten his bullet to do it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=240.84s)]
*  And instead, they're going about it this way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=243.54s)]
*  Talk us through, Richard, if you will, some of what we've seen from Iran's proxies leading [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=245.36s)]
*  up to this moment. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it was Ben Rhodes you had on earlier said the key to watch is, is this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=253.10000000000002s)]
*  it? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=257.48s)]
*  Is this the finality of Iran's response to the attack on its embassy compound in Damascus [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=258.48s)]
*  two weeks ago that killed seven Iranians from the Revolutionary Guard, including a very [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=264.5s)]
*  senior general from the Quds Force, which is their external wing that is responsible [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  for carrying out attacks by Hezbollah, by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=274.44s)]
*  And if it is, then it seems like this could easily be contained because slow moving drones [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=280.08s)]
*  that the Israelis see almost as soon as they are launched, they see them with American [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=287.2s)]
*  support. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  The U.S. military has been helping them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  That is a sign that there could be a sign that Israel, that Iran doesn't want to escalate [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=296.32s)]
*  this any further. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  But we do not know yet. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=302.34s)]
*  The drones, according to the Israelis, are still in the sky, still on their way here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=304.48s)]
*  Their potential, a potential of a second wave. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  And we really don't know if there will be other attacks that could be involved. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=311.9s)]
*  Are these diversionary attacks, are there ballistic missiles? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=315.38s)]
*  I think we're going to learn a lot more about what Iran's intentions are on how it plans [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=317.9s)]
*  to respond to the attack two weeks ago in Damascus as this unfolds between now and potentially [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=323.02s)]
*  daybreak tomorrow here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=328.84s)]
*  So Richard, I've reported both in Israel and Iran. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=331.62s)]
*  And when I saw the news come through that Iran had launched this attack, I got the chills [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=334.18s)]
*  because of the unprecedented moment we are potentially at, a direct conflict between [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=339.46s)]
*  Iran and Israel. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=344.54s)]
*  And we don't know, as you mentioned, and as all of my other panelists have talked about, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=345.54s)]
*  what will come next. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=349.32s)]
*  But the potential of what could become is incredible, really, to think about this direct [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=351.2s)]
*  Iran on Israel conflict. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=356.9s)]
*  Well, the Israeli foreign minister has already said that if an attack is launched from Iranian [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=360.62s)]
*  territory and hits Israeli territory, then Israel will respond by attacking Iranian soil. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=366.66s)]
*  Iran has already said, the Iran supreme leader, that it believed the attack on the consular [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=373.42s)]
*  annex at its embassy in Damascus two weeks ago was an attack on Iranian soil. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=378.74s)]
*  So we're talking that language already, where the two countries are discussing direct assaults [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=385.86s)]
*  on each other, not through proxies. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  So it would be a new phase of this conflict. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=394.72s)]
*  For the last six months, Iran has been attacking Israel, and Israel has been attacking Iran, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=397.38s)]
*  but going through the proxies, including Hezbollah and, of course, Hamas, which is supported [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=404.26s)]
*  by Iran. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubIULkk4QM&t=409.16s)]
