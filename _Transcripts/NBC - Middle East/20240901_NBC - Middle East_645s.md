# ‘I really believed he would be released:’ Israeli-American among six hostages found dead in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ)
*  We are back with our breaking news coverage of the six hostages found dead in Gaza by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli defense forces. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Now, according to the Israeli Defense Force, the hostages are believed to have been killed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  shortly before they were found. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=12.18s)]
*  Joining us now is Jeremy Bash, former chief of staff at the CIA and the Department of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=14.88s)]
*  Defense. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=18.96s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you for getting up early with us this morning on this breaking news. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=19.96s)]
*  I want to go to this point that we know. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=24.44s)]
*  We know from the Israeli media, given autopsies, that the hostages, the bodies that were recovered, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=26.28s)]
*  were shortly were killed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=34.28s)]
*  The people were killed shortly before the troops got to them, the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=36.28s)]
*  which as Michael and I were just discussing in the break, suggest that they were killed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=41.92s)]
*  intentionally because Hamas knew they were coming to be rescued. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=45.08s)]
*  What kind of conversations are happening now, do you think, given your experience within [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=53.16s)]
*  the federal government? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, CIA Director Burns has been lead on the negotiations for the ceasefire in consultation [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  with Secretary Blinken, the president, vice president, so on and so forth. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  But does this complicate the matter here? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=68.96s)]
*  And are they working to gather more information, you think, given your experience? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=72.16s)]
*  Well, Simone and Michael, first of all, we have to say we are heartbroken because this [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=76.12s)]
*  American hostage, Hirsch Goldberg-Poland, is an American citizen who was attending a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=81.2s)]
*  music festival just like any American youth today would be attending a soccer tournament [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=86.08s)]
*  or a back-to-school barbecue when he was taken by terrorists. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=91.76s)]
*  His arm was blown off. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=96.68s)]
*  He managed to somehow survive that gruesome wound, and he survived 11 months in captivity. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=98.12s)]
*  His parents, John Poland and Rachel Goldberg-Poland, who I know personally, who so many have worked [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=103.76s)]
*  with, they've been advocates on the world stage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=110.56s)]
*  They've met with President Biden. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=113.32s)]
*  They met with Vice President Harris. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=114.6s)]
*  They've met with world leaders, the pope, leaders from around the world to basically [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  plead, please let these hostages go. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=120.88s)]
*  And Hamas could end this right now by letting these nearly 100 hostages go. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  To answer your question directly, Simone, I think it's full steam ahead to try to get a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=128.6s)]
*  ceasefire deal. I don't think any discovery of additional hostages who have been murdered by [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=132.76s)]
*  Hamas really changes the equation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=137.64s)]
*  The United States wants a ceasefire. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=140.2s)]
*  We want the hostages released, all of them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=142.76s)]
*  There are still seven American hostages unaccounted for, for who we believe are living. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=146.88s)]
*  But for Hamas to brutally murder an American hostage in cold blood, just as we are negotiating [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=153.28s)]
*  their release, just shows you the depravity of that organization's ideology and their tactics. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=160.2s)]
*  Jeremy, you know, right at this point, to Simone's question, that there are a lot of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=165.48s)]
*  efforts that are underway within the West Wing Situation Room, looking at this, of course, the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=170.36s)]
*  State Department and other governmental organs, as you know, as they're trying to gather that, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=175.76s)]
*  the president's put out a very forceful statement, obviously, to condemn these killings. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=182.44s)]
*  Hamas has responded to this hostage crisis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=187.44s)]
*  Dr. Basim Naim, member of the Political Bureau of Hamas in Gaza, noted, quote, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=193.36s)]
*  If President Biden is concerned with protecting human life, regardless of his national [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=198.88s)]
*  nationality or religion, he must exercise his powers and use his tools to stop the aggression [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=202.8s)]
*  immediately and force Netanyahu and his fascist government to sign a ceasefire, which he seeks [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=208.28s)]
*  to disrupt every time, either by committing horrific massacres or adding new conditions. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  They're the ones who just killed six individuals because, as Simone noted, they were about to be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=219.28s)]
*  rescued. How do these actions complicate this effort towards a ceasefire, which, to be honest, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=224.72s)]
*  has been languishing back and forth between, you know, Israel and Hamas and the U.S. trying to push [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=232.32s)]
*  this ball forward? What next steps can be taken given the complication of this hard, hard no [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=241.04s)]
*  stance in the face of these killings, as well as the effort to try to rescue the remaining hostages? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=249.12s)]
*  Well, an event like this makes it even more urgent to get the rest of the hostages out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=256.96s)]
*  And I think that will require everybody from President Biden to Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=263.44s)]
*  to the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and anybody who has influence over Hamas to redouble, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=268.88s)]
*  re-triple their efforts to get these hostages out, including the seven Americans who remain. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=276.56s)]
*  But look, I think it does in some ways bolster Netanyahu's argument that these are terrorists, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=282.64s)]
*  they're going to kill our people in cold blood, and so we can't really negotiate with them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=287.92s)]
*  And just as we're about to put our hands on them and rescue them, whether through a negotiation or [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  through a special operations raid, they're going to put a bullet in the back of the head of these [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=297.44s)]
*  terrorists. And so in some ways, it bolsters Bibi Netanyahu's argument that Israel must combat Hamas [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=300.88s)]
*  and destroy it militarily and put more military pressure on Hamas. On the other hand, I think it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=307.12s)]
*  does also make more urgent the effort to get out any innocent captives who can be released. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=312.88s)]
*  You know, I have to just say personally, I've been working with John Pollan and Rachel Goldberg-Pollan, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=320.96s)]
*  the parents of Hirsch, the American who was murdered. And, you know, I really believed, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=326.4s)]
*  I really believed in my heart of hearts that this was going to have a happy ending. I believed he [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=331.76s)]
*  was going to be released. There were so many efforts underway, so many people of goodwill [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  across the world, including from the Arab, from the Palestinian, from the Muslim world, who actually [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  came to us and said that they wanted to work on the release of hostages. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  And I really believed he was going to be reunited with his parents, with his two sisters, with his [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=352.24s)]
*  loving family, and with all of his friends. And I'm just absolutely heartbroken, devastated [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=357.68s)]
*  that that's not going to happen for him and his family. But we cannot rest because there are still [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  100 hostages who are being held, including seven Americans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=369.12s)]
*  Hi, Jeremy. This is a part of the statement from President Biden released late last night. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=374.0s)]
*  President Biden notes, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=379.44s)]
*  It is as tragic as it is reprehensible. Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=381.52s)]
*  and we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=387.6s)]
*  of the remaining hostages. I will note, it seems that Hamas responded to the president on hostages [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=391.36s)]
*  with a statement of their own noting, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=398.16s)]
*  If President Biden is concerned with protecting human life, regardless of his nationality or [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  religion, he must exercise his powers and use his tools to stop the aggression immediately [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  and force Netanyahu and his fascist government to sign a ceasefire, which he seeks to disrupt [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=410.16s)]
*  every time, either by committing horrific massacres or adding new conditions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=414.88s)]
*  The statement from Hamas, obviously reprehensible given that they executed, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=418.72s)]
*  reportedly, it seems as though these people who literally were living their lives and have been [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=424.0s)]
*  abducted and taken into captivity, you've been working with the family. Have you spoken to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=432.16s)]
*  John and Rachel late last night, this morning? And if so, what can you tell us about how they're doing? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=441.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, Simone, thank you for saying that that statement is reprehensible, because it is. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=449.04s)]
*  And I did speak to John and Rachel yesterday morning. Actually, I have to say even as early [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=455.52s)]
*  as yesterday morning, Saturday morning, they were still working different angles, opportunities, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=461.76s)]
*  points of leverage, including with U.S. government officials, to see how they could get their loved [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  one, Hirsch, as well as the other hostages released. And it was only late in the afternoon [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=474.8s)]
*  that I reached out to them and they did confirm to me, Rachel confirmed to me that they were [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=481.44000000000005s)]
*  waiting to hear about the identification of certain remains that the IDF identified. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  And she just said one word to me. She just said, pray. And of course, that's what I did [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=493.12s)]
*  all night long. And then about 11, 15 p.m., late last night, Eastern time, she sent one line to me [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=498.08s)]
*  by text, which is Hebrew. It said, Baruch Dayan Ha'emet, which is, blessed are you, O Lord, who is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=507.28s)]
*  the Judger of Truth. And that's the statement that people say to each other when they've heard the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=514.72s)]
*  news of somebody passing. And so she was saying to me that her beloved Hirsch had passed. And [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=520.96s)]
*  I don't need to tell anybody here. Everybody can imagine themselves in the situation of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=528.32s)]
*  seeing their own child abducted, surviving devastating wounds and being held in tunnels [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=534.64s)]
*  at gunpoint for 11 months, starved, tortured, beaten and working around the clock. Because, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=542.32s)]
*  of course, it wouldn't defy the laws of physics to release this person. It's just the fact [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=548.08s)]
*  that evil people were holding him, evil people who were not being held accountable by the world [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=552.2399999999999s)]
*  community, by powers in the world, whether they were from the United States, Israel, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=559.28s)]
*  the Arab and Muslim world, they were not being held accountable. And they could have released him [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=565.28s)]
*  any moment in the last 11 months, and they did not. And so this is a time, a bit to mourn. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=572.88s)]
*  It's a time to hug your loved one, a time to know that you can't take for granted anybody's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=579.68s)]
*  safety or security. There are terrorists in the world who will abduct, who will kill, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=584.64s)]
*  who will bomb, who will destroy. And I think it's a time for the United States and our allies and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=590.16s)]
*  partners to close ranks and take the fight to terrorists and redouble our efforts to get these [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=596.0s)]
*  hostages out and create security and peace for all people, Israelis, Palestinians and people [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=600.16s)]
*  all around the world. Well said, Jeremy Bash. Thank you very, very much for your time this morning. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=606.64s)]
*  And our hearts absolutely go out to all of the families, especially John and Rachel in this time. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=614.88s)]
*  We will be right back, folks. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBicCY0c8kQ&t=623.36s)]
