# ‘Whole world’ was ‘denying and believing’ Assad regime’s lies: Woman who fled Syria
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg)
*  And joining us now is Razan Rashidi, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=0.0s)]
*  director of the Syria Campaign, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=2.24s)]
*  a human rights group based in Berlin. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=3.74s)]
*  Razan, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=6.44s)]
*  I know you were forced to leave your country, Syria, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=8.5s)]
*  in order to continue your work. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=10.88s)]
*  Much of your family, however, was not able to get out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=12.14s)]
*  It's just one family's life experience [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=15.38s)]
*  under the Assad dictatorship, but what was it like? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=18.82s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=23.88s)]
*  I think the state of fear, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=25.72s)]
*  this is how I would describe Syria. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=27.46s)]
*  I'm sure you are seeing all the footage as well [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=30.66s)]
*  from the dungeons of Assad, from Sadnaya prison. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=33.8s)]
*  But I think we need also to think of all the hospitals [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=37.96s)]
*  that were destroyed, of all the schools that were attacked, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=41.74s)]
*  the markets, and all the families that are, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=45.58s)]
*  you know, like the mother and the family of Austin Tice, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=48.58s)]
*  there are hundreds of thousands of Syrian families [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=51.64s)]
*  who are still looking for loved ones. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=54.58s)]
*  And I think Richard said it, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=58.18s)]
*  like I'm looking at the footage [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  from that security apparatus that he visited. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=61.66s)]
*  It looks for me like a five-star hotel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=65.22s)]
*  in comparison to the footage of the, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=67.7s)]
*  that I have seen where my own husband was, for example, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=71.64s)]
*  and the horror stories that he told me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=75.44s)]
*  I just wanna say one thing about the prisons in Syria, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=77.84s)]
*  being told to me by one of the detainees [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=81.84s)]
*  that all the photos we are seeing in the videos [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=84.96s)]
*  are the film set, but the horror film is not showing still. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  So even more than everything that we are seeing today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=92.34s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, for decades, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=96.78s)]
*  that regime denied any human rights violations existed, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=99.94s)]
*  and they said, no, there's no political prisons here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=103.88s)]
*  So many people, however, were tortured [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=107.42s)]
*  and killed in these prisons, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=109.62s)]
*  yet those people's stories were essentially made invisible [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=111.58s)]
*  by that authoritarian regime. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=115.84s)]
*  Is there now hope that their truth, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=117.62s)]
*  that their existence can be recognized? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=120.42s)]
*  I think this is exactly some of the things [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=124.12s)]
*  we work at the Syria campaign [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=126.26s)]
*  to make sure that victims and survivors stories [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=128.22s)]
*  are preserved, and the regime did not only commit [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=130.94s)]
*  those atrocities, but with the support of Russia [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=134.4s)]
*  and Iran and others have waged huge disinformation campaigns [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  to cover up its atrocities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  For example, on the use of chemical weapons, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=145.48s)]
*  many of the survivors would tell you, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=149.16s)]
*  we did not only survive and we have to deal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=151.72s)]
*  with the aftermath of living through that, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  but we're also living through the agony of denial, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=158.14s)]
*  because the whole world was denying [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=162.1s)]
*  and believing the Assad theory of fighting only terrorists [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=164.78s)]
*  or that we don't have political opposition. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=170.58s)]
*  And I think today, at least the world would see, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=173.56s)]
*  I would stress that we as human rights defenders, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=177.02s)]
*  and I would talk about my colleagues [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=181.22s)]
*  in victim and survivor groups, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=184.22s)]
*  those who survived Assad atrocities, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=186.34s)]
*  make sure the world know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=188.34s)]
*  We have seen horrific photos [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=189.84s)]
*  leaked by an ex-officer, Cesar Faians. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=192.34s)]
*  We've heard testimonies, horrific testimonies, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=197.1s)]
*  but sometimes I think it is important to say [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=201.1s)]
*  that the world knew about all of this and let it happen, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=203.9s)]
*  and I really hope that seeing all of those atrocities [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=207.54s)]
*  and evidence will end impunity to world crime, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=210.82s)]
*  not only in Syria, but everywhere. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=213.42s)]
*  And, Razan, you know, I've often thought about [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=216.9s)]
*  how countries can go from dictatorship to democracy [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  or to a better life, and I'm just thinking, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=225.44s)]
*  does Syria have what Portugal, for example, had in 1974, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  which is the international support [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=232.72s)]
*  of the Willy Branzas of the world [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  and the Mario Suarez's of Portugal in 1974? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=235.92s)]
*  Does Syria have what Spain had in 75 at the death of Franco? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=239.94s)]
*  Does it have a Felipe Gonzalez? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  Where is the future hope for your country? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=246.6s)]
*  I think this is the first time we've toppled a dictator, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=251.2s)]
*  so there's still a lot to learn, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=254.04s)]
*  but I would say the hope lies in Syria's civil society, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=256.2s)]
*  the people, the white helmets who've been saving, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=260.0s)]
*  you know, children from under the rubble, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=263.68s)]
*  women like myself, like others, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=265.8s)]
*  who believe in secular, free, and diverse Syria. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=268.56s)]
*  My hope is only with those people, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=273.08s)]
*  with the people that Richard is meeting today in Damascus, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  chanting for Syria, united and civic, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=278.78s)]
*  but I think the road ahead of us is not easy, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=283.26s)]
*  is not difficult after all of those atrocities [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=286.84s)]
*  that the population have lived through, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=289.61999999999995s)]
*  but I do have hope that change is coming. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  And the millions and millions of people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=296.5s)]
*  that during these last 50 years [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=299.14s)]
*  have been forced to leave their country [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  and search for a life elsewhere, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  I can never forget that image [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=305.68s)]
*  of that little three-year-old boy who lost his life [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=308.38s)]
*  and was drowned in the shores of that beach in Turkey. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=312.52s)]
*  These are people who had dreams, hopes, and aspirations, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=317.16s)]
*  and yet there is life, and there are many [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=321.24s)]
*  who have been willing to give their life for freedom, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=324.6s)]
*  and I hope, I hope, Hassan, that that is the future of Syria. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=328.82s)]
*  I thank you for being with us today. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  Very much appreciate it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=336.32s)]
*  Thank you, Jose. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99aYXWjzrg&t=338.06s)]
