# ‘A bittersweet moment’: Reaction from Israel and inside Gaza over ceasefire deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk)
*  After 15 months of fighting in Gaza and well beyond, Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=0.0s)]
*  It will put an end to the fighting and free dozens of hostages held in Gaza, including Americans, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=6.8s)]
*  in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  This deal will bring the first real break in violence since a week-long truce that expired more than a year ago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=16.96s)]
*  It comes after weeks of talks brokered by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=23.44s)]
*  And amid profound devastation and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where more than 46,000 people have died, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=28.88s)]
*  an unimaginable worry and constant waiting and despair for the families of 60 surviving hostages [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=36.56s)]
*  kidnapped by Hamas after the terrorist attack on October 7, 2023. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=43.36s)]
*  Their families saying this morning, quote, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=48.8s)]
*  In light of reports about an imminent agreement, we welcome and deeply appreciate the return of every hostage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=51.2s)]
*  Each one representing hope and relief, not only for their immediate family, but for our entire community. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=58.4s)]
*  We urgently call for a framework that ensures the return of every person held captive. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=65.28s)]
*  The three-phase deal follows the same structure that President Joe Biden first proposed back in May. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=71.6s)]
*  He spoke this afternoon from the White House. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=78.64s)]
*  The elements of this deal are what I laid out in detail this past May, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=81.36s)]
*  which was embraced by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the U.N. Security Council. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=88.8s)]
*  You know, there was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=96.24s)]
*  And I'm deeply satisfied. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=102.72s)]
*  This day has come, finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=112.32s)]
*  The Palestinian people have gone through hell. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Too many innocent people have died. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=122.72s)]
*  Too many communities have been destroyed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  And this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover and rebuild. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel and Hamas have yet to officially announce a deal, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=132.88s)]
*  but NBC News has learned that the 42-day first phase to release 33 of the hostages in Gaza, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=137.76s)]
*  defined as humanitarian cases, will start on Sunday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=145.2s)]
*  That breaking news is where we start today with former CIA Director MSNBC Senior National Security Analyst John Brennan's here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=150.4s)]
*  Also joining us, former Chief of Staff at the CIA and at the Department of Defense, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=157.84s)]
*  Jeremy Basch is here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=162.24s)]
*  But we're going to start with my colleague, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=163.68s)]
*  live for us in Jerusalem. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=168.08s)]
*  Richard Engel, tell us what you're hearing and what you're learning and what the reaction is. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=169.36s)]
*  So there's been very strong reaction from Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  We have been in touch with our teams there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  They're sending us video of people who are watching television sets intently as the news was coming in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=182.08s)]
*  You could hear a pin drop as people were focused on the screens, waiting for any word, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  because this has been a long several hours. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  There were reports that the deal was coming, then there was a delay of a press conference. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  This deal was announced in Doha. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  And Doha, the Prime Minister of Doha was probably the key interlocutor here, the key negotiator, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=207.28s)]
*  the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister playing an extraordinary role. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  And then when the deal was finally announced and then later confirmed, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=217.2s)]
*  people went out onto the streets. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=221.76s)]
*  They were celebrating some Hamas members also coming out onto the streets to show that they [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=223.6s)]
*  remain. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=230.24s)]
*  They have been dramatically weakened, but they were showing at least a few of them, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=231.44s)]
*  just to say that they are still standing strong. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=236.08s)]
*  But in general, there was a tremendous sense of relief that people can finally [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=238.72s)]
*  move around without the fear that they're going to be bombed at any moment or that soon they will [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=244.0s)]
*  be able to live in an area where there are not constant airstrikes and drones overhead. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=250.16s)]
*  In Israel, the reaction has been more complex, more subdued. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=256.16s)]
*  This is not a happy day. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=261.68s)]
*  This is a hostage deal after all. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=264.64s)]
*  People are happy that the war is ending, happy that they can put this chapter behind them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=267.6s)]
*  This has been a very ugly period for Israel, ugly period in Israel's history, when first it was [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=272.08s)]
*  caught off guard and 1,200 people were massacred by Hamas and there was a tremendous intelligence [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=280.4s)]
*  failure. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=286.8s)]
*  And then when Israel launched its war to find itself accused internationally of gross overreaction [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=287.68s)]
*  and accused of genocide, that was a deeply disturbing experience for people in this country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=296.0s)]
*  So there were some muted celebrations, I guess you could call it, but the hostage families [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=302.8s)]
*  are not celebrating. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=310.56s)]
*  They're trying to be respectful of one another. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=311.68s)]
*  The hostage families are either issuing statements, but those who are the families who [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=314.08s)]
*  are expecting to receive the initial hostages don't want to gloat. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=319.76s)]
*  They don't want to celebrate because they know that other families are still waiting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=323.52s)]
*  and that other families will not be receiving their loved ones, but only receiving remains. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=327.68s)]
*  So this is a complex moment for Israel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  For Gaza, they're very happy to be turning the page for Israel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=336.88s)]
*  They still need to have a formal legal decision to accept the ceasefire. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=340.0s)]
*  So we're going to expect to see Prime Minister Netanyahu facing some criticism probably from [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=346.24s)]
*  members of the right wing of his coalition government, but there's little doubt that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=351.28s)]
*  the ceasefire deal is going to be approved. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Director Brennan, President Joe Biden putting out a statement before his remarks today saying [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=358.55999999999995s)]
*  this, quote, I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31st, 2024, after which [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=365.44s)]
*  it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the change to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=374.96s)]
*  regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and the weakening of Iran, but also of dogged [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=380.4s)]
*  and painstaking American diplomacy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=385.84s)]
*  My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=388.56s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=392.64s)]
*  Yes, Nicole, this is one of the tragic aspects of what I think has been a very good development [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  in terms of a ceasefire and hostage release, but that nearly eight months ago this could [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=400.32s)]
*  have been put into place. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  And I think about all the thousands of individuals who have tragically been killed since that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=407.84s)]
*  time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=412.96s)]
*  But it is the culmination of dogged efforts on the part of the Americans, the Qataris [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  in particular, and also then the Egyptians working with the Israelis in Hamas to see [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=418.32s)]
*  whether or not there could be some arrangement. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=423.12s)]
*  And so we're a few days away from what looks like it's going to be released, about 33 Israeli [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=424.64s)]
*  hostages. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  That's about half of the number of hostages believed to be still alive, even though there [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  are over 90 there and have not been accounted for. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think this first phase is a critically important one and is likely to come off the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=437.44s)]
*  exchange and release of some Palestinian prisoners. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  But the phases two and three are very aspirational. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=445.92s)]
*  And I think there's still a lot of work that needs to be done in order to get there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=449.76s)]
*  But I think we can be pleased that we're seeing now what has been a breakthrough of what has [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=454.56s)]
*  been tried for many, many months. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=459.68s)]
*  I do give the Biden administration and the incoming Trump team also credit for the efforts [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=462.48s)]
*  that they have put forward to be able to achieve this result. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=468.24s)]
*  Jeremy Bash, your first reaction. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=472.96s)]
*  Well, first, let's talk about the seven Americans who are part of those who are still being [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=475.6s)]
*  held in Gaza. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=480.08s)]
*  We believe three are still alive, four whose remains we want brought back to their loved [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=481.92s)]
*  ones. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=487.76s)]
*  The three who are still alive are 65-year-old Keith Siegel, whose wife was released at an [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=488.0s)]
*  earlier hostage release, and she's been waiting and advocating for his release. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=493.92s)]
*  We're also awaiting the release of Sagi Dekelkhan, a father of three, 35 years old, from Kibbutz [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=499.76s)]
*  Neiroz. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=507.12s)]
*  These are the Americans I'm talking about here. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=508.24s)]
*  And then, of course, E. Don Alexander, who was an IDF soldier, an American citizen. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=510.56s)]
*  And we believe that he is alive as well. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=515.36s)]
*  So three living hostages. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=517.36s)]
*  The four whose remains we are also expecting to come out are the remains of Omar Nutra, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=519.28s)]
*  whose parents have been advocating so forcefully and so effectively for his release, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=526.08s)]
*  Itai Khan, whose parents have also come to know—and I spoke to his father, Rubi Khan, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=533.36s)]
*  earlier today—and then Gad and Judy Agai, who were killed on October 7. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=538.72s)]
*  That, of course, is in addition to the other Americans who were killed, like Hirsch Goldberg [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  Poland, who was murdered on September 1, whose parents, John and Rachel, had been on the world [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  stage meeting with the U.S., the Congress, the Pope, the president. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=556.4s)]
*  And so it's a bittersweet moment. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=560.32s)]
*  And I would just say that no matter what happens this Sunday, it's not going to be over, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=563.12s)]
*  because the way the deal is structured, Nicole, there's a 42-day gap between the time that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  Phase 1 is implemented and the time Phase 2 is implemented. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=571.52s)]
*  And at this hour, we still don't know whether all of the Americans will come out. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=574.96s)]
*  There have been some earlier reports that Sagi Dekelkhan and Keith Siegel would come out, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=579.6s)]
*  but that Edan would not, because he's a soldier, that the remains would be left for a later stage. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=584.8s)]
*  And I think that would be a terrible outcome. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=589.52s)]
*  From my perspective, I know from the Biden administration's perspective and the incoming [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=591.76s)]
*  Trump team's perspective, all Americans should come out in Phase 1. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=595.36s)]
*  There should be absolutely no delay. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=599.52s)]
*  And nobody can spike the football or declare a mission accomplished until all the hostages are [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=601.04s)]
*  home. And we are really at the beginning of a very difficult process. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  Previously, there were hostage releases, and then it broke down before Phase 2, 3, and beyond [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=611.04s)]
*  could be implemented. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=616.48s)]
*  So, Nicole, this is not the end. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  This is the beginning of a very arduous, difficult process. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=620.24s)]
*  And I hope the incoming Trump team maintains pressure and does not declare victory when they [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  take office next Monday. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=628.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZWefzreMk&t=631.04s)]
