# ‘You don’t have leadership in Washington’: Widespread reaction after Trump floats taking over Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998)
*  Aaron, what is your reaction to this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=0.0s)]
*  But I don't know, do we call it a proposal, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=2.64s)]
*  do we call it a plan, do we call it an idea? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=4.44s)]
*  What's your reaction to it? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=7.18s)]
*  My head was exploding when I listened to the press conference. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=10.68s)]
*  27 years of working for Republicans and Democrats from the Carter administration to Bush 43. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=14.18s)]
*  No administration that I worked for ever [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=19.42s)]
*  conceived of an idea which was more detached from reality [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=24.72s)]
*  and more dangerous, perhaps with the exception, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=30.24s)]
*  and that there was context here with respect to 9-11 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=33.88s)]
*  for our invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=37.92s)]
*  And it just strikes me how much of an outlier [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  the president actually is. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=46.28s)]
*  You have a situation where the U.S. has now tethered itself to an approach which [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=48.08s)]
*  at best will be interpreted as forced transfer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=52.6s)]
*  Number one, he's undermined traditional U.S. allies, Egypt and Israel, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=56.64s)]
*  who doesn't look at this as a real estate deal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=61.04s)]
*  It's an existential threat for them to absorb large numbers of Palestinians. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=64.38s)]
*  He's validated the fantasies and the narrative of the Israeli right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=68.78s)]
*  And he sent an unmistakable signal to Putin and to Xi [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=73.84s)]
*  that if in fact you want territory, you simply aspire to it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=79.72s)]
*  and you state your capacity completely untethered from anything, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=83.72s)]
*  international law, logic, rationality, to basically assert your control over it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  And it was all done standing next to an Israeli prime minister [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=95.22s)]
*  who looked like a cat that had just swallowed a canary. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=99.26s)]
*  The real takeaway, final point, Jose, the real takeaway here [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  is not the unserious proposal by an unserious president over Gaza. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=106.44s)]
*  The real takeaway to me is the fact that this press conference [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=111.94s)]
*  was a no daylight between Israel and the U.S. press conference. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=115.44s)]
*  He's equipped the prime minister with talking points that will help him [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  keep his government together. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=125.08s)]
*  And it just seems to me what's at stake here is real, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=127.12s)]
*  that is to say the implementation of the first and second phase [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=130.96s)]
*  of the Gaza agreement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=134.18s)]
*  He more or less stepped away from that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=135.5s)]
*  Those are the thoughts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=138.76s)]
*  You know, Aaron, I'm just thinking about your vast experience on issues [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=139.52s)]
*  and, you know, I mean, I think it's important to just, you know, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=143.36s)]
*  underline just how much experience you have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=147.16s)]
*  and how many different negotiations you have been a part of. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=149.74s)]
*  And I'm just wondering when all of those negotiations [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=153.88s)]
*  for the vast majority of them ended up with no progress [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=159.58s)]
*  for the Palestinian people? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=165.68s)]
*  And, you know, Camp David and the Abraham Accords, yes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=167.9s)]
*  But Aaron, where does negotiating the same terms [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=171.7s)]
*  and under the same language become just an echo repeating itself? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=177.98s)]
*  And where do you draw the line, Aaron, on stating things [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=183.98s)]
*  that are completely maybe impossible but that as a negotiating tactic [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=188.96s)]
*  could at least elicit a different conversation? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I stand alone in terms of the number [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  of failed negotiations I participated in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=204.22s)]
*  But this is not that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=207.52s)]
*  This is something that goes beyond even failed American peacemaking efforts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=208.66s)]
*  This is an effort to shackle the Arab states with the absorption [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=212.9s)]
*  of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have already been traumatized [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=217.44s)]
*  and are going to become refugees again should this plan be implemented. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=222.02s)]
*  And it's so detached from reality that I think it has zero chance of being implemented. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  But what is missing here, Jose, is leadership. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=231.2s)]
*  And if you want a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=236.44s)]
*  if you want a conflict-ending solution, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=240.14s)]
*  if you want to best all previous efforts by Republicans and Democrats, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=243.92s)]
*  then what you need are Israeli and Palestinian leaders [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=247.42s)]
*  who are masters of their political houses, not prisoners of their ideologies, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  leaders who are prepared to recognize that negotiation is not based on an asymmetry of power [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=254.9s)]
*  but on a balance of interests. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=259.88s)]
*  And together with those Israeli-Palestinian leaders, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=261.94s)]
*  you need an American president who's got will and skill [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=264.76s)]
*  and a reasonable interpretation of what is required to solve, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=269.02s)]
*  or at least to begin to address what I call the problem [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=275.36s)]
*  of the much too-promised land. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=279.46s)]
*  That's missing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=282.06s)]
*  You don't have leadership in Israel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=283.56s)]
*  You don't have leadership in Palestine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  And you certainly, based on what I saw last night, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=287.34s)]
*  you don't have leadership in Washington. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=291.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t357lQyF998&t=309.46s)]
