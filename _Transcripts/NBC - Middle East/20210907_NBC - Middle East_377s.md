# What U.S. Departure From Afghanistan Means For China
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs)
*  The Wall Street Journal has some new analysis about how the American withdrawal from Afghanistan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=0.0s)]
*  reshuffles global power relations and creates new complications for China and Russia. The [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=5.12s)]
*  journal said this, the stunning meltdown of the United States' Afghan client state marked the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  limits of American hard power. The dramatic scenes of despair in Kabul have frustrated and angered [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=17.28s)]
*  many American allies, particularly in Europe, inflicting considerable reputational damage. Yet [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=23.2s)]
*  despite their propaganda trumpeting the narrative of America's weakness, it does not appear to have [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=28.48s)]
*  escaped Beijing and Moscow that the U.S. isn't the only one losing out. In terms of raw military [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=33.6s)]
*  strength and economic resources, the U.S. remains dominant. Its pivot away from Afghanistan means [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=39.28s)]
*  Washington has more resources to put toward its strategic rivalry with China and Russia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=45.36s)]
*  Unlike Russia and China, countries in Afghanistan's immediate neighborhood, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=51.68s)]
*  America is far more removed from the direct consequences of the Taliban takeover. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=56.0s)]
*  Managing Afghanistan from now on is increasingly a problem for Moscow and Beijing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=61.2s)]
*  and their regional allies. The chaotic and sudden withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  is not good news for China, said Ma Xiaolin, an international relations scholar, who notes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=71.92s)]
*  America still is stronger in technology, manufacturing, and in military power. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=77.68s)]
*  China is not ready to replace the U.S. in the region. The prevailing view among U.S. allies and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=82.8s)]
*  partners in Asia is that Washington now can deliver finally on the pivot to Asia that the Obama [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=89.28s)]
*  administration promised as a way to counter China but largely failed to deliver as it was preoccupied [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=95.6s)]
*  with Afghanistan and the Middle East. All of that analysis from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=101.52s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News foreign correspondent Janice Mackey-Frayer. She is live in Beijing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=106.56s)]
*  Janice, good morning. You spoke yesterday with Pakistan's ambassador to China. What did you learn? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=111.68s)]
*  Well, we've learned, the world has learned that the Taliban is not the only winner here. China [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=119.76s)]
*  and Pakistan are looking to step into the void in Afghanistan and that is going to have strategic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=125.68s)]
*  implications for the U.S. as you say, as it repivots its strategy here in Asia. In the one sense, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=130.8s)]
*  China has feasted on the on the messy withdrawal. They've portrayed it in media as the decline of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=138.8s)]
*  American influence, that its credibility is in shreds, that perhaps the U.S. should be investigated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=145.36s)]
*  for quote the massacre of civilians. But for Beijing, the end of the American presence in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Afghanistan actually presents a greater liability than it does opportunity. There's been a lot of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=157.68s)]
*  talk about the mining and the other resources projects but those are secondary to Beijing for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=163.52s)]
*  security. They're looking at Afghanistan strictly through the lens of domestic security and that's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=168.56s)]
*  where Pakistan comes in. Pakistan is China's close ally. It's also China's conduit to the Taliban. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  They have facilitated meetings including the Taliban delegation that visited here in July. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=180.56s)]
*  At those meetings, the Taliban gave security assurances to China saying that its territory [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  would not be used for its fighters as a base for attacks inside China and this speaks to Beijing's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=192.56s)]
*  fear of Uighur militancy. It's what they've used to justify the detention of Uighurs and other [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=198.96s)]
*  minorities in Xinjiang. In exchange for those assurances, China is dangling the prospect of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=205.28s)]
*  an economic pipeline. I sat down with Pakistan's ambassador to China, Moinul Haq, to get his view [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=210.96s)]
*  on the regional power dynamics and how they're shifting in the era of the Taliban's takeover. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=218.48s)]
*  Who then do you see holding the cards in the region? Who has the power to then [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  hold the Taliban to account? Accountability. Again, you are talking about accountability. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  First of all, it's about Afghanistan. People of Afghanistan, they have to take this historic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=239.04s)]
*  opportunity, this is this opportunity, to come together collectively and have an inclusive [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=244.0s)]
*  government in Kabul, which is not only meet the broader expectations of the international community [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=250.8s)]
*  but also look after their own people. They had enough and the region has seen enough. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=258.4s)]
*  Now Pakistan's relations with the U.S. during the war were seen as [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=266.56s)]
*  duplicitous at best. In fact, Prime Minister Imran Khan has been criticized recently for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=270.8s)]
*  appearing to endorse the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Afghan officials, the government officials [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=277.84s)]
*  who fled, have blamed Pakistan's support for the Taliban as being key to the group's resurgence. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=283.92s)]
*  Now this is something that Pakistani officials flatly deny and reject. The ambassador told me [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=291.2s)]
*  that the power vacuum that now exists in Kabul carries risks for the whole region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=297.12s)]
*  Nobody has been able to control Afghanistan from outside. So all we can do is that we can [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=304.48s)]
*  nudge them, we can encourage them to of course meet the expectations of the international community. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  So the Taliban takeover is in some ways viewed as a victory? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=318.56s)]
*  The Taliban had walked over in Kabul that was given to them in a platter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=323.04s)]
*  So you if you I don't know what you'll call it a victory or what. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=329.52s)]
*  Both Pakistan and China are seeing the Taliban victory as what they call a political reality. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=335.52s)]
*  Really they say it's just a fact on the ground and that the Taliban deserves the chance to see if [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=342.32s)]
*  it can govern. Fascinating interview. It's a new day for sure. NBC's Janice Mackey-Frayer in Beijing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RespJ-mrdVs&t=348.72s)]
