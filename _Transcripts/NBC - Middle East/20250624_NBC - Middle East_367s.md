# Delayed briefings on Iran strikes show 'how chaotic' Trump admin is: Iranian-American Congresswoman
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs)
*  And joining me now is Arizona Congresswoman Yasemin Ansari. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=0.0s)]
*  She is the first Iranian-American Democrat elected to Congress. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  She represents the Phoenix area, where there are an estimated 25,000 Iranian-Americans. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=7.44s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=12.6s)]
*  Your district does have one of the largest Iranian-American populations in the country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=15.96s)]
*  So when that briefing does finally take place, what are the key questions you'd like answered? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=20.6s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=25.64s)]
*  There are so many questions I have been looking forward to asking this administration, including, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=29.3s)]
*  first and foremost, what was the intelligence that showed us the urgency of actually taking [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=33.74s)]
*  military action against Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=39.06s)]
*  I'm also extremely concerned that the president decided to unilaterally and illegally make [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=41.1s)]
*  this decision without not only getting authorization from Congress, but not briefing Congress. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=46.14s)]
*  And I think the fact that they canceled this briefing today just goes to show how chaotic [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=50.86s)]
*  this administration really is. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=56.66s)]
*  I don't think there's agreement within senior-level officials. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=58.3s)]
*  We've seen over the last couple of days that they have completely contradicted one another [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=61.54s)]
*  in terms of what the purpose of any of this was, with the president himself tweeting about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=66.74s)]
*  regime change just two days ago, to them saying there's a ceasefire, to Tulsi Gabbard saying [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=71.5s)]
*  the intelligence isn't there, then saying the intelligence is there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=77.46s)]
*  So they want to make it easier to lie to the American public, and that is unacceptable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=80.46s)]
*  As we wait for those answers, what do you know about right now the situation inside [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=85.4s)]
*  Iran? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=89.68s)]
*  For example, are there still Americans who want to get out, and if so, is help available [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=90.68s)]
*  to them? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  There is not only very little information about the Americans who are inside of Iran, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=97.98s)]
*  which I'm sure there are, but also very little help in getting out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=104.0s)]
*  We know many flights were canceled over the course of a couple of days. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=108.48s)]
*  The biggest issue that I'm concerned about when it comes to the Iranian people who vastly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=112.16s)]
*  and vehemently oppose their regime is we already are hearing reports about how the regime is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  cracking down even further on the civilian population, using what just happened as a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  reason to imprison even more people, accusing them of being spies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think what is going to happen is we are going to see an even more repressive Islamic [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=132.72s)]
*  regime that cracks down on its people, which is devastating for people who did not ask [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  for any of this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  What have you heard from your constituents? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  What are their worries for family members who may be still living in Iran or visiting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=148.08s)]
*  Iran? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  I represent an extremely diverse district, a district that's heavily impacted by ICE [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=154.56s)]
*  and Trump's mass deportation policies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Largely speaking, I can tell you that my opponent, my constituents were extremely opposed to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=161.96s)]
*  the U.S. militarily taking action and to the potential of another endless war for the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=167.64s)]
*  United States. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=172.92s)]
*  My constituents can't even afford housing or health care or their utility bills. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=173.92s)]
*  So the idea of tax dollars being spent on this was egregious. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=177.72s)]
*  When I've talked to Iranian Americans, not only in Arizona or across the country, they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=181.72s)]
*  were very concerned about the way that Donald Trump conducted himself in all of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  Remember, just last week, he used social media to ask a city of 10 million people in Iran [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=192.2s)]
*  to evacuate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=198.48s)]
*  This is a massive metropolitan city where people have nowhere to go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=199.48s)]
*  There are just so many concerns here from the chaoticness and recklessness of the way [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  this president handles foreign policy to the fact that he's not even carrying out the foreign [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  policy priorities of the American people or carrying out his own promises, which was to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=213.6s)]
*  not get the United States involved in any new wars. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=217.92s)]
*  Well, as you know, President Trump had earlier floated the idea of regime change, though [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  in the last hour while on Air Force One, he said he is opposed to the idea. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=225.52s)]
*  And he was quoted as saying regime change takes chaos. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=229.48s)]
*  And ideally, we don't want to see so much chaos. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=233.48s)]
*  Do you have a sense of Iran right now and whether there would be an embrace of the idea [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=237.6s)]
*  of regime change there or among your Iranian American constituents? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=243.72s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  Again, the vast majority of Iranians oppose the regime in Iran. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  I also think it's important to look at the history of not only Iran, but the Middle East [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  and foreign countries writ large, where intervention and trying to influence regime change from [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=258.96s)]
*  the outside is not effective. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=265.24s)]
*  Couple of years ago, there was a massive women-life freedom, women-led protest movement in Iran [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=267.76s)]
*  where Iranian people sought to topple their regime. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  And then we saw thousands of people imprisoned and hundreds killed by this regime. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=276.12s)]
*  What I am concerned about now with the flip-flopping of this president is that I think that he [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=281.4s)]
*  has now emboldened this regime. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  Not only do we not know whether or not the strikes, the military action the United States [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=288.96s)]
*  took was successful, we have no credible reality on that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=294.4s)]
*  And so it could be that this regime not only could have moved, and the knowledge will continue [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=299.44s)]
*  because, of course, the nuclear scientists are still there, but now they will be skeptical [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=305.32s)]
*  of everyone internally and wanting to survive themselves. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=309.24s)]
*  And so this could become an even more hostile regime in Iran as a result. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  They will likely oppress their people even more. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=317.88s)]
*  We already know that to be the case, with new folks being imprisoned in Evin Prison, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=320.44s)]
*  which is one of the most notorious prisons there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  So again, coming back to Donald Trump, no clear objective. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=326.96s)]
*  When you talk about taking out nuclear facilities and then regime change within the span of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=331.44s)]
*  48 hours, you are causing mass chaos, not only for a country, but for a region and for [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=335.8s)]
*  the world. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=341.8s)]
*  Congressman Yasemin Ansari, thank you so much. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=342.8s)]
*  We appreciate you coming on. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=345.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlYSOATmxs&t=361.32s)]
