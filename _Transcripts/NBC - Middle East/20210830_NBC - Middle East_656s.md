# The 13 Fallen Soldiers Passed ‘Doing The Most Honorable Thing’ Imaginable
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8)
*  Among the 13 U.S. troops killed in the Kabul airport attack last week, two women Marines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=0.0s)]
*  who volunteered to search evacuee Afghan women and children, showing unimaginable selflessness [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=8.24s)]
*  and bravery through their ultimate sacrifice and through their moments of comfort among [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  the chaos for the fleeing families. Marine Sergeant Nicole Jeeve, just 23 years old from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=18.56s)]
*  Sacramento, is seen here accompanying young Afghan girls across the tarmac. About a week [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=24.28s)]
*  before the attack, she posted this picture of her within her arms cradling a baby, and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=29.38s)]
*  she wrote this caption, quote, I love my job. Also killed in the attack, 25 year old Marine [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  Sergeant Yohani Rosario from Massachusetts, New York Times says this about her, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=44.18s)]
*  Rosario's service was not only crucial to evacuating thousands of women and children, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=50.18s)]
*  but it epitomizes what it means to be a Marine, putting herself in danger for the protection [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=55.22s)]
*  of American values so that others might enjoy them. Marine First Lieutenant John Coppola [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=60.78s)]
*  said. Amy McGrath, Matthew Dowd and Anne Guerin are back. Amy McGrath, your thoughts? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=66.58s)]
*  That's what being a Marine is all about, service to country. I think it's important to note [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=74.18s)]
*  to the American public that these Marines, the Marines that passed tragically in Afghanistan, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=81.05999999999999s)]
*  you know, they saved thousands of lives in what they were doing and thousands of lives of people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=87.86s)]
*  they didn't even know. But those very same people who they saved to bring to a better life [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=95.94s)]
*  were the same people that stood side by side with those of us that fought in Afghanistan [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=104.42s)]
*  as Marines for 20 years. And I think it's just about, you know, the most honorable thing you can [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=111.78s)]
*  do. They're absolutely heroic individuals. And it's just sad. And I'm, you know, I'm certainly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  glad that our time there is coming to an end. But these Marines served heroically. And today is a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=127.94s)]
*  day to honor all those who fought and died in Afghanistan from 2001 all the way to today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=137.06s)]
*  Anne Guerin, the president and first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, set out to do just what Amy's describing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=147.86s)]
*  to honor them yesterday. This is something I think that this president is uniquely fluent in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=154.42s)]
*  This language is, I think he calls it a black hole of grief that parents feel when losing a loved one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=166.66s)]
*  Just take us inside your understanding of how that went. And I know Jen Psaki talked about it today. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=173.54s)]
*  These interactions are always about the families who have lost the people they love the most on the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=179.94000000000003s)]
*  planet and the people they leave behind. But they change a president. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. And for the president, he's meeting these people on the worst day of their lives. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=191.46s)]
*  To your point, this is something that Biden has a unique personal history with and has been [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=198.82000000000002s)]
*  really for quite a long time, going back long before he was vice president. He made a point [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=207.78s)]
*  of trying to seek out people who had suffered a loss, giving people his phone number, telling [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=215.38s)]
*  people to call his office if you need to talk to somebody, particularly parents who'd lost a child [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=222.18s)]
*  after his son Bo's death. And of course, he lost his very young daughter in a car accident. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=229.7s)]
*  His very young daughter in a car crash 30 years before that. So his own personal story of loss [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=235.78s)]
*  and redemption is something that has been a big part of his political biography. It's also just [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=243.38s)]
*  been a big part of who he is as a person and a politician. We don't know quite what happened [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=248.1s)]
*  yesterday in that interaction. I'm sure some of them went well, but apparently at least a couple [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=254.1s)]
*  of them didn't go so well. And that would be a new thing for this president. In the main, his [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=260.18s)]
*  efforts to reach out and be empathetic, hug people, say, look, I understand because I've [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=268.42s)]
*  been through it, have been not only well received, but a thing that really seemed to be part of a boon [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=275.62s)]
*  in his political makeup. It's a weird thing to think about that something so awful [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=284.26000000000005s)]
*  could ultimately redound to a politician's benefit, but it's just part of his story and part of who he [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=290.1s)]
*  is. It's definitely part of the way people think about him when they're deciding whether to vote [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=295.38s)]
*  for him. And if that is changing, in part because of reaction to what's happening in Afghanistan, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=299.62s)]
*  who the parents of these fallen Marines and Army and Navy personnel might be, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  that would be different. And we don't know yet enough about everything that happened in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=318.34s)]
*  that room to make a judgment on that, but it definitely seemed like something was different. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=323.46s)]
*  Matt Dowd, you and I, I remember when your son deployed. I mean, it's excruciating, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=328.18s)]
*  and it may be about this president. It may have nothing to do with this president. It may just be [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=337.3s)]
*  about pain. But to your broader point, a point you've been making forcefully and bravely and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=341.3s)]
*  elegantly, more so than anyone else on television, I think for many days now, this idea that we never [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=346.66s)]
*  should have been there seems to be at least highlighted by the fact that a lot of papers [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=353.22s)]
*  headlines in their tributes to these men and women were about their age when 9-11 happened. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=360.1s)]
*  They were babies. That's what's amazing about this. I mean, I never thought when my son went [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  in as a 19-year-old that we would be here 17 years later, just finally getting out of this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  I'll say something about Joe Biden in this, having been the father of a son that served, is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=381.62s)]
*  when you have a child that serves in a war zone, if you have a child that serves in a war, there is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=388.5s)]
*  not a day that goes by that you don't hesitate and worry about picking up the newspaper or turning [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=393.7s)]
*  on the television and seeing some news about some attack in somewhere where you think your child is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=399.78s)]
*  It's every single day, every single day. I think Joe Biden not only has mentioned before about his [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=407.22s)]
*  own personal tragedy that provides him the empathy, he's the first president in more than a generation, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=413.38000000000005s)]
*  in more than a generation. I'm trying to think of the last president that had a child that served [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=419.54s)]
*  in a war zone. That gives you a special insight into what it means. It gives you an extra dose [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=424.18s)]
*  of empathy, but I also think it gives you a sense of wisdom about decisions you make. You're not [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=429.86s)]
*  making a decision about going to war or staying in a war unrelated to your own personal circumstances, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=435.3s)]
*  which I think is very informative. I think the fact that Joe Biden had a son that served in a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=442.66s)]
*  war zone is informed his decisions that, well, it should. The decisions he makes, I think, are [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=448.98s)]
*  completely part of that decision. I'm glad that we have a president that understands that pain, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=455.7s)]
*  not only the people that serve and the sacrifices he's served, but the families [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=463.46s)]
*  that are left back at home worried about what's going on. And the fact that he made the decision [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=467.7s)]
*  and the fact that we lost 13 people in this very tragically, but very heroically in this, as was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=473.14s)]
*  said, saving other people's lives from around the world who they didn't even know their names of, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=479.7s)]
*  I think should give some credit. And again, I'm going to say this again to Joe Biden for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  making the hard choice. It was a very difficult, hard political choice to go through with this, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=489.22s)]
*  but his empathy that is at his core, not only, as I said, from his personal circumstances, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=496.1s)]
*  but there's a special dose of empathy, which I think gives you wisdom as a commander in chief [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=500.82000000000005s)]
*  that we have not had a president in a long time that had when you have somebody that's one of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=506.82000000000005s)]
*  your children that is served. And I think that is part of this story that I think of why Joe Biden [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=512.58s)]
*  knew he was going to suffer the political backlash from many parts of this, many parts of it. And [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=518.66s)]
*  again, I'll say thank God he made this decision. Thank you for Joe Biden for making this decision, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=523.86s)]
*  because I don't want to have to talk to another parent and give them advice about what it's like [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=529.14s)]
*  for them and how they can get through having a son or a daughter in a war zone and them not knowing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=536.18s)]
*  exactly what they're accomplishing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=542.42s)]
*  Amy McGrath, I want to give you the last word, and I want your thoughts to anything that's been said, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=543.94s)]
*  but I also want to ask you this question. What is helpful? I mean, what in the discourse, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=552.74s)]
*  and not that I control any of the discourse, but what is the best way to honor these families and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=558.82s)]
*  their lives and their service and what they believed in? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=565.3000000000001s)]
*  I think it was helpful right now, and it's hard to sometimes watch the political back and forth [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=567.94s)]
*  using this conflict as sort of a political weapon if people could try not to do that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=579.3800000000001s)]
*  Because the folks that served over there, like myself, like my husband, we served protecting our [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=586.74s)]
*  country. And our service mattered. As was said in the panel previously, we haven't been attacked [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=593.86s)]
*  in the 9-11 style fashion since 9-11. And that's something. And it did matter. And there's lots of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=603.86s)]
*  things that went wrong in Afghanistan. I could be one of the first ones to say 20 or 100 things that [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=610.98s)]
*  went wrong. But at the end of the day, we did have thousands of Americans that died that sacrificed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=618.02s)]
*  And today is a day where we look back and we just need to honor them and try not to politicize this [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=625.46s)]
*  as much as possible. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=633.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA016zu93t8&t=648.02s)]
