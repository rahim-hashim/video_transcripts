# Biden directs U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A)
*  Monica Alba, at the White House, there's been a national security meeting, as you have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=0.0s)]
*  reporting. You were the first to report to us that this warning was being given by the U.S. that a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  ballistic missile attack was imminent from Iran. What more are you hearing from the administration? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=11.52s)]
*  MONICA ALBA, White House Press Secretary, National Security Council, USA, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=17.04s)]
*  I can tell you, Andrea, that, right now, President Biden and Vice President Harris [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=17.92s)]
*  are monitoring all of these ongoing developments in real time from the White House Situation Room. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=21.76s)]
*  They have been briefed by their national security teams, and that has been going on for the last [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=27.2s)]
*  four or five hours, I'm told. So, this is something that the U.S. had early indications of, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=32.8s)]
*  and then they have been, of course, tracking and in touch with their relevant counterparts [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=38.4s)]
*  in terms of Israel and other potential allies here about how to handle it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=43.2s)]
*  And another piece of information that we're just getting now, Andrea, is that the president has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=48.0s)]
*  indeed directed the U.S. military to help Israel's defense against these attacks and to shoot down [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=52.48s)]
*  missiles that are targeting Israel. This is something that we saw happen back when Iran [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=59.04s)]
*  launched those projectiles and missiles in April, and it is something that's happening again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=64.56s)]
*  Now, there are some key differences and questions about how this attack is playing out compared [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  to the previous one, but the U.S. has been very firm in that it will stand with Israel and its [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=75.44s)]
*  right to defend itself against attacks like this specifically. And we know that President Biden, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=80.24s)]
*  in recent weeks, his top priority has been to try to limit anything that would escalate to a wider war. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=86.72s)]
*  But as this is all happening so quickly, he is developing, of course, and monitoring this and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=93.6s)]
*  trying to generate whatever kind of response the U.S. will have to this rhetorically as this is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=100.0s)]
*  still going on. But for now, they are monitoring everything. They are waiting to see exactly how [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=106.56s)]
*  long these waves of attacks may continue. And it is notable that the president and the vice president, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=111.76s)]
*  who were supposed to have very different schedules on a day like today and this week, that has all [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=118.16s)]
*  been altered not just by this ongoing security situation in the Middle East, but by the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=124.0s)]
*  devastation from Hurricane Helene. So they are really in the moment changing things, and they are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=129.6s)]
*  really putting aside the politics and the campaign trail for the moment to deal with this kind of a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=135.44s)]
*  national security crisis. But it is notable that the vice president, of course, has been brought [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=141.76s)]
*  into all of this as well. She canceled and came back earlier from some campaign commitments yesterday [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=146.16s)]
*  to get a FEMA briefing, again, related to Hurricane Helene. And then today, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=151.28s)]
*  she is focused on this along with the president, I'm told. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=155.12s)]
*  And the other thing, Andrea, that we're monitoring is to see how many of the allies of Israel and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=158.88s)]
*  the U.S. might be involved here in coming and helping Israel. And we know that the U.S. at times [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=165.36s)]
*  has been a player that is part of that conversation and helping to broker some of those talks with some [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  of these other countries that might be coming to their aid. So that is something that is ongoing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=177.68s)]
*  and that they are still discussing. And then separately, on that question of the active shooter [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=182.24s)]
*  incident that occurred earlier, I'm told by a U.S. official that it is fair to call it a terrorist [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=188.4s)]
*  attack from their perspective, that their understanding is that the shooters have been, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=195.44s)]
*  at this point, killed by police. That is coming from a U.S. official, but that the Israeli police [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=200.56s)]
*  would, of course, have more information on that separate attack on that report of the active shooter [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=206.56s)]
*  incident that was unfolding in Israel, as, of course, the president, the vice president, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  and their national security officials are monitoring all of this and juggling all of it in real time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctPAizVb0A&t=216.4s)]
