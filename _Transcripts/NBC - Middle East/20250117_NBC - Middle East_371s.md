# ‘Will Hamas actually keep the ceasefire?’: Fmr. Israeli Amb. Michael Oren on the latest agreement
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us)
*  Joining me now is Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Ambassador, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=0.0s)]
*  thank you very much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=4.84s)]
*  Are you confident now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=5.84s)]
*  There were a lot of twists and turns. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=6.84s)]
*  Israeli politics are notably confusing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=8.76s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu, known as Bibi, is the master of survival in these [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=13.32s)]
*  contexts. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  What we've been told and certainly read from Minister Ben Vigier on Twitter was that he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  is against this deal, that he will not bring down the coalition, but he will resign if [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=26.52s)]
*  it goes forward with the trading of the prisoners because the prime minister will not agree [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=32.12s)]
*  to resume hostilities, resume the war, in other words. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=36.84s)]
*  And he thinks that that is a dangerous step. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=43.4s)]
*  That said, from my understanding, Netanyahu has support from several other members of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=45.72s)]
*  the Knesset, opposition leaders, Lapid and Benny Gantz. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=52.6s)]
*  So this will not bring down his government. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  Is that your read of it? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=58.5s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=59.86s)]
*  Good to be with you, Andrea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=60.86s)]
*  And there's nothing about this that isn't immensely complex and deeply agonizing for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=61.86s)]
*  the people of Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=65.78s)]
*  Keep in mind that, again, there may get 33 hostages back over the course of six weeks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=67.14s)]
*  We don't know at the end of the day how many of those 33 are alive, how many are coming [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=72.28s)]
*  back in an ambulance and how many are coming back in a box. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=75.74s)]
*  And that will leave almost 60 hostages dead and alive in Gaza over the next two phases [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=79.28s)]
*  of this plan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=85.14s)]
*  Very, very complex. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=86.14s)]
*  And Hamas is still fighting. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=87.69999999999999s)]
*  Hamas is still shelling border communities. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=90.82s)]
*  Hamas is still killing soldiers, something between 40 soldiers killed over the last six [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  weeks in Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=96.86s)]
*  So Hamas is very much there, and Hamas will declare victory. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=98.02s)]
*  So it's immensely, immensely painful. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  And on top of all that, freeing these Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=102.78s)]
*  It looks like one line on the screen here, but it's hundreds and hundreds of Palestinian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=105.94s)]
*  prisoners who have killed Israelis. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=110.58s)]
*  And the families of those people murdered have to understand, you know, why is this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=112.62s)]
*  guy going home and getting a hero's welcome when our loved ones are still on the ground? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=116.94s)]
*  In addition to getting approval from the inner cabinet, the broad cabinet and the Knesset, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=120.98s)]
*  you also have to approve from the Israeli Supreme Court, because the relatives of those [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=126.66s)]
*  victims are now going to appeal this decision, this deal to the Israeli Supreme Court. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=130.46s)]
*  With all that, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=135.34s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is a political genius, the ultimate survivor. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=137.42s)]
*  If he wants it, it's going to go through. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=141.26s)]
*  The question is, what does he want in the long run? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=143.94s)]
*  Yes, the first phase calls for a 42-day ceasefire, and it was really withdrawal from certain [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  parts of Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=151.98s)]
*  But Hamas wants a complete withdrawal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=152.98s)]
*  It wants the end of the war, which means Hamas wins, and it's going to hold on to those [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=154.62s)]
*  hostages, the remaining 60 hostages, until that's done. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=158.62s)]
*  So the big question is, what happens after this phase? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=161.46s)]
*  The second phase, the third phase? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=164.22s)]
*  And a bigger question after that, what is the position of the Trump administration? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=166.62s)]
*  And a lot of credit is being given by many people, including hostage families, to Donald [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=171.42s)]
*  Trump for really laying down the hammer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=176.54s)]
*  As much on Netanyahu as on Hamas, of which he has a little less influence. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=179.34s)]
*  They're more influenced by the Israel successful efforts against Iran, Hezbollah, the Syrian [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=183.78s)]
*  collapse, so they've lost their patrons, pretty much. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=189.38s)]
*  But in any case, Donald Trump and his envoy, Steve Whitgoff, were given credit from a lot [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  of people, including I talked to Secretary Blinken this week, and he said that Whitgoff [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=201.42s)]
*  was terrific in helping close the deal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  That said, the three hostages who are coming out first, potentially on Sunday, are three [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=209.94s)]
*  Israeli women who are, we're told, are in terrible shape, have been abused, assaulted. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=216.04s)]
*  There's unspeakable crimes against them, and that is going to have, that is going to reverberate [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=221.34s)]
*  among the Israeli public as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  But the Americans are going to have to wait. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=228.58s)]
*  And there are three surviving Americans, we've been told, that two of them will come out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=230.94s)]
*  in this first period. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=235.62s)]
*  They're going to have to wait days, even weeks, into this first 40-day period before they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=236.62s)]
*  come out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  And then there's a third American, Alexander, who would be in the second phase, and getting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=243.34s)]
*  to that second phase is going to be difficult. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=247.62s)]
*  So there's a lot of angst, frankly, among the American hostage families, but what they're [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=250.34s)]
*  saying publicly and privately is that they're just happy for the families who are getting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=254.06s)]
*  their loved ones back, as well as the four American families that are waiting and hoping [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=259.9s)]
*  and praying for the remains of their loved ones to be returned to. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=265.9s)]
*  And this is why this event is so mixed with joy and anguish and anger and pain. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  Think about the literally hundreds of thousands of Israelis who have fought in this war, who [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  have lost friends, many of them come back irreparably maimed and saying, OK, what do [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=280.54s)]
*  we fight for if Hamas survives? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=284.66s)]
*  So there's going to be anger, there's going to be confusion and regret. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=286.54s)]
*  And then the big question is, will Hamas actually keep the ceasefire? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=290.82s)]
*  Remember, there was a ceasefire in place on October 7, 2023. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  There was a ceasefire in place in November 2023 during the first hostage exchange. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=298.86s)]
*  Hamas broke all those ceasefires. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  It has broken every ceasefire that's ever been there we've reached. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=304.94s)]
*  So will Hamas keep the ceasefire? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=308.22s)]
*  You could have a situation where all of a sudden there'll be some rockets on an Israeli [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=310.2s)]
*  community, and Hamas will say, well, it's not us, it's somebody else on the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=313.66s)]
*  We know how that game works out. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=319.2s)]
*  Or there'll be an ambush of Israeli soldiers, and they'll say, well, it wasn't us, it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=321.14s)]
*  was some other breakaway faction. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=324.3s)]
*  I don't know whether the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu, are counting on the fact [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=327.26s)]
*  that Hamas will break the ceasefire. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=332.14s)]
*  And then they'll have an arrangement with the incoming president, President Trump, that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=334.02s)]
*  says, OK, the United States will give full backing to the Israeli and Israeli forces [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=337.26s)]
*  to complete the destruction of Hamas. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=342.34s)]
*  And that is what some ministers are actually saying in the state of Israel today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=344.26s)]
*  Or whether it's even a broader understanding about Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dId0_uQC3us&t=348.58s)]
