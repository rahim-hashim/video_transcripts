# Congressional leaders want to help Israel, Sen. Schumer says after Biden call
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8)
*  President Biden holding a call with the four congressional leaders a short time ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's go right to NBC's Julie Serkin on Capitol Hill with more reaction. So Julie, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=4.64s)]
*  Congress has yet to agree on an aid bill for Israel. Will yesterday's strike speed up that process? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  That's a really good question, Alex. You know, Republicans and Democrats have both been calling [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  on Speaker Johnson to do something. Some Republicans, especially those with national [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=20.96s)]
*  security credentials, those in leadership in the Senate, have called on Johnson to put specifically [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=25.92s)]
*  the Senate-passed foreign aid package that that chamber cleared in February. That would approve [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  funds not only for Israel but also for Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, and some humanitarian relief [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=36.0s)]
*  for Gaza. Speaker Johnson, though, this morning heard a little bit about what he said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=40.96s)]
*  had said that the House plans to put their own foreign aid bill on the floor, indicating they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=45.36s)]
*  will not take up the Senate-passed package, at least not at first, at least not next week. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  But the details of what they plan to put forward is far from clear. I want you to take a listen, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=54.64s)]
*  though, to what one Senate Democrat and one powerful House Republican had to say. It sounds [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=59.6s)]
*  like they're on the same page about the path forward here. Watch. I think what really has to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=65.04s)]
*  happen, you know, is Congress has got to finally pass this supplemental bill that the Senate passed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  two months ago. If we can do that, we can provide aid for Israel to defend itself against Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=76.0s)]
*  I think that the speaker has been very clear. He supports Ukraine funding. He supports funding [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  for Israel. He sees that the path is for that to come to the House floor this week. I think it will [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=88.24s)]
*  have overwhelming support, both the Ukraine, Israel, and Asia packages, not just because of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  what's happened with Iran escalating the conflict in the Middle East, but because these are allies [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  that need and deserve our support. Alex, I'm looking at a transcript sent from the office [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  of the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. He held a press conference moments ago in New York [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=109.36s)]
*  where he shared details of that phone call that you mentioned between President Biden and the four [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=113.84s)]
*  congressional leaders, including Speaker Johnson, by the way. He said in part here that, quote, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=118.72s)]
*  there was a consensus on the phone among all leaders that we had to help Israel and help Ukraine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=122.64s)]
*  And now hopefully we can work that out and get this done next week. We'll see if they can get [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=128.32s)]
*  there when Congress returns tomorrow. Hey, everyone, MSNBC has a new and improved app. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLO1oDWmS8&t=132.88s)]
