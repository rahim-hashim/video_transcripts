# BREAKING: Netanyahu praises Trump after U.S. bombs Iran nuclear sites
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ)
*  Let me bring in my colleague, Vaughn Hilliard, who's at the White House for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Vaughn, what can you fill in for us about how the day unfolded? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Vaughn Hilliard, White House Press Secretary, New Jersey [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=7.4s)]
*  Nicole, there's a lot of unanswered questions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=8.0s)]
*  It was just 24 hours ago that I was on a tarmac in New Jersey outside of his Bedminster Golf [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=9.84s)]
*  Club when I asked the president very explicitly whether the U.S. had intelligence that Iran [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=15.72s)]
*  was actively building a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=23.36s)]
*  He told me that his intelligence community and director of national intelligence, Tulsi [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=27.32s)]
*  Gabbard, who notably you did not see standing behind him there at the White House delivering [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  these remarks, that their assessments that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=37.08s)]
*  at least the U.S. had no intelligence of that, was, quote, wrong. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=42.6s)]
*  I asked him whether he believed that Israel would be able to take out these nuclear facilities [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  on its own, like Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu repeated two different times over the last [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  48 hours. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=60.04s)]
*  And he undercut that assessment from the Israeli prime minister, suggesting that the U.S. was [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=61.04s)]
*  the only one that had the capacity to effectively, especially in the case of Fordow, which has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=65.48s)]
*  this underground nuclear facility a half a mile under the ground, be able to adequately [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=71.16s)]
*  drop a bomb that would be able to take out this nuclear facility. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=76.08s)]
*  And while he opened the door to this idea of two weeks, he never said that he was going [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=80.8s)]
*  to give two weeks to Iran to come back to the negotiating table over a potential nuclear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=85.0s)]
*  agreement, notably one that he and his first administration pulled out back in 2018. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=89.96s)]
*  But here today in striking fashion, deciding to use the U.S. military in an offensive fashion [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=94.96s)]
*  within Iran despite just 24 hours ago again, the Iranian foreign minister in an interview [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=100.68s)]
*  with our colleague Andrea Mitchell, making it clear that Iran was still interested in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=106.6s)]
*  negotiating a potential deal where they would be able to enrich a certain level of uranium. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  Clearly, the president, after two months of negotiations, dismissing those overtures and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=116.64s)]
*  deciding to move forward with these airstrikes, Nicole. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  Vaughn, let me ask you if you have any reporting that explains what he is referring to when [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  the president says if peace doesn't come quickly, then, I mean, he seems to be threatening [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=133.72s)]
*  further, is it further American involvement in attacks on Iran or is that something the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=141.76s)]
*  White House might describe as, I don't know, part of his deal making? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=148.84s)]
*  Do we know what the further threat is to Iran? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=154.12s)]
*  The president has said that boots on the ground would be a last resort, that that is not his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  plan. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=161.96s)]
*  He noted tonight that there are no exact plans of further aggression inside of Iran, that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  these were the end of the initial airstrikes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=169.44s)]
*  It's now up to Iran to come to, again, a nuclear negotiating table here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=171.68s)]
*  But for the president here, I think that this is worth noting, that we've had a conversation [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  over this idea of a two-week timeline, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=181.56s)]
*  It was three weeks ago that he suggested there would be consequences for Russia if it didn't [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=183.72s)]
*  agree to a ceasefire agreement or a peace deal with Ukraine. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  And that deadline came and went. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  Of course, the president and his first administration threatened to strike and blow up North Korea. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  He has threatened repeatedly to strike and blow up Iran. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  And this here, I think, is notable because these are the most significant offensive strikes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=204.12s)]
*  we have seen the president move forward with since he killed Iranian military General Soleimani [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=209.0s)]
*  back in 2020. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=215.36s)]
*  I think it's important for folks to remember the retaliation, which Iran has threatened [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=216.36s)]
*  to do this time around. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=221.6s)]
*  Iran launched airstrikes at a U.S. air base in Iraq, and more than 100 service personnel [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=223.24s)]
*  ultimately walked away with traumatic brain injuries. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=232.16s)]
*  And there is still that looming threat here of how Iran is going to potentially retaliate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=236.96s)]
*  against the U.S. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  The president making clear that they should not and that he is prepared and equipped to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=243.36s)]
*  use the U.S. military again to further activate troops in an offensive matter within Iran. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=247.0s)]
*  Vaughn, stick around for us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=252.76s)]
*  I want to bring into our coverage NBC News foreign correspondent Matt Bradley. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=256.68s)]
*  We heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before we heard from Donald Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=260.84s)]
*  What did he have to say? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=267.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, Nicole, I mean, President or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu couldn't have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=268.44s)]
*  been more pleased with President Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=274.12s)]
*  His very brief remarks in English were filled with superlatives and just a palpable sense [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=276.72s)]
*  of joy at what President Trump had done. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  And it was it was actually extraordinary to see just how grateful President Prime Minister [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=285.8s)]
*  Netanyahu was in such a public way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=291.04s)]
*  He said America has been truly surpassed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=293.36s)]
*  It has done what no other country on earth could do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=295.48s)]
*  He said that President Trump in the United States acted with a lot of strength. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=298.36s)]
*  He said, President Trump, I thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=302.88s)]
*  The people of Israel thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=304.92s)]
*  The forces of civilization thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=306.16s)]
*  And then he did God bless America. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=308.56s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  It was very much just a totally dedicated speech to praising the president. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=311.92s)]
*  And this is very interesting because remember, Nicole, just a couple of months ago, it looked [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=317.68s)]
*  as though President Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu were kind of on the outs. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=321.32000000000005s)]
*  President Trump was negotiating with Iran, something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  has constantly said he doesn't want to see negotiations with Iran. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=329.0s)]
*  The president made a very high profile visit to the Middle East and didn't visit Israel, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=332.92s)]
*  America's top ally in the Middle East, one of its top allies in the world. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=338.08s)]
*  So it looked as though the president and Netanyahu weren't going to be the best friends that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=342.6s)]
*  everybody had imagined during the Biden years, when it looked as though Biden was very much [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=348.52s)]
*  falling out with Netanyahu. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=352.48s)]
*  Now President Trump seems to have sort of tethered himself not just to Netanyahu, but [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=354.8s)]
*  to his adventurers throughout the entire Middle East. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=359.68s)]
*  And that could become very, very dangerous. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, President Trump did mention Qasem Soleimani in that speech. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani was the head of the Quds Force, who President Trump had assassinated back [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=368.76s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  Much of the civil or much of the defense and security and intelligence establishment was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=375.0s)]
*  were telling President Trump that this is going to be a bad idea, that there's going [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  to be blowback, that the Iranians will attack America. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=382.88s)]
*  Well, they didn't really. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=385.4s)]
*  There wasn't really that much blowback. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=387.4s)]
*  A previous strike that the U.S. did against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria back [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=389.92s)]
*  in 2017 under President Trump's direction, that also didn't have the same kind of blowback [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=393.56s)]
*  that a lot of people were worried about. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=399.24s)]
*  It's quite likely that President Trump remembered all of those warnings and how they didn't come [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=401.12s)]
*  true. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=406.48s)]
*  He may believe that he can stroll into the ring, make a few quick punches and walk out [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=407.48s)]
*  a champ. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's unclear whether or not that's going to happen because Benjamin Netanyahu is going [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  to be on some level held to the notion that if you break it, you buy it, basically. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=418.84s)]
*  This is what happened to the U.S. in Iraq, the invasion and the toppling of the Saddam [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=425.56s)]
*  Hussein regime that caused so much instability, not just in Iraq, but in neighboring countries [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  as well for decades. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=433.88s)]
*  Now you're going to be seeing something like this in Iran. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=435.96s)]
*  As we hear the conversation here in Israel, among the top-level politicians, increasingly [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  from destroying Iran's nuclear program to affecting regime change in Iran, which we [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=444.42s)]
*  as Americans know that that is a very troubling concept of regime change. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=450.18s)]
*  It's been very frustrating for previous U.S. presidents before President Trump. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=454.14000000000004s)]
*  But with this mentality now, if President Trump believes that he can just walk away [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=458.94s)]
*  from this situation, that's quite possible. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=463.18s)]
*  But we have to see what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose very warm words for the president [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=466.94s)]
*  today must have cheered President Trump. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=472.06s)]
*  We'll have to see what Netanyahu decides to do next. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=474.66s)]
*  Matt, did Prime Minister Netanyahu convey any surprise, or did it seem obvious and preordained [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=477.58s)]
*  that Donald Trump would do what he did tonight? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=488.02s)]
*  I would say it didn't look as though he was expressing surprise, but it came very, very [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=492.74s)]
*  quickly after the president's strikes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=497.3s)]
*  And I would say that Prime Minister Netanyahu's body language was, again, as I said, palpably [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  almost excited. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=505.86s)]
*  He almost seemed to be jumping up and down. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=507.12s)]
*  It was that pleased. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  And again, Prime Minister Netanyahu has made a big point of telling the Israeli public [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  that he and only he can extract or wring out concessions from Washington. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=518.58s)]
*  He makes it very clear that through successive presidents and leaders in the United States [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=523.12s)]
*  that Netanyahu is the man for getting the United States to do what Israel wants. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=528.2199999999999s)]
*  He's made this very public. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=533.3s)]
*  And a lot of Israelis that I talk to believe this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=534.7399999999999s)]
*  There was this expectation that the president would weigh in with Israel. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=537.7399999999999s)]
*  Driving down the highway the other day, I saw a bunch of big highway signs, big billboards, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=543.38s)]
*  saying, finish the job, Mr. President, with a big American flag and a picture of President [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=548.54s)]
*  Trump. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=552.78s)]
*  This is something that people are putting on billboards. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=553.78s)]
*  And it was very much a strong feeling that the president should weigh in to help Israel. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=556.06s)]
*  And this is what we heard from Benjamin Netanyahu tonight. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  There was gratitude. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=565.36s)]
*  There was excitement. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=566.54s)]
*  There was a sense of relief for the prime minister, who definitely instigated this war [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=567.9399999999999s)]
*  with Iran and now could be held accountable if he doesn't succeed in his stated goals. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=572.3s)]
*  But there was also this sense that the prime minister really did feel as though he might [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=578.42s)]
*  owe something to President Trump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=584.98s)]
*  You could tell that the gratitude was so deep. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=587.14s)]
*  And again, this is something that's going to vindicate Netanyahu in front of the Israeli [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=591.1s)]
*  public as he has been increasingly blamed for the failures of October 7th. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=594.54s)]
*  Now, with this latest adventure into Iran, it looks as though Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=598.74s)]
*  can turn to the Israeli public and say, I have done what everybody said was a terrible [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=603.14s)]
*  idea for generations. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=609.1800000000001s)]
*  The United States government has regularly been telling Netanyahu, who, by the way, has [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=610.66s)]
*  been pushing for destroying Iran's nuclear program since the early 1990s, the U.S. and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=614.22s)]
*  other leaders have always been telling them, don't do it, step away from the brink, don't [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=619.78s)]
*  attack Iran. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=624.14s)]
*  Well, Israel did. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=625.14s)]
*  And over the past week, its military dominance in Iran has been unquestionable. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=626.64s)]
*  It is almost again, when you talk to Israeli officials, they're extremely and visibly [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=631.0600000000001s)]
*  pleased with how well this attack on Iran has done. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=636.9s)]
*  It has a popularity rate here in Israel, according to a most recent poll of over 80 [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=640.24s)]
*  percent among Jewish Israelis. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=644.3s)]
*  So this was a very popular move. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=646.6s)]
*  And bringing President Trump on board is going to carry huge rewards for Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=653.88s)]
*  But President Trump and his followers are going to have to ask, and they're already [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=654.88s)]
*  asking, what are the rewards for the United States? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=658.28s)]
*  Marjorie Bradley, incredible reporting. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=660.84s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=664.0s)]
*  Stay close to the camera. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=665.24s)]
*  We're grateful to get to talk to you tonight. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=667.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cme0qvq29TQ&t=670.24s)]
