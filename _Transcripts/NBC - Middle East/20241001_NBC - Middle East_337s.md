# Iran launches missile attack against Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M)
*  Hey, Andrea, we are now just hearing reports of sirens across Israel at the moment warning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=0.0s)]
*  of a potential missile launch. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=9.68s)]
*  It's unclear at this point what those sirens are referring to, where the missile has been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=12.46s)]
*  fired from. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=18.76s)]
*  As we await for more information from Israeli officials about potential missile launches, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  we are also hearing from police in Tel Aviv that there has been a suspected terror attack, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=25.84s)]
*  a shooting in Tel Aviv, injuring a number you can hear behind me now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=33.12s)]
*  We are now hearing sirens in Jerusalem as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=37.9s)]
*  I don't know if you can hear that, Andrea, but back to what unfolded just a short while [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=45.56s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, there was a shooting incident. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=46.56s)]
*  We're hearing from this police spokesperson that there were multiple casualties and they [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=48.8s)]
*  suspect that the motive is terror. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=53.32s)]
*  With respect to that incident, we're also hearing from emergency officials in Jaffa, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=56.0s)]
*  which is to the south of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=61.84s)]
*  It seems to be the same attack that they are referring to, that the shooting unfolded at [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=63.68s)]
*  7.01 p.m., that medics and paramedics were in the process of providing medical treatment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=68.92s)]
*  on the spot to a number of injured people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=75.6s)]
*  And, Erin, since every minute counts here, I'm just saying that we now know that we have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=76.6s)]
*  confirmed... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=81.4s)]
*  NBC News has confirmed that missiles have been launched by Iran toward Tel Aviv, toward [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=82.48s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=88.36s)]
*  Iran started. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  Erin, are you getting the same word there? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  We hear the sirens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I'm getting the same word here and I'm hearing the siren sound here in Jerusalem. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=96.84s)]
*  And in the distance, I saw a light rising up into the sky. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  Erin, do you have to get into a shelter? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  I'm not seeing anything else from this vantage point where I am right now, Andrea. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  Erin, do you have to get down into a shelter? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=112.32s)]
*  Yes, we probably should get into a shelter, Andrea. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=113.32s)]
*  Yes, you should. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=114.32s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to go to Matt Bradley in Beirut. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=115.32s)]
*  While you get into a shelter, please get off that roof right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=117.32s)]
*  Matt, pick it up from there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=120.92s)]
*  What is going on in Beirut right now? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=123.24s)]
*  Well, it's not quite as much as what's going on in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=125.28s)]
*  Compared to my colleague Erin Waffelin, I very much hope that she and her team are safe. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=130.56s)]
*  But we have been taking incoming bombardments from the Israelis coming right behind me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=134.72s)]
*  If you can see the skyline here, this is the neighborhood of Dahia, which is a Shiite-majority [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=139.72s)]
*  neighborhood just south of Beirut. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=144.04s)]
*  It's a suburb and it's also a Hezbollah stronghold. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  This is the area where Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, was killed on Friday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=149.0s)]
*  The Israelis continuing to pummel this neighborhood as well as points throughout the country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=153.64s)]
*  And this comes just a couple of hours after we heard from the Israelis that they had launched [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=159.16s)]
*  a ground incursion into Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=163.12s)]
*  And that was the first time they said they had done this, or it sounded like that at [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  the time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=169.56s)]
*  But then since then, we've gotten new news from the Israelis that they've actually been [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=170.56s)]
*  doing this repeatedly for much of the past year, sending in soldiers across the border [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  into Lebanon and using this as reconnaissance maneuvers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=178.56s)]
*  Now, at the same time we heard from Hezbollah, they said that there had been no Israeli incursion [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=182.28s)]
*  and that, in fact, this was all Israeli propaganda. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=186.92s)]
*  They said they had not encountered any Israeli soldiers and had not had a firefight with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=189.88s)]
*  them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=193.56s)]
*  And I can actually sort of hear some concussions now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  It sounds like there's continuing bombing behind me here in Beirut. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=197.84s)]
*  So we are probably not going to be seeing those Iranian missiles that you were just [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=201.96s)]
*  speaking about flying over here in Lebanon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=206.52s)]
*  But there is another interesting element to this, which is other Arab countries, other [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=209.36s)]
*  than our other Middle Eastern countries, other than Iran and Israel, for whom these ballistic [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=213.2s)]
*  missiles are going to be flying over. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=218.24s)]
*  It doesn't sound as though from Courtney Akoubi and my other colleagues in Washington's reporting [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=221.2s)]
*  just in the past couple of hours that the U.S. has shored up the same kind of alliance [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=225.0s)]
*  that it did back in April, including the Jordanians, who they used, who they, the Jordanians helped [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=228.96s)]
*  the Israelis and the United States shooting down those ballistic missiles that were flying [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=234.64s)]
*  over them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=238.5s)]
*  So now we don't know exactly whether or not these missiles are going to be swatted out [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=239.6s)]
*  of the sky so easily. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=243.7s)]
*  Last time it was mostly drones, and now U.S. officials are telling my colleagues in Washington, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  like Courtney Akoubi, Monica Alba and Carol Lee, that in fact more, a higher proportion [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=250.5s)]
*  of the projectiles that are going to be fired, and it sounds like we're just hearing them [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=255.06s)]
*  being fired now, a higher proportion of those are going to be ballistic missiles and not [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=258.94s)]
*  drones. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=263.46s)]
*  And therefore it will be more complicated, more difficult to intercept them, even for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=264.46s)]
*  the Iron Dome. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=269.14s)]
*  In this case, it probably will be more like David's Sling, which is the higher order of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=270.14s)]
*  anti-missile defense or anti-air defense that the Israelis employ. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=274.9s)]
*  The Iron Dome is more for smaller missiles and projectiles fired from Gaza by Hamas. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=279.3s)]
*  David's Sling has a little bit more sophisticated. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=284.26s)]
*  It's for ballistic missiles that tend to be higher in the atmosphere. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=287.86s)]
*  So we can expect the Israeli systems, anti-air systems, are going to be deployed to shoot [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=292.38s)]
*  down a lot of these missiles, whether or not they're going to be as successful as they [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  were last time, back in April, when all 300 of them, with very few exceptions, were shot [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=302.04s)]
*  down and the ones that weren't were allowed to just land almost entirely in empty areas [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=306.68s)]
*  and there were only a few injuries that were recorded. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=311.28s)]
*  This is a situation that could get a lot worse. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDc6kzl40M&t=314.36s)]
