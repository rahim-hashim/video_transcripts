*  I will say that we will continue to have the ability to defend ourselves and to leverage [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihimpj9Gts&t=34.0s)]

*  In fact, there are approximately 1,400 individuals at the Kabul airport who have been screened [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihimpj9Gts&t=52.24s)]

*  evacuees on military airlift out of Afghanistan until the very end. This is a massive military, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihimpj9Gts&t=65.68s)]
*  diplomatic, security and humanitarian undertaking for the United States and our allies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihimpj9Gts&t=73.68s)]
