# Israel taking measures to ‘neutralize threat’ of Syria’s chemical weapons: Israeli Amb. to U.N.
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A)
*  Joining us is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Danny Danon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much for being with us. So, let me ask you about the movement of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=5.2s)]
*  tanks in what is temporary. Is this going to become part of the Golan Heights, which, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=9.76s)]
*  the part that was occupied by Israel in 2019? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=19.36s)]
*  Andrea, thank you for having me today. We are not getting involved in the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=24.72s)]
*  fight within Syria, but we are taking the measures to protect ourselves. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=28.96s)]
*  Those are defensive, temporary measures. And basically what we did, we took over some of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=34.24s)]
*  the posts that were on the border once the Syrian military abandoned them. We will not allow the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Iranians to come back to our borders. We learned the lesson from Lebanon. There was a chaos in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=46.0s)]
*  Lebanon. Iran took advantage of that chaos, and we suffered from it for years. So we are determined [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=50.8s)]
*  not to repeat that mistake. That's why we took those posts, and we will wait to see what's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=57.92s)]
*  happening today in the regime with Syria, whether they are peaceful, like you mentioned earlier, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=63.52s)]
*  or they are radical, like we know from the past of those leaders, that they are not [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=68.08s)]
*  peace-loving leaders. So we will have to be patient about it. We have no intention to stay [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=72.48s)]
*  on those positions forever, but we have to reassure that we don't see radical Iranian groups on our [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  borders again. Now the leader of the rebel group, HDS, has a background years ago in al-Qaeda and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=85.6s)]
*  ISIS. He's on the U.S. and the United Nations terrorist. He's sanctioned. Now he is promising [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=92.8s)]
*  moderation today again and says he will protect women's rights. How is Israel preparing to deal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=99.6s)]
*  with him? Are you prepared to deal with him if he proves to be legitimate? And should the U.S. and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  others take him off the terrorist so that they can get humanitarian aid to Syria and help, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=113.12s)]
*  you know, support him against some of the more radical elements in this coalition? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=119.44s)]
*  Yeah. We will have a first of all to look at the development. We are not sure that there will be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=124.48s)]
*  a central government in Syria. There is a possibility that it will be tribes or different regions, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=130.24s)]
*  and each region will be controlled by somebody else. We have to see how it evolves. And regarding [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  the leader you mentioned, you know, he's a bad guy. He's a bad actor. So let's wait and see. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=141.52s)]
*  He said that he's changed all of a sudden. I'm not sure that is the case, but we will see what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=146.0s)]
*  are the actions that he's taking, the way he treats the Syrians themselves. And it's important [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=150.96s)]
*  to note the Syrians were the ones who suffered the most from the Assad regime over the years, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=155.36s)]
*  since his father took over 54 years ago. And we offer humanitarian support for the Syrians who live [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=160.4s)]
*  next to the Golan Heights. We will continue to reach our hands to them to support [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=166.64s)]
*  those humanitarian needs. But at the end of the day, no one can tell you today and where, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=171.44s)]
*  whether Syria will be a peaceful nation or it's going to be chaotic, like Yemen or Lebanon. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  And Israel has been striking Assad's stockpiles of weapons, chemical weapons, rockets, missiles. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=182.32s)]
*  Do you think you have control over those chemical weapons which have been [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=188.16s)]
*  of such grave concern to the U.S. and to the world? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=192.16s)]
*  Well, that's a real concern because over the years, both Russia and Iran [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=195.84s)]
*  supplied Syria with heavy ammunition, with technology, chemical weapons. That's scary. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=200.32s)]
*  Imagine those rebel groups having chemical weapons. So we are taking the measures to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=206.96s)]
*  neutralize that threat. And I believe that we are very successful in that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=212.48s)]
*  But still, it's a large country, 20 million people, many facilities. And we are very worried about [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=217.04s)]
*  the possibility that some kind of weapons or technology will be in the hands of the rebels. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=223.44s)]
*  And we'll find it very fast going into Lebanon and be used by Hezbollah against us. For years, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=229.12s)]
*  Syria was like the transition place for weapons coming from Iran into Lebanon. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  We are determined to stop it. Syria should rebuild itself. It shouldn't work for the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=241.44s)]
*  Iranians anymore. And there are negotiations now, including Turkey now, with Hamas. President-elect [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=245.6s)]
*  Trump has said he wants Hamas to release the hostages before he takes office. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=252.08s)]
*  Are Trump representatives playing any kind of meaningful role [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=256.72s)]
*  in trying to get some concessions from Hamas? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=260.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, we are very hopeful. It's been too long. We are talking about [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=263.6s)]
*  100 hostages, including children and women, who are being held in horrible conditions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=268.16s)]
*  We don't know how many of them are alive and what is the condition of those who are still alive. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=274.0s)]
*  And yes, there is some movement, but I'm very cautious, because in the past, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=278.96s)]
*  we saw that Hamas was negotiating, but then it disappeared. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=282.8s)]
*  I think the statements of President Trump are helpful. And I think also what's happening [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=286.56s)]
*  today in Syria, in Iran, in Lebanon, it proves to the Hamas that they are isolated. No one is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=290.64s)]
*  going to help them. They have to decide whether they want to die or they want to negotiate with us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frg5le7r-0A&t=296.15999999999997s)]
