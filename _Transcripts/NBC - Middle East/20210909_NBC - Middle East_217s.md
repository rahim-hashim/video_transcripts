# First International Passenger Flight From Kabul Lands In Doha
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8)
*  Welcome back. We've got some breaking news, some good breaking news out of Doha, Qatar, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=0.0s)]
*  where a passenger flight from Kabul just landed. On board, 200 passengers, including American [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=4.64s)]
*  citizens. Why is this a big deal? Because it's the first large-scale international flight [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=9.84s)]
*  to leave Kabul since the U.S. completed its military withdrawal last month. And a Qatari [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=15.36s)]
*  official tells NBC News another flight from Kabul to Doha could take off tomorrow. The [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=20.28s)]
*  U.S. conceded last month that it was not able to evacuate everyone who wanted to leave the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=25.44s)]
*  country by its August 31st deadline. So this is what we're hoping to do to get everybody [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=29.08s)]
*  out. And at least Flight 1 is working. Raf Sanchez is in Doha. He got inside the airport. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=35.96s)]
*  He joins me now. So, Raf, how did this flight come to be? Is this negotiations between our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=40.92s)]
*  State Department and the Taliban? Is this Qatar that made this happen? What can you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=48.4s)]
*  tell us? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  Yeah, Chuck, this is the product of coordination we never thought we'd see between the U.S. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=54.84s)]
*  and the Taliban with the Qataris as the go-between. The Qataris have been instrumental in getting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=61.4s)]
*  Hamid Karzai International Airport up and running again. And as you said, this is the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=66.72s)]
*  first international passenger flight to take off from there since U.S. forces left in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  middle of the night back on August 30th. A few minutes ago, Chuck, we were out on the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=77.68s)]
*  runway here at the airport in Doha. We watched some very tired but very relieved people walking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  down the stairs of that Boeing 777 into the safety and security of Doha after a day that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=88.8s)]
*  began in Taliban-controlled Kabul, passing through an airport controlled by the Taliban, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  the same airport that ISIS-K carried out that suicide bombing at a couple weeks ago. Now, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=103.44s)]
*  people are extremely happy to be here. They are happy to be out of Afghanistan. But nothing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=111.2s)]
*  about this is straightforward, Chuck. We just spoke to a man, a Canadian citizen. He [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=116.48s)]
*  was here with his six-year-old daughter. His wife remains back in Afghanistan. She was [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  not able to get on that flight with them. She is going to try to go through Pakistan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=127.84s)]
*  And the hope is, at some point, through this unbelievable international bureaucracy, this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=134.0s)]
*  family is going to be reunited. Now, for the Biden administration, today is something of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=139.28s)]
*  a vindication. They have been saying they would continue to get both Americans and Afghans [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  out of the country despite not having any U.S. troops there. They've taken a lot of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=152.16s)]
*  heat for that over the last couple of weeks. But they see this flight as proof positive [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  that that formula works. The question is the one you raised. Can this be replicated? Is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=161.76s)]
*  this scalable? And also, given that everybody on this flight that landed today is an international, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  there are Americans, Brits, Ukrainians, Germans, Canadians on this flight, can the same be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  done for those Afghan allies who hold those SIV visas? Will they one day be able to get [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=180.04s)]
*  out on a flight like this, Chuck? I was just going to say, Rob, you just put it really [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=185.88s)]
*  well there, and it's a good way to end our segment, which is the real test is going to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=189.5s)]
*  be if we can get Afghans, the Taliban to let Afghans. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1jojOgm5S8&t=193.28s)]
