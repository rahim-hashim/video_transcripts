# Michael Beschloss Breaks Down Lessons Learned From The Afghanistan War
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns)
*  We continue our breaking coverage of the end of the military operation, the end of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  war in Afghanistan. The Pentagon earlier this hour announcing that the last U.S. troops [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  have left that country. We are awaiting Secretary of State Tony Blinken. He's going to brief [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=11.64s)]
*  reporters on exactly what happens next. That is coming at the top of the hour. That's the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=16.44s)]
*  shot where it will take place as soon as it commences. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=20.76s)]
*  Right now we get to talk to NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss about all of it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=25.08s)]
*  First, your thoughts on the end of a 20-year war in Afghanistan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=31.88s)]
*  It's very sad. As you know better than almost anyone, we came in with noble motives 20 years [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=39.4s)]
*  ago, October of 2001. A desire to punish Afghanistan for having harbored al-Qaeda [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=45.16s)]
*  from its territory was committed, the attacks of 9-11. Then a desire to make [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=55.0s)]
*  Afghanistan some form of a Greek democracy. We spent 20 years doing our best. It didn't work. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Afghanistan was not going to be a Greek democracy. We've learned a lesson from that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=68.12s)]
*  I think the thing today is we have to honor our military heroes, everyone else who risked their [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=73.96s)]
*  lives so that people could live in a more human way in Afghanistan. It hasn't worked in the end, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=79.64s)]
*  but at the same time, I think it's not particularly today a day to question motives. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  Michael Beschloss, we were just learning that President Biden will address the nation tomorrow. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  We heard from General McKenzie, US-Sanctom commander, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  were waiting remarks from Secretary of State Tony Blinken. This White House is engaged in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=104.12s)]
*  meetings at a cabinet level with veterans groups. I wonder what you make of what is a Herculean effort [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  to communicate every step of what you said is a very, very, very challenging [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  sort of end to what's been a challenging war. I know firsthand that the public was weary [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=127.24s)]
*  of this war shortly after it began. This president very much in line with public opinion about [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  ending the war, but very much, I think, still under the Klingites and getting a lot of criticism from [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=140.6s)]
*  national security establishment figures. What do you make of how they're doing and how they're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=147.56s)]
*  communicating? Well, I think they are learning lessons from earlier cases in which we did not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=151.72s)]
*  do this so well. As you know, Nicole, it is a lot harder to end a war than it is to get into one. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson in 1965 was facing the prospect of sending ground troops to Vietnam. He knew in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=164.6s)]
*  private that that might lead to half a million Americans in Vietnam, maybe 50 or 60,000 Americans [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  killed. He knew that in 1965. But in the end, he did not want to bear the incubus of people saying, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=179.48s)]
*  LBJ, you're soft on communism, or you are weak. He was worried it might affect his domestic program, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=187.48s)]
*  that people might not vote for Medicare in Congress if they felt that Johnson was [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  a leader who had let down the cause of freedom in Vietnam. So Johnson made what was in retrospect [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=199.0s)]
*  a bad decision. Joe Biden is not making a decision, obviously, about starting a war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=205.8s)]
*  He's making a decision about ending one. And he may take a lot of political unpopularity from [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=211.08s)]
*  some of the things he has said and done, particularly in the last month. But I think [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  if you look at the Vietnam example, Nicole, Gerald Ford in April of 1975 had to make the decision at [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  the end to pull the plug on Saigon, even though we now know that Richard Nixon had secretly, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=230.2s)]
*  illicitly promised the South Vietnamese government that if the North Vietnamese ever came back into [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  South Vietnam and attacked, we'd go back with air power and we would try to win the war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=242.6s)]
*  So Ford was not making a decision that was preordained. But the point I'm making is this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  When historians look at the war in Afghanistan, yes, they will notice things that happened during [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=254.2s)]
*  the last couple of months that are heavy on our hearts. But at the same time, what they will [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=260.36s)]
*  really pay attention to is the presidents who began and managed this war, President George W. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=265.56s)]
*  Bush, President Obama, President Trump, and then to the extent that Joe Biden has been involved in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=271.56s)]
*  the last couple of months, Joe Biden. And it's going to be a verdict that I think in the end [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=277.8s)]
*  will be this began with noble motives, but you can't conduct a war that Americans do not understand [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=283.48s)]
*  and they do not support. And long before the end of 20 years, that's what happened. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=290.6s)]
*  Joe Biden recognized it. I wonder if you can put this stewardship of this ending of the war in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=296.04s)]
*  Afghanistan next to his attempt to vaccinate a country, 40 percent of which would rather take [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=306.12s)]
*  horse dewormer than an FDA approved vaccine next to what appears like natural disaster after natural [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=313.48s)]
*  disaster after natural disaster because of climate change. I mean, what is the historical [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=320.76s)]
*  parallel for having to manage that those three sort of front burner crises at once? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=326.76s)]
*  That's what presidents do. As you know, Nicole, I mean, President George H.W. Bush had to deal [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  with the invasion of Kuwait at the same time as he was doing budget talks with Congress that led [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=337.4s)]
*  to the raising of taxes. That's how they're paid their salaries. But at the same time, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  I think if you look at what Joe Biden has done, I think he's learned one of the lessons of Vietnam, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  which is our troops were treated horribly when that war ended. In some cases, they were spat [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=354.2s)]
*  upon. They certainly were not given parades. And I know that under Joe Biden, he will make sure that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=361.24s)]
*  all Americans, despite the fact that they listened to presidents a lot less than they did 50 years [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=367.88s)]
*  ago, will honor them as they should. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=372.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9wbHD18Ns&t=390.76s)]
