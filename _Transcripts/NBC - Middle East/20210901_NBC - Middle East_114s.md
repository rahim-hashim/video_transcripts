# Retired General On Afghanistan: 'Have To Demand Dissenting Opinions Get Sunlight'
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y)
*  General, do you think it's more of a, it was almost inertia then? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you think that the sort of, you can't accept the idea that we may be wrong? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=3.24s)]
*  And because no, but by 2009, it's almost too late, 2010, 2011. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=7.76s)]
*  And it sort of, it became a containment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=13.92s)]
*  All of our Afghanistan decisions became a containment policy because nobody wanted to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=16.66s)]
*  be the commander, the politician. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=20.52s)]
*  However, we want to, whichever person we want to put here, no one want to be the one to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=22.52s)]
*  say we were wrong. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=26.76s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=29.680000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if I completely agree with that, that it was just inertia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=30.680000000000003s)]
*  When I got on an airplane in November of 2010, after being there, I seriously, I was optimistic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=35.08s)]
*  I thought, wow, this, I think this is going to work. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=41.0s)]
*  But that was, that was 11 years ago. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=43.28s)]
*  So obviously I was wrong there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=44.88s)]
*  I do think that in the military, there was a culture, which is part of our strength that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  is, okay, I don't care how bad it is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=52.64s)]
*  I've been given a mission and we're going to be successful. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=55.32000000000001s)]
*  So that's what we try to do to carry out the national strategic objective. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=58.64s)]
*  But I think that also, as I look at all of our government institutions, not just in the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=63.28s)]
*  Department of Defense, but in the Department of State, other government agencies, there [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=68.28s)]
*  is a tendency to suppress, bury, kill assessments that are contrary to the prevailing narrative [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  of any administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=83.84s)]
*  The narrative was always going to be our way to get out of Afghanistan was create security [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=85.8s)]
*  forces and governance so they can do it themselves. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=90.52s)]
*  And so experts that said, and you've seen all the reports that came out about corruption [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=93.84s)]
*  in the government and inefficiencies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=100.38s)]
*  We knew this, but I think we've got to encourage and demand that dissenting opinions get sunlight [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=104.16s)]
*  and oxygen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34PVfHV53Y&t=112.88s)]
