# Can Syrian rebel forces form a stable government? 'Have to wait to see', former negotiator says
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg)
*  Joining us now from Jerusalem is NBC News international correspondent Raf Sanchez. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=0.0s)]
*  Raf, I want to start out, what else do we know about these sent com strikes in Syria? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Because this hasn't been something we've been hearing a ton about over the last year. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=8.56s)]
*  And then in the last two weeks, we've heard multiple strikes. How concerned are not only [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=12.64s)]
*  U.S. officials, but Israeli Middle Eastern officials about ISIS coming back in in wake [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=17.44s)]
*  of this kind of power vacuum? Yeah, power vacuum is exactly the right phrase, Christina. There is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=22.64s)]
*  a lot of concern that ISIS will exploit the chaos following the collapse of the Assad regime [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=29.52s)]
*  and try to reassert itself after it was really put on the back foot by the international coalition [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=35.6s)]
*  led by the United States and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. This strike happened [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=40.4s)]
*  in eastern Syria in the province of Deir ez-Zor. Central Command is saying that they saw ISIS [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=48.16s)]
*  operatives moving weapons around on a truck and they carried out the strike. What's interesting, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=53.68s)]
*  Christina, is they are saying that this happened in an area that up until a couple of weeks ago [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=59.12s)]
*  had been controlled by the Assad regime and by their Russian allies. So that is a really [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=63.68s)]
*  good illustration of what you rightly called a power vacuum. A lot of concern about ISIS filling [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=69.52s)]
*  those ungoverned spaces. You have seen over the course of the Biden administration, even though [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=77.12s)]
*  it hasn't got a whole lot of attention, that there is a commitment to trying to make sure that ISIS [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=82.16s)]
*  does not resurge. There are roughly a thousand U.S. service personnel in northeastern Syria. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=88.16s)]
*  Right now there's actually more than that. More have been cycled in. The question is, what is that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=94.8s)]
*  going to look like, that deployment under the Trump administration? We know that Trump in his first [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=101.28s)]
*  term did try to pull those American forces out of Syria. He said Syria is blood and sand. He did not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=107.52s)]
*  have a whole lot of interest in having American personnel in harm's way. And one of the big [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=114.8s)]
*  questions is, what will his policy look like once he takes office on January 20th? Christina? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  All right, Raph, hang on just a second because I want to introduce Aaron David Miller, who's a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=126.64s)]
*  senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for the International Peace and of course the former U.S. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=130.32s)]
*  State Department Arab-Israeli negotiator. Aaron, I'm wondering, I want to get your take on Syria's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  new leadership. You know, we kind of saw this in Kabul where this new group rolled in, made all [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=140.8s)]
*  these promises, and then didn't hold them up. But, you know, he's meeting with officials, he's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  wearing suits, he's saying all the right things. Is it possible that they could actually pull off [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=150.56s)]
*  a functional government or is it just too soon to tell? You know, it's a fascinating question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=155.44s)]
*  Things are having me. There's no precedent when Arab authoritarians are overthrown, whether it's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=160.08s)]
*  Egypt or Tunisia or Libya or Yemen. It either leads to more repression on one hand or chaotic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=165.68s)]
*  dysfunction and division, particularly in a country like Yemen or Libya or even in Iraq. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=171.84s)]
*  It's going to be a very heavy lift. I mean, the central question is, can an Islamist movement that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=178.72s)]
*  is highly decentralized with authoritarian tendencies govern a country that is multi-confessional, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  multi-ethnic, that has high expectations for a transparent participatory form of government that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=191.68s)]
*  benefits the Syrian people who have suffered so extraordinarily under five decades of rule of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=201.68s)]
*  the Assad family? That's the question. I mean, at this stage, no paths, no A, no B, no C. I think [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=208.88s)]
*  it's incomplete. And I think we're simply going to have to wait to see whether Ahmad Shahra, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=216.08s)]
*  who wants to be a kingmaker, a terribly ambitious individual, can shed those authoritarian [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  and Islamist strict practices and adjust and adapt to what the Syrian public and the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=229.2s)]
*  international community remember. He's still designated as, HTS is still designated as a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=235.52s)]
*  foreign terrorist organization and Syria probably the most heavily sanctioned country in the world [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=241.2s)]
*  after Russia and North Korea. So he's got to deliver and he's got to at least walk the walk [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=246.88s)]
*  and talk the talk. We'll see if it lasts. I did think it was interesting that after meeting with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  U.S. officials, they did take down Al Jelani's rewards for justice because you mentioned this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  was designated a terrorist organization, but that page, when you go to click on it now, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  is no longer there. It's been taken down. Raf, I want to ask you, how is this all being viewed [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=267.52s)]
*  not only in Israel but by regional partners? Are they also suspicious? Are they hopeful? What [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=273.84s)]
*  are you hearing from people in your part of the world? I think it's a wait and see approach, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=279.2s)]
*  exactly as Aaron was saying. There is not a bright history of the replacements of these [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  Middle Eastern dictators proving to be, you know, liberal Democrats themselves. But we will wait and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  see. And Ahmad Shahra is certainly, from the perspective of the United States, making the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=298.0s)]
*  right noises, saying that he will not impinge on the rights of minorities, of women, that he does [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=303.12s)]
*  not intend Syria to be a threat to any of its neighbors, including Israel. Based on his [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=310.0s)]
*  ideological backgrounds, this is someone who is a Sunni Islamist. He was part of al-Qaeda. You can [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=316.8s)]
*  probably bet he's no fan of Israel, but he certainly is not making threats at this point, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=323.2s)]
*  even given these intensive Israeli strikes we've seen over the last few weeks, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  the fact that Israel has sent forces to occupy that UN-designated buffer zone in between Israeli [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=334.24s)]
*  and Syrian positions on the Golan Heights, and then actually advanced further, taking strategic [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  positions inside of Syria. Bigger picture, the fall of the Assad regime is the loss of a major, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=345.12s)]
*  link in the Iranian chain, its so-called Axis resistance. Syria was the absolutely key [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=354.48s)]
*  funnel point for Iranian weapons making their way to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. And so we are [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=362.32s)]
*  seeing Iran's proxy groups weakened from Hamas to Hezbollah. The Assad regime collapsed. The [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=369.12s)]
*  Iranian government itself feeling very vulnerable after Israel destroyed a lot of their key air [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=375.36s)]
*  defenses around Tehran in strikes earlier this year. Interestingly, Christina, one of the proxy [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=380.56s)]
*  groups that is still defiant and apparently totally undeterred are the Houthis down in Yemen, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=386.8s)]
*  who just in the last week have fired two ballistic missiles that broke through Israeli air defenses [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=392.0s)]
*  and actually struck targets inside of Tel Aviv. Christina? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=397.2s)]
*  Christina Also trying to take credit for that accidental U.S. friendly fire incident with that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=400.64s)]
*  down fighter jet. Aaron, I want to ask you really quickly before we go, Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=405.44s)]
*  who said that progress is being made in a ceasefire deal, which would hopefully stop [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=410.16s)]
*  the conflict in Gaza and bring some of these hostages home. But we've heard this before. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  We've been hearing it for months. Do you think this time is any different? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu You know, I think it demonstrates that, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  in my experience, that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations really have only two speeds, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=424.8s)]
*  is slow and slower. I do believe that a deal now is more likely than we've seen over the course [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  of the last year. One of the key stumbling blocks is, can Hamas come up with a list? Do they want [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=435.84s)]
*  to come up with a list of hostages who are living? Because the fewer there are, the less leverage [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  Hamas is going to have in phase two of these negotiations. But I think it's reasonable to assume [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=449.12s)]
*  that by January 20, you can see a limited release. Women, maybe some men, the elderly, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  the infirm, in exchange for a badly needed 45 to 60-degrees fire. Certainly for the hostages, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=462.8s)]
*  their families, and for the people of Gaza, this will be an extraordinary moment and new year. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=469.68s)]
*  A.D. All right. Raf Sanchez, Eric David Miller, thank you both very much. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv2xIAXOheg&t=476.40000000000003s)]
