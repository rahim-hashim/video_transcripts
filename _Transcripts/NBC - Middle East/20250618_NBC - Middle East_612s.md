# 'Nobody knows what I'm going to do': Trump foreign policy on display
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8)
*  It is day 150 of the second Trump administration, and it has been nearly a week of escalating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=0.0s)]
*  conflict in the Middle East. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Tonight, Israel's military says it hit nuclear weapon development sites inside Tehran, and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=8.16s)]
*  President Trump is considering, he is considering whether to order U.S. forces to join these [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=13.8s)]
*  strikes on Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=19.1s)]
*  He met with his advisers again tonight in the Situation Room, and here's what he told [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=20.32s)]
*  reporters about the possibilities ahead. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=24.48s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=28.84s)]
*  I've been saying it for a long time, and I think they were a few weeks away from having [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=30.12s)]
*  one. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=34.28s)]
*  I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, you know, because things [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=35.28s)]
*  change, I mean, especially with war. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=38.28s)]
*  I may do it, I may not do it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=42.0s)]
*  I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=43.44s)]
*  And I say, why didn't you negotiate with me before? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=50.96s)]
*  All this death. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=53.2s)]
*  The next week is going to be very big, maybe less than a week, maybe less. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=54.2s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports last night the president told senior aides he approved [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=58.92s)]
*  attack plans for Iran, but he had not given the final order because he was waiting to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=63.24s)]
*  see if Iran would abandon its nuclear program. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=67.48s)]
*  That is according to three people familiar with the deliberations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=69.9s)]
*  And earlier today, the president did not rule out renewed negotiations after he said Iran [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=73.28s)]
*  proposed a meeting at the White House. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=78.32s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=80.08s)]
*  Iran's government denied that very claim, and their supreme leader rejected Trump's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=81.64s)]
*  call for the country's, quote, unconditional surrender. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=85.72s)]
*  And he did that via state TV. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=89.0s)]
*  Well, over on social media, Iran threatened the U.S. military with irreparable damage [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=90.88s)]
*  if we enter the war. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=96.52s)]
*  The U.S. has already started moving additional assets into the Middle East region, where [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=97.96s)]
*  40,000 troops are already stationed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=102.64s)]
*  So the big question tonight, how close are we to war? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  With that, let's bring in our nightcap. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=110.08s)]
*  Tim O'Brien joins us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=111.6s)]
*  Bloomberg opinion, senior executive editor and Trump biographer, foreign policy expert [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=112.6s)]
*  Hagar Shamali. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  She was the Syria and Lebanon director at the White House and was with the National [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=118.0s)]
*  Security Council for the first two years of the Syria crisis. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=121.6s)]
*  And Mark McKinnon is here, former senior adviser to both George W. Bush and John McCain. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=125.0s)]
*  Hagar, let's start right there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=130.32s)]
*  Put it into context, how close are we to entering this conflict? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=133.72s)]
*  It's certainly something that President Trump wants to convey. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=138.84s)]
*  He wants this inconsistent messaging that you're seeing, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=141.76s)]
*  There's a lot of bellicose. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of this rhetoric that's very loud, you know, telling people in Tehran to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  evacuate, saying that the Iranian regime needs this unconditional surrender. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=149.76s)]
*  I believe ultimately that he wants a deal and he wants to use this rhetoric and this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  moment in order to force the regime, given how weak it is, given how much they could [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  they could crumble if their nuclear program is completely obliterated, the threat that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=167.32s)]
*  they face that they could collapse. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=172.16s)]
*  And he wants to use that to force a deal ultimately. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=174.12s)]
*  And that's why he wants that inconsistent messaging. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, that tends to work usually with adversaries. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=179.2s)]
*  You don't want adversaries. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  You don't want to lay out all of your options or plans that, oh, I'm going to start with [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  plan A and then move to B and so on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=187.12s)]
*  You don't want your adversary when you're dealing with a dictator like this to know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=188.82s)]
*  all that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  But that said, he is very seriously considering joining strikes against Florida. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=193.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=198.42s)]
*  That's what we're talking about here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=199.42s)]
*  This isn't where it's not something where he's talking about deploying troops across [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=200.72s)]
*  Iran, war that's similar to Iraq or Afghanistan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=206.26s)]
*  I've heard this comparison many times. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  And that's not what this is about. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=211.1s)]
*  This is a situation that would look like specific attacks, limited military engagement, something [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=212.9s)]
*  that's more similar to the attacks you saw against Hezbollah by Israel in the last fall. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=220.3s)]
*  But he's not the only one driving things here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=227.12s)]
*  Has Netanyahu boxed Trump into a corner or at least into forcing him to make a decision? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  I think he's driving Trump like a truck. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  And I think this notion that Trump is a peacenake is pure mythology. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  That has always been for political, that worked for him politically to be opposed to say, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=242.46s)]
*  But that's not really who he is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=248.82s)]
*  He loves military strength. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=250.42s)]
*  He loves strongmen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=251.98s)]
*  Why do you think he likes a military parade going down? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=252.98s)]
*  He talks about shooting protesters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  He loves aggression. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=257.78s)]
*  He loves offense. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=258.78s)]
*  And I think what's happened here, I think he's already committed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=259.94s)]
*  I think he's already there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=262.62s)]
*  I mean, the Tulsi Gabbard tell was a real tell. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=264.18s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in a sec. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  And so I just think that, and also I think that Bibi has played him, as I said, drove [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  because I think Bibi has been leaning on and saying, this is for history. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=275.74s)]
*  We're going to remake the Middle East and you can either be part of it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=280.34s)]
*  And I think that Trump has seen a bunch of the initial success and it's like, oh, shit, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  I want to be part of that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=288.74s)]
*  I have a different thought about all this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=292.26s)]
*  I think routinely when Donald Trump says, I'm not sure what I'm thinking and I may not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=293.9s)]
*  let you know to the last minute, it is not strategy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=300.62s)]
*  And it is not Donald Trump playing 3D chess. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=303.82s)]
*  Donald, it is the fact that Donald Trump is ignorant. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=306.34s)]
*  He authentically doesn't know. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=309.74s)]
*  I think he'd be hard pressed to find most countries on a map. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=311.5s)]
*  And I think what's happened with Iran is he went into it wanting to appease his political [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=315.02s)]
*  base, which did not want the U.S. intervening in foreign theaters and certainly not engaging [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=320.3s)]
*  in war again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=326.46s)]
*  And he got up to the point about a week ago saying he'd like to engage in talks and lead [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=328.46s)]
*  talks to find a peace deal in Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  And Bibi drove through that statement with a truck. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=337.86s)]
*  He began shelling Iran. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=341.26s)]
*  And then Israel, as it has, reordered the map in the Middle East since October of 2023, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  first with Hezbollah, then with Syria, and now with Iran. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=349.66s)]
*  Extraordinated display of military and intelligence prowess. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=353.86s)]
*  He defenestrated Iran's air defenses far faster than anyone thought they could. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=358.82s)]
*  And Trump sees this success. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=364.78s)]
*  And he wants some credit for it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=366.78s)]
*  He wants credit for it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=367.78s)]
*  He begins saying, we did this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=368.78s)]
*  After Israel had those very skilled strikes and everybody was complimenting, he went, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=370.38s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, I was in the game. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=373.98s)]
*  Yeah, and it's we. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  Suddenly it became, you know, we did this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's because Trump is not a strategist. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=380.18s)]
*  Trump doesn't know anything other than playing to the audience he sees directly in front [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  of him on a day to day basis. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=387.58s)]
*  And because the ground game had shifted and Israel had pulled off this extraordinary action [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=389.34s)]
*  in Iran, he wanted to be part of it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=395.46s)]
*  And he forgot that that's not what his base wants. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=397.94s)]
*  So now he's fomented. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=400.62s)]
*  You know, he's now he's in a cat fight with Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz is getting raked [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=402.18s)]
*  over the coals by Tucker Carlson. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=406.97999999999996s)]
*  And all of this is very palmal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=410.34s)]
*  Donald Trump does not know what he's doing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=412.14s)]
*  He's surrounded by advisors who don't know what they're doing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=414.14s)]
*  This has already happened with economic policy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=417.38s)]
*  It's happened with immigration policy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=419.78s)]
*  It's now happening with foreign policy because this is a man who's a performance artist. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=421.56s)]
*  He's not a strategist. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=427.02s)]
*  And it's that's a dangerous place to unite. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=429.02s)]
*  Well, what he's publicly saying is he is not looking for a long term war in any way. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=430.73999999999995s)]
*  The goal is to just prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=435.38s)]
*  But I just want to play a clip from former NATO commander. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=439.62s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=443.29999999999995s)]
*  I don't think it's wise to go into war without knowing how it's going to end. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=444.3s)]
*  We have maximum diplomatic leverage and you absolutely have to know where you're going [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=452.82s)]
*  in something like this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  You don't just take one step forward and say, now let's look around. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  We're a little bit deeper in this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=463.22s)]
*  Now what? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  That's what Rumsfeld did in Iraq. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  And how did that work out? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=468.22s)]
*  We did this in Libya with Obama. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=469.82s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=471.94s)]
*  Do you see a military or diplomatic strategy being laid out or believe there's even one [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=475.06s)]
*  behind the scenes? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=479.86s)]
*  Well, the bright line that Donald Trump's laying out is that he wants to ensure that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=480.86s)]
*  there's no nuclear capability. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=484.14s)]
*  Well, if he if you believe what Tulsi Gabbard said, they're not there yet. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=486.02s)]
*  But Bibi is convinced that they are. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=490.96s)]
*  And the only way to address that is to destroy with the bunker busting bomb, which only the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=493.74s)]
*  Americans can provide. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  And then where are you? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's that's the only way to do it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  If that's what Trump says is the bright line, that's the only way to achieve it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  And that means American. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=508.29999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=509.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, then let's just explain this to our audience because NBC is reporting that Tulsi [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=510.29999999999995s)]
*  Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, has now been sidelined. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  Back in March, she told Congress that Iran was not building a nuclear bomb. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=518.18s)]
*  That is what Marcus talked about. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=522.6999999999999s)]
*  And now we are confirmed that that assessment hasn't changed. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=523.98s)]
*  But yesterday, the president said he does not care what she says. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=527.38s)]
*  He is not following her or any other intelligence. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=531.02s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=534.26s)]
*  He's just basing his decision on what Netanyahu was telling him. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=535.5s)]
*  This is what Netanyahu wants. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=539.42s)]
*  It's not what Netanyahu is telling me. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=540.42s)]
*  It's what the IAEA has has deduced. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  So and this is where I've noticed there's a little bit this thread has been lost a little [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=544.8599999999999s)]
*  bit. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=548.3399999999999s)]
*  And and that's because Netanyahu is usually the one that's loudest. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  But for the last several years, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, by the way, during [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=551.5799999999999s)]
*  the deal said during the JCPOA had said, oh, Iran is in compliance and so on. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=555.92s)]
*  But since then, since since the withdrawal of that deal and now that Iran has been further [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=560.84s)]
*  enriching uranium to weapons grade level, they have been sounding the alarm for years. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=565.4s)]
*  But no one's really been paying attention to it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  And then back in May, just now, I mean, a month ago, the IAEA put out a report saying [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=571.8s)]
*  that Iran had surged its its enrichment of weapons grade uranium by 50 percent and that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=576.52s)]
*  it had enough uranium for 10 nuclear weapons. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=582.92s)]
*  That's coming from the IAEA. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=585.56s)]
*  The same one that everyone said, oh, but Iran is in compliance. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=586.56s)]
*  And so that's the thing that we have to point out. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtvBAC0Rc8&t=590.4s)]
