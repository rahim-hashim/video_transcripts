Video Description: New reporting shows that Iran has expanded its nuclear program, reducing the time it would need to build a nuclear bomb if it chose to, and possessing enough material to theoretically construct two nuclear weapons. Ali Velshi explains how Trump’s decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal resulted in the dangerous ripple effects we’re seeing today, including increased regional aggression and pushing Iranian hardliners to the front of the regime.

# The Art of Tanking a Deal: The dangerous cost of Trump withdrawing from Iran nuclear deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA)
*  For about six years now, Iran has been expanding and accelerating its nuclear program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been reducing the amount of time until it has a nuclear weapon capability if that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=6.32s)]
*  regime chooses that route. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=10.76s)]
*  According to the UN nuclear watchdog that inspects Iran's enrichment plans, Iran is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=13.24s)]
*  now enriching uranium to up to 60% purity. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=17.52s)]
*  And according to the International Atomic Energy Agency's definition, that means Iran [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=21.0s)]
*  Iran has enough material theoretically for two nuclear weapons. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=25.86s)]
*  And what's even more concerning is that as Reuters reports, that means Iran's so-called [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=30.82s)]
*  breakout time, the time it would need to produce enough weapons, grave uranium for a nuclear [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=35.42s)]
*  bomb is close to zero, likely a matter of weeks or days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=40.54s)]
*  Now you might be thinking to yourself a nuclear armed Iran could pose such a threat to so [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  many countries. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=50.28s)]
*  The answer is they did. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=51.72s)]
*  We did. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=59.36s)]
*  And it was working until the United States under Donald Trump and under immense pressure [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=60.8s)]
*  from Benjamin Netanyahu, let it fall apart. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=65.12s)]
*  That mechanism was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the JCPOA, or more commonly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=68.78s)]
*  known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=76.66s)]
*  In 2015, after nearly a decade of negotiations, the US, UK, China, France, Russia, Germany, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=80.0s)]
*  they signed on to the JCPOA, which loosened sanctions on Iran in exchange for strict limits [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=86.26s)]
*  on the country's nuclear program. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=94.1s)]
*  The goal of the deal was to prevent Iran from reviving its nuclear weapons program, but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=96.62s)]
*  the agreement did even more than that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  It opened up a line of communication between the signatories of the deal and Iran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=103.4s)]
*  The JCPOA was a multilateral diplomacy tool which helped reduce the prospects of conflict [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=109.46s)]
*  between Iran and its rivals in the region. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=115.66s)]
*  It's widely considered one of President Obama's most important international diplomacy achievements. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  And for all intents and purposes, the deal was working. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=124.69999999999999s)]
*  In 2016 and 2017, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran had met [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=127.82s)]
*  its preliminary pledges agreeing not to produce uranium to the point of nuclear enrichment. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=133.86s)]
*  But in 2018, President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement, unraveling the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=140.22000000000003s)]
*  deal, rendering it ineffective and causing a ripple effect for years to come. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=146.78s)]
*  Trump called the deal, quote, rotten and one-sided, and he reinstated devastating banking and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=151.78000000000003s)]
*  oil sanctions on Iran, which crippled its economy once again. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=157.58s)]
*  Iran and all the other signatories to the deal kept their part of the bargain. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=163.58s)]
*  America didn't. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=169.94000000000003s)]
*  So, in 2019, Iran began enriching uranium at higher levels and developed new centrifuges [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=170.94000000000003s)]
*  for uranium enrichment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=177.5s)]
*  And last year, United Nations inspectors found that Iran was enriching uranium to close to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=179.18s)]
*  weapons-grade levels. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=185.38000000000002s)]
*  But Iran's escalations exploded beyond nuclear development. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  That's evident in what's happening in the Middle East right now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=192.1s)]
*  The Iranian regime and its proxy groups have increased their regional aggression. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=194.62s)]
*  Iran-backed militias have continued to help fuel insurgencies and civil wars in Syria [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=199.26s)]
*  and Yemen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  Iran is now more embattled and it is more emboldened. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=205.9s)]
*  Moderates who existed within the Iranian government when the 2015 nuclear deal was signed are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=210.26s)]
*  gone. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=215.18s)]
*  In 2020, a new hardline Iranian parliament was sworn in, while already existing domestic [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=216.18s)]
*  politics had a lot to do with Iran's shift in government. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=221.5s)]
*  Many experts say Trump pulling America out of the deal pushed the hardliners to the front [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=226.06s)]
*  of the Iranian regime. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=230.8s)]
*  And all of this made it nearly impossible for President Biden to undo the damage. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=233.5s)]
*  When Biden came into power, negotiating with Iran was basically hopeless. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=239.28s)]
*  But it wasn't for lack of trying. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=242.94s)]
*  For the first year of Biden's presidency, his administration attempted to resurrect [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=244.9s)]
*  the 2015 nuclear deal, but Tehran refused to engage directly with U.S. diplomats. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=248.76s)]
*  Talks have now been stop and go for several years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  Iran has long been a dominant power in the Middle East and beyond. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=258.3s)]
*  The regime's influence reaches corners of international conflict you may have never [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=261.84s)]
*  even heard of. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=265.64s)]
*  Not to mention, Iran has some powerful friends in countries that the rest of the world considers [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=266.64s)]
*  foes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  Russia, China, North Korea, three malevolent actors with nuclear power. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  The 2015 Iran nuclear deal built at least some good faith between Iran and the West. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=278.88s)]
*  It created an avenue for discussion, an avenue for diplomacy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=284.2s)]
*  Without it, America has no negotiating partner across the table, either to help settle Israel's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=287.52s)]
*  war with Hamas or to bring down the temperature between Israel and Iran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRF2pROyGA&t=292.58s)]
