# Rep. Jason Crow On Afghanistan Withdrawal: 'Deadline Has Got To Extend'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E)
*  Joining us now to continue the conversation is Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crowe. He [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=0.0s)]
*  is an Afghanistan war veteran. He sits on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=5.12s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for being here today. I know that you've been a leader in the effort [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=10.32s)]
*  to help Afghans who worked with the U.S., who worked with coalition forces. What more do you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=14.48s)]
*  think the Biden administration should be doing to help these people get out of Afghanistan? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  REP. JASON CROE, California Department of Defense Secretary General's Office of Defense [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=25.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. It's very simple. As some of your guests have already pointed out, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=27.6s)]
*  one is, this deadline has got to extend. There's just no way that we get the people out who we [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  need to get out between now and the end of the month. It's just not going to happen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=37.84s)]
*  And anybody who says that it could happen, I understand the military is doing all of it [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  the best they can. They're doing a remarkable job, by the way, under extreme circumstances. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=45.2s)]
*  But they're just not going to be able to make that happen. So, that deadline needs to extend. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=49.2s)]
*  We need to extend the security perimeter out beyond the airport. And we probably need to put [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=52.4s)]
*  additional forces in the ground to make sure that we're securing and have proper security for the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=57.92s)]
*  airport and the surrounding areas as well. So, those are the things that need to happen in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=62.0s)]
*  near term. In the long term, of course, we need to make sure that, legislatively, we're looking at [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=65.2s)]
*  an extension of the SIV program, the federal immigrant visas, adding more, expediting the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=70.56s)]
*  processing of those visas, making sure that we have proper benefits and support for those folks [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=76.4s)]
*  as they come to the United States. Well, Congressman, do you think the Taliban is just [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=81.2s)]
*  blowing smoke? If, as they talk about there being a red line on that August 31st date, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=84.72s)]
*  is that something that doesn't concern you? And you think extend that deadline as far as the U.S. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  is concerned, do what needs to be done and worry about the Taliban later? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=94.16s)]
*  Well, I think that if there's anybody that tells you that they know certainly what the Taliban is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=98.08s)]
*  going to do one way or the other, they either are lying to themselves or lying to others. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=101.92s)]
*  Nobody really knows. That's the bottom line. Because the Taliban, let's not forget, the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Taliban is not a cohesive, singular group. It's a conglomeration of groups. There are little [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=110.48s)]
*  fiefdoms. There are warlords. There are different groups. There's the Haqqani Network. The Taliban [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=115.76s)]
*  have their own challenges of maintaining cohesion throughout the country. So we can't rely on any [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  of their promises. We just have to do what's necessary to get American citizens out, to get [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=128.56s)]
*  our Afghan partners out, and put the troops on the ground and the resources in country to make [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=133.28s)]
*  sure that we're doing that regardless of what the Taliban say or don't say. Now, it is important [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=138.64s)]
*  that we try to maintain an open line of communication and do the best that we can, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=144.0s)]
*  which I think the administration is, of keeping the Taliban leadership, at least those in Kabul, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=147.44s)]
*  cooperating with the evacuation operations, which more or less seems to be happening right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=154.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mentioned that you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=158.64s)]
*  scheduled to get a briefing, a classified briefing on the situation a little bit later this evening. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=161.44s)]
*  What do you hope to learn from that briefing today, and what questions do you still have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=166.48s)]
*  for the Biden administration about how this withdrawal has unfolded? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, the immediate question is about security on the ground. The Taliban are not the only concern [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=175.28s)]
*  here. ISIS, the Haqqani Network, there's a number of bad actors and terrorist threats that we have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=180.88s)]
*  to look at very closely to make sure we're protecting our troops, but also protecting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  the Afghans who are swarming and camped out around the airport right now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=190.96s)]
*  So force protection is priority one, two, and three over the next one to two weeks as we conduct [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=195.28s)]
*  this evacuation operation. So we want to make sure that we are looking at every conceivable [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=200.8s)]
*  aspect of that challenge. And then we're going to have time later to look at what happened and what [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=206.0s)]
*  was potentially missed. But I also want to be clear about something else here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=211.12s)]
*  I have spent most of today actually reviewing intelligence, historical intelligence. I flew [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=214.72s)]
*  into D.C. last week and did the same. And I am not seeing right now the indicators of an [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=220.8s)]
*  intelligence failure. An intelligence failure means something very specific. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing some warning signs. I'm seeing streams of information that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=233.12s)]
*  could have led us to believe that this is the position we would be in. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=237.68s)]
*  So I think we have to be very careful about the language we use and the conclusions we're coming [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  to. And we'll have time to go through the hearings and conduct a postmortem to determine how we got [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  to this point when over the last six months there were some warning signals that would [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=250.08s)]
*  indicate that this was going to be the situation that we're dealing with right now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=254.72s)]
*  Congressman Jason Crowe, Congressman, we appreciate your time today. Thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=263.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkk-DfaHJ_E&t=280.08s)]
