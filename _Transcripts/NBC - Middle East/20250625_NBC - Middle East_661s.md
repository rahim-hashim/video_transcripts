# Trump questions initial Defense Dept. intel report on Iran nuclear program
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo)
*  It is day 157 of the second Trump administration and tonight the president is doubling, tripling, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=0.0s)]
*  basically quadrupling down on his claim that Iran's nuclear sites were obliterated. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=6.72s)]
*  After an early assessment from the United States Defense Intelligence Agency, they said [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  the program was likely only set back about three to six months. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=16.64s)]
*  Our own Kelly O'Donnell is traveling with the president in the Netherlands and she brings [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  us all the details. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=23.96s)]
*  Working with the leaders of the NATO alliance today and confronting global media. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=27.04s)]
*  President Trump came armed with his own battle damage assessments of U.S. airstrikes on Iran's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=38.8s)]
*  It was very, very successful. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=39.8s)]
*  It was called obliteration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=42.84s)]
*  The president pushing back after news reports that the Defense Intelligence Agency, in an [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=45.04s)]
*  initial assessment, said the Iranian nuclear program was set back three to six months, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  according to three sources. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=54.4s)]
*  That preliminary analysis based on Intel gathered 24 hours after the strikes, one of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=56.22s)]
*  the sources told us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=61.14s)]
*  Pressed today, the president acknowledged the report's findings but described it as [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=62.7s)]
*  premature. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=67.02s)]
*  They presented a report that wasn't finished. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=68.02s)]
*  They didn't see it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=70.22s)]
*  All they can do is take a guess. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=71.78s)]
*  Do you have a message for the intelligence community though in terms of unvarnished information [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=73.02s)]
*  getting to you? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=77.86s)]
*  I would say issue the report when you know what happened. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=78.86s)]
*  I wouldn't say that it could be severe or maybe not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=82.06s)]
*  You're not disputing the report said what it said even though it was initial. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=84.78s)]
*  The report said what it said and it was fine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=89.34s)]
*  It was severe, they think, but they had no idea. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=91.94s)]
*  They shouldn't have issued a report until they did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=95.02s)]
*  He called on Defense Secretary Hegseth to make the cases well, who noted the Defense [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=97.42s)]
*  Intelligence Agency had low confidence in its initial assessment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=101.86s)]
*  Why is there low confidence? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=105.94s)]
*  Because all of the evidence of what was just bombed by 12, 30,000-pound bombs is buried [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=107.66s)]
*  under a mountain, devastated and obliterated. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=114.22000000000001s)]
*  So if you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordow, you better get a big shovel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=117.54s)]
*  and go really deep because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=122.62s)]
*  The president cited foreign intelligence, including Israel's Atomic Energy Commission. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=127.34s)]
*  Today saying the strikes set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  And this from Iran's foreign ministry. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=138.5s)]
*  Our nuclear installations have been badly damaged. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=141.62s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=146.58s)]
*  Late tonight, the CIA director saying credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=147.98s)]
*  has been severely damaged and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=153.34s)]
*  The ceasefire between Iran and Israel is holding for a second day. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=158.82s)]
*  NATO Secretary General praising President Trump for that agreement and made a notable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=163.98s)]
*  comment when the president compared Israel and Iran to squabbling kids. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=167.9s)]
*  They fight like hell. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=173.02s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=174.5s)]
*  Let them fight for about two, three minutes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=175.5s)]
*  Then it's easy to stop them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=178.82s)]
*  You have to use strong language. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  Every once in a while you have to use a certain word. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  With that, let's bring in our nightcap and they've got their work cut out for them tonight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  Nayyar Ahak is here, former White House senior director and former State Department senior [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  advisor. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=193.86s)]
*  David Gura joins us, correspondent for Bloomberg, host of the Big Take podcast. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=195.74s)]
*  He's just returning from the Bluegrass Festival in Telluride, so we're glad to have him back. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=202.06s)]
*  Stuart Stevens is here, a veteran of the Mitt Romney and George W. Bush presidential campaigns. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=206.46s)]
*  Now with the Lincoln Project and David Litt, former presidential speechwriter and author [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  of the new book, It's Only Drowning, a true story of learning to surf and the pursuit [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=215.74s)]
*  of common ground. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  It is David's first visit to the 11th hour, so good luck to you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=222.1s)]
*  Nayyar, let's start with you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=225.94s)]
*  I want to be clear that we do not know the state of Iran's nuclear program, but what [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=227.94s)]
*  is your takeaway after what we learned today or what we heard today? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=233.9s)]
*  I'm just fascinated by the idea that the NATO secretary general was playing into Trump's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=237.54s)]
*  ego and calling him daddy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=244.38s)]
*  That wasn't the quote of the summit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=246.74s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=248.38s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=249.38s)]
*  For our audience, wait, wait, wait. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=250.38s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  We need to clarify that because he clarified it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  He didn't call him daddy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=254.98s)]
*  He said it was like a toddler answering to daddy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=256.82s)]
*  He wasn't calling president daddy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=261.5s)]
*  So I just want to make sure for his sake, we clarify that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=263.88s)]
*  Fair point. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=270.06s)]
*  Fair point. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=271.06s)]
*  But I will say, Steph, it does go to this broader idea of these countries, our NATO [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=272.06s)]
*  allies really having to cater to Trump's ego and making him feel very good about this attack [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  and Trump himself deeply uncomfortable with some of the facts, some of which are murky [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  around how successful these strikes were. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=288.06s)]
*  Yes, they were successful to the degree that they landed, that they helped destroy the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=290.74s)]
*  top level of surface area. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  But we really, truly don't know how far deep they went and how much of the infrastructure [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  is still there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=303.26s)]
*  We don't know how much of the enriched uranium was disappeared in the days prior. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=304.3s)]
*  So that's the stuff that takes time to figure out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=309.62s)]
*  And yes, we have to work with multiple different intelligence sources. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=312.82s)]
*  But Trump just seems committed to this narrative of immediate and total success. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=316.14s)]
*  And that's where we could potentially end up in trouble as a country, along with our [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=320.7s)]
*  allies, is this idea that the story is more important than the reality because negotiations [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=325.18s)]
*  take time and it takes discipline. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=330.86s)]
*  It takes a given take. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  It takes understanding that the other side also needs something so they can walk away [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  and tell their public that this is a good deal for them as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=339.82s)]
*  And that's where I start to get worried with the bravado taking over the reality of what [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=342.94s)]
*  it takes to end a nuclear program, which to be fair, we had that reality in the Obama [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  administration when five countries that included Russia and Iran agreed to have U.N. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=352.14s)]
*  inspectors go into these sites and figure out exactly what is and what is not going on [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=357.54s)]
*  in Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=362.9s)]
*  Well, the president also said that a nuclear deal with Iran is no longer necessary because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=364.5s)]
*  of the strikes over the weekend. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  What are your thoughts about that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=371.34s)]
*  Again, what's the evidence that backs that up? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=374.46s)]
*  He's not letting the director of the National Intelligence Department, that's Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=376.62s)]
*  She's going to be in a very contentious situation with the Senate tomorrow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=381.73999999999995s)]
*  The Congress isn't getting the full reports. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=386.34s)]
*  We're hearing our own president insulting the Defense Intelligence Agency, saying that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=388.66s)]
*  Israel has better intelligence. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=393.38s)]
*  So again, this should be a very easy case to make to the public. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=395.1s)]
*  Release a series of reports, show us the data, show reporters some of the images and talk [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  in very deep practical terms about what each phase of this nuclear program had looked like [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=405.1s)]
*  and how far we have damaged it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=410.9s)]
*  Without that, it is very hard to see and believe that this is all over. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=413.9s)]
*  Stuart, we are now hearing from cabinet secretaries like John Radcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, as [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=419.38s)]
*  Nayyar just pointed out, confirming that Iran's program was indeed destroyed or severely damaged. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=424.34s)]
*  I can't even believe I'm asking you this because I'm pretty sure I know your answer. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=431.02s)]
*  Do you trust what we're hearing? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=434.78s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=436.02s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if people watched this press conference today. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=437.02s)]
*  It was a little more extraordinary thing I'd ever seen in politics. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=439.46s)]
*  And you've said that a lot. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=444.02s)]
*  Yeah, just forget what Trump really liked, the way he loops around and he repeats himself [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=445.29999999999995s)]
*  and all this weird stuff he went on about the Secretary of War, maybe we should change [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  that Secretary of Defense. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=454.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's like if you're sitting next to this person on a plane, you would sort of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  like move away or something. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=459.26s)]
*  And that's how the United States is being presented. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=461.74s)]
*  Look, the test of qualifications to work for Donald Trump is loyalty. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=464.94s)]
*  And all of these guys give this vibe, like Hegseth and Rubio today, you know, they give [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=471.18s)]
*  off this vibe that if Donald Trump said, you know, I want one of your kids as tribute, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=475.94s)]
*  that maybe they would screw up enough courage to say, well, can I pick which one? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=480.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=483.26s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's incredible. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=484.26s)]
*  And it's across the whole administration. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=486.98s)]
*  One thing I can say, I think, with some certainty, within a short period of time Netanyahu is [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=491.02s)]
*  going to be saying that Iran poses a nuclear threat. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=497.9s)]
*  And it'll be true. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=501.58s)]
*  You can't destroy a program that's been at work for 25 years in one night of strikes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=502.58s)]
*  And look, I'm sort of a hawk on this stuff. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=507.82s)]
*  I think it'd be great if they could destroy this. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that Iran should have a nuclear weapon, but it completely destroys the credibility [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=513.5s)]
*  of the whole process to say, well, we've done it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=518.14s)]
*  So therefore it can't ever happen again. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=520.62s)]
*  It's just nothing about this is good for the United States. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=523.26s)]
*  I saw that you were surprised that I was able to clarify the daddy comment, but you should [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=527.62s)]
*  know that I have the word daddy Google alerted anytime it hits major media. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=532.74s)]
*  I was flagged. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=536.74s)]
*  What do you think about the fact that the FBI and the Pentagon are now investigating [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=540.74s)]
*  how the early Intel report became public and Axios is reporting that now the White House [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=545.9000000000001s)]
*  is planning to limit sharing classified information with Congress. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=550.98s)]
*  How big of a deal is that? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=555.7800000000001s)]
*  I think it's huge. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, to pick up on what Stewart was saying, I think that was one of the weirdest and most [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  sobering facets of this press conference today was his tone in rhetoric toward the journalists [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=561.18s)]
*  in the room, particularly from CNN and the Times and the aspersions that he cast at them, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=565.38s)]
*  what he said about what they'd done, how repeatedly he insinuated that they weren't loyal or they [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=571.02s)]
*  didn't appreciate the military, all kinds of cutting remarks like that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=575.9s)]
*  Look, it's clear from what Neera said a moment ago, he's so focused on this attack and I [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=580.78s)]
*  want to diminish the importance of it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=585.02s)]
*  And it was a big call that he made and obviously took a lot of effort for it to be executed. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  But I talked to Secretary Ernest Moniz, who is the energy secretary during the Obama years [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=591.66s)]
*  and negotiated with John Kerry this Iran deal. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=595.9399999999999s)]
*  And he said, look, it could take an incredibly long period of time before you could verify [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=598.46s)]
*  with any accuracy how much damage is done, what the status of this program is. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=602.54s)]
*  And we've talked about President Trump's attitude toward trade policy over and over again. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=607.18s)]
*  There's a focus on the immediate and not what follows. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=611.22s)]
*  So with trade policies, let's get these factories back, let's onshore, et cetera. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=613.82s)]
*  But there's no demonstrable plan for doing that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=617.62s)]
*  And I think we're seeing something that's very similar here with this, which is, look, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=619.9000000000001s)]
*  he called in these planes, he used these bunker busters. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  Now it's done. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=626.6600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of work yet to do. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=627.7800000000001s)]
*  And so something that Secretary Moniz said to me was that's what's most important at [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=629.2600000000001s)]
*  this moment. How do you go from there to getting Iran to, yes, talk to you again, but figure [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=633.0600000000001s)]
*  out what this program is going to be like in any shape? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtlT4UCYuIo&t=638.2600000000001s)]
