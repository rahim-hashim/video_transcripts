# Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire expected today
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw)
*  General, part of the deal includes the U.S. leading an international economic effort to try [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=0.0s)]
*  and prevent Iran and Hezbollah from doing the reconstruction. How important is it to try and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=4.48s)]
*  prevent Iran from stepping back in? And then, General, also just the responsibility the Lebanese [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=11.92s)]
*  army is going to have on this. It's not a very, as Hala was saying, not a very strong armed forces. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=18.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're quite right. Look, at the end of the day, this is a reality of the battlefield. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  Diplomacy ratifies the outcomes that are actually occurring in war. And the Hezbollah has been [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=32.32s)]
*  devastated, starting with the loss of much of their chain of command with the explosion of these [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=40.64s)]
*  devices throughout Lebanon. And now we've seen incredibly effective Israeli intelligence that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  has allowed their air force to devastate not just the units, the 100,000-man fighting force, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=56.08s)]
*  but also their missile stocks. So it's very good news. The Israelis have taken significant casualties. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  As you discussed already, there are a million Lebanese who are refugees and 80,000-some-od [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=70.96s)]
*  Israelis. So this will be well received. I've also been watching casualties on Israeli TV and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=78.32s)]
*  newspapers, and they've taken some really significant losses, both in Gaza and also [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=85.6s)]
*  in southern Lebanon. So it's good news. And we ought to take into account also the fact there's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=91.92s)]
*  a Trump bow wave in all of this. His support for Israel has been publicly unyielding. And so Hezbollah, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=97.12s)]
*  I think, decided we better get aboard here before the new administration takes office. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  General, you were talking about those pagers, beepers, walkie-talkie attacks. They're really [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  devastating. It was devastating to the entire Hezbollah infrastructure. I'm just wondering, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=118.64s)]
*  the Hezbollah of today is a different Hezbollah than it was just a year ago, and certainly over [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=125.04s)]
*  the years when we remember—I remember going from Beirut to Baalbek and the stops that one had to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=132.16s)]
*  make along the way, because Hezbollah had road checkpoints. It's a different Hezbollah today? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  General, you were talking about the Hezbollah of today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=148.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's been well equipped by the Iranians and others. It has very modern [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=149.2s)]
*  anti-tank weapons, a pretty decent ability to attack Israel with missiles and drones [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=155.04s)]
*  throughout this conflict, by the way. It's really discussed. Yesterday, I think there were well over [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=162.16s)]
*  100 Hezbollah missiles fired at Israel. So they were deemed to be an impressive fighting force, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=167.76s)]
*  bringing in even greater recognition, the effectiveness, as to what the IDF has [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  taken them apart. So they've been defeated tactically in the battlefield. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=182.0s)]
*  The good news is we keep talking about a weak Lebanese National Army. That's quite true. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  But they'll be very effective, I think, as peacekeepers if the withdrawal behind the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=193.28s)]
*  Latani River takes place. I think it will. I think this is a real triumph for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=199.28s)]
*  U.S. and French diplomacy. And one can only hope now that that will allow Hamas to feel even more [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=205.04s)]
*  isolated and perhaps bring a stop to that fight. The economic reconstruction, the money ought to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=212.88s)]
*  come out of the Saudis, the Egyptians, the Gulf Coast states. There shouldn't be a U.S. responsibility [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=219.6s)]
*  to rebuild these devastated areas. But I think our diplomacy has been a major factor in bringing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=227.36s)]
*  in fighting to a stop. I want to bring in Aaron David Miller, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  Endowment for International Peace and a former Arab-Israeli negotiator. Aaron, let's talk about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=238.96s)]
*  that. Diplomacy, the impact effect of diplomacy as someone who has served as an advisor in these [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  kinds of negotiations. What do you make of this apparent deal? You know, my experience in General [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  Rokafri, I think, has said a lot of wisdom there. My experience in Israeli negotiations is, first of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=255.92s)]
*  all, they only have two speeds, slow and slower. And number two, when they do work, they work [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=261.76s)]
*  because there is real urgency. That is to say, the incentives for reaching a deal, in this case on [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=266.8s)]
*  the part of Israel and Hezbollah, are much more compelling than the disincentives of allowing the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=271.52s)]
*  status quo to pertain. Israelis have done an enormous amount of damage to Hezbollah's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=279.76s)]
*  financial reserves, its gold deposits, its command and control. Yesterday, the day before, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  they went after the last senior commander, Mohammed Haider, in Beirut, who was in charge [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  of operations. So there is urgency there. On the Israeli side, I think there is also urgency. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=296.0s)]
*  Seventy thousand Israelis have been uprooted from the northern border towns in Kibbutzim. That is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=300.72s)]
*  number one. Israel, as you know, is a small standing army. It relies mainly on reserves, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  and they have been at war now. Reserved duty has been extended. And frankly, for an Israeli [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=311.28s)]
*  prime minister, for whom politics is everything and staying in power is everything, this is a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  lot easier deal to do than Gaza. With Gaza, it is Palestinians, it is hostages, it is Israeli [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=320.4s)]
*  withdrawal, it is the return of large numbers of Palestinian prisoners who have either been [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=329.11999999999995s)]
*  convicted or charged with killing Israelis. So a lot of urgency. And I suspect, even though nobody [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=334.08s)]
*  ever lost money betting against Arab-Israeli peace agreements, this one may take a little [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=341.12s)]
*  while longer today or tomorrow. This one, I think, will be set into motion, whether it will endure [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=346.72s)]
*  another matter. I mean, and David, this is also a reaffirmation, is it not, of Netanyahu's policy [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=354.16s)]
*  in the state? I'm sorry, Aaron, of not only Netanyahu's policy, but the state of Israel's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=361.92s)]
*  policy on how to react after the 7th of October and what they have done in Lebanon to Hezbollah [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=367.2s)]
*  is also probably one of the main motivating factors for Hezbollah to be willing to take this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=374.4s)]
*  ceasefire. No doubt. And I guess the core question would be for the diplomats is whether or not [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=381.28s)]
*  Israeli escalation dominance in Hamas, excuse me, in Gaza, in Lebanon, and even with Iran [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  will lead over the next several months to de-escalation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=395.12s)]
*  You know, the president-elect here may well prove to be a very lucky man when it comes to this region [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=400.0s)]
*  because he's inheriting these three conflicts at a time when the parties, frankly, have more reason [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  to de-escalate than to escalate. A lot of that, frankly, it's hard for many to admit is the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  consequence of Israeli military escalation and dominance, clearly, in Lebanon and also in Gaza, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=418.16s)]
*  although the brightening loss of life among Palestinians, the suffering of the hostages [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=424.72s)]
*  and their families makes this also an acute humanitarian issue as well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=430.88000000000005s)]
*  you [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6w46XaMdOw&t=448.16s)]
