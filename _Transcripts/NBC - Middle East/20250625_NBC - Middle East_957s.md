# Lawrence: Trump, who dodged Vietnam, now feels like a warrior for watching bombs drop on Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI)
*  Well, at a NATO summit today in the Netherlands, Donald Trump completely reversed himself on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=0.0s)]
*  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=5.3s)]
*  A complete Trump reversal. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=7.34s)]
*  And Donald Trump finally agrees with every president since World War II that NATO is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=9.38s)]
*  a good thing and a good deal for the United States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=16.92s)]
*  Every other president has known that every day of their lives before they became president [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=22.14s)]
*  and every day that they served as president and every president not named Trump acted accordingly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=28.54s)]
*  with NATO. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=34.36s)]
*  Donald Trump spent four years as president of the United States being completely wrong [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=36.1s)]
*  about NATO saying repeatedly that it was what he called a ripoff. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  That was his term for NATO. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=47.04s)]
*  Donald Trump threatened repeatedly not to even consider defending other NATO countries [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=49.46s)]
*  if they are attacked. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  That is the central principle of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as expressed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=56.58s)]
*  in Article 5. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=61.06s)]
*  That is Article 5 of the NATO agreement that every NATO nation supports. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  Today Donald Trump, the slowest student in the history of the presidency, said this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=69.06s)]
*  As far as Article 5, look, when I came here, I came here because it was something I'm supposed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=77.5s)]
*  to be doing, but I left here a little bit differently. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=86.42s)]
*  I said I watched the heads of these countries get up and the love and the passion that they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=90.06s)]
*  showed for their country was unbelievable. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=97.9s)]
*  I've never seen quite anything like it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=100.14s)]
*  They want to protect their country and they need the United States. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=103.62s)]
*  And without the United States, it's not going to be the same. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=107.42s)]
*  Without the United States, they couldn't really have NATO. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=110.38s)]
*  It wouldn't work. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=113.34s)]
*  It wouldn't work. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=114.86s)]
*  It wouldn't work in the future because now they're paying much more money, but it wouldn't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=115.9s)]
*  work. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=120.5s)]
*  It was great. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=121.5s)]
*  And I left here differently. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=122.5s)]
*  I left here saying that these people really love their countries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=123.5s)]
*  It's not a ripoff. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=127.14s)]
*  And we're here to help them protect their country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=128.94s)]
*  So that is a complete reversal by Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=133.86s)]
*  And saying that NATO countries are paying more money, of course, is a misstatement of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=138.04s)]
*  the situation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=144.62s)]
*  NATO countries are spending more on national defense so that they can use that additional [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  spending to help Ukraine defend against Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=153.46s)]
*  That is why NATO allies are spending more money on defense. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=160.54s)]
*  Donald Trump's complete reversal on NATO will not likely be one of the headlines of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=165.78s)]
*  Trump participation in the NATO summit because Donald Trump speaks in such hard to follow [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=171.1s)]
*  gibberish and because Donald Trump tried to turn his public speaking at the NATO summit [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=176.14s)]
*  into a triumph for a war president that he is now pretending to be. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=181.62s)]
*  As we reported last night, the United States assessment of the bomb damage that Donald [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=188.74s)]
*  Trump's bombing of Iran delivered is inconclusive, which makes sense when you're trying to bomb [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=193.78s)]
*  things that are underground and hard to tell how much damage has been done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=199.78s)]
*  The Trump administration assessment of the bombing obtained by NBC News, quote, concludes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=204.3s)]
*  that the U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear enrichment sites were not as effective as [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=211.66s)]
*  Trump claimed and that they set the Iran nuclear program back by only three to six months, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=217.08s)]
*  which completely contradicts Donald Trump's claim that Iran's facilities were obliterated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=227.06s)]
*  by the American bombing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=234.18s)]
*  Obliterated is Donald Trump's term and only Donald Trump's term. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=236.26s)]
*  No one else is saying that about the bombing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=240.5s)]
*  Donald Trump believes that the use of the word obliterated means that he personally [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=243.18s)]
*  did not just end the war between Israel and Iran, but that he personally won that war. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  So I have, as you know, Marco Rubio with me and Pete Hegs, Secretary of State and Secretary [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=255.74s)]
*  of War. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  Should we say Secretary of War? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  It used to be called Secretary of War. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  Maybe for a couple of weeks we'll call it that because we feel like warriors. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=269.1s)]
*  We feel like warriors. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=275.46s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump feels like a warrior. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump, who evaded military service during the Vietnam War because he claimed [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=281.38s)]
*  his foot hurt, the same foot on which he spent the rest of his life, playing endless miles [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=285.26s)]
*  of golf and never limping. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  There is no reason to believe that Donald Trump wasn't perfectly healthy enough to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=293.2s)]
*  serve in the military during the war of his youth. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  But like most men who were eligible to serve in the Vietnam War at that time, Donald Trump [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=300.1s)]
*  was terrified of being sent to the jungles of Vietnam and becoming another statistic [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=306.26000000000005s)]
*  in the American military body count that was far greater than all of the wars, the American [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=312.1s)]
*  wars of the 21st century combined. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=317.74s)]
*  And so Donald Trump, who only had to choose which ridiculous hat to wear when he went [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=321.06s)]
*  to the Situation Room to be a spectator during his war in Iran, now feels like a warrior. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=327.1s)]
*  The war that Donald Trump experienced in that air-conditioned room where he didn't even [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=336.82s)]
*  have to loosen his necktie makes Donald Trump feel like a warrior. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=340.98s)]
*  The biggest crybaby in the history of American politics now feels like a warrior. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=346.26s)]
*  The man who spent every single day of his political and presidential life complaining [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=353.1s)]
*  that he is being treated unfairly now feels like a warrior. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=358.86s)]
*  The man who told his insurrectionist mob that he would go to the Capitol with them on January [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  6th now feels like a warrior. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=371.06s)]
*  We all know that Donald Trump's gibberish in public speaking is very hard to follow. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=375.1s)]
*  It is also very hard for 79-year-old Donald Trump to follow his own gibberish while he's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=380.7s)]
*  saying it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=387.02s)]
*  And Donald Trump proved that again today when he contradicted himself in the middle of his [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  public comments. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=393.34s)]
*  Donald Trump was unable to adhere to his own line of argument, his own talking points, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=394.34s)]
*  that his bombing of Iran has completely solved the problem there, ended Iran's war with [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=400.58s)]
*  and eliminated any possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=407.18s)]
*  That was the line of argument Donald Trump tried to present and did present. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  And then Donald Trump stumbled into saying this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=419.06s)]
*  You just said you believe the conflict between Israel and Iran is over. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=426.3s)]
*  What makes you so confident it is? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=431.54s)]
*  And what do you do if it isn't? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=434.26000000000005s)]
*  Because I dealt with both and they're both tired, exhausted. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=435.7s)]
*  They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=439.9s)]
*  And they were both satisfied to go home and get out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  And can it start again? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=448.94s)]
*  I guess someday it can. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=450.21999999999997s)]
*  It could maybe start soon. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=451.62s)]
*  It could maybe start soon. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=455.53999999999996s)]
*  Remember after Hitler killed himself in the bunker in World War II and Europe ended? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=458.02s)]
*  Remember when President Harry Truman said, can it start again? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=462.58s)]
*  I guess someday it can. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=465.34s)]
*  It could maybe start soon. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=467.06s)]
*  No, Harry Truman didn't say that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=468.98s)]
*  And remember when World War II ended with Japan's surrender? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=471.98s)]
*  And Harry Truman said, can it start again? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=476.02s)]
*  I guess someday it can. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  It could maybe start soon. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=479.94s)]
*  No, President Harry Truman didn't say that because every president other than Donald [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump has known when a war has ended and when a war has just taken a pause. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=487.76s)]
*  Think of how breathtakingly ignorant you have to be about both Iran and Israel to say [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=494.4s)]
*  that they're both exhausted and they just won't fight anymore because they're both tired. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=500.84s)]
*  Israel has fought longer wars and has used more resources in those wars than it used [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=509.2s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=514.6s)]
*  Israel does not get tired of defending itself. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=515.84s)]
*  Donald Trump was probably speaking for himself as both tired and exhausted. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=522.88s)]
*  And that's why he's completely incapable of thinking about what happens next. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=529.6s)]
*  But on his best day, Donald Trump isn't capable of thinking about what happens next in any [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=534.5s)]
*  situation, tired or not. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=539.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is the first president of the United States to be convinced that Iran is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=541.96s)]
*  just going to give up any interest in nuclear energy or nuclear weapons. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=546.52s)]
*  I don't see them getting back involved in the nuclear business anymore. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=554.36s)]
*  I think they've had it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  They've been at it for 20 years and I don't see that happening either. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  And immediately after saying that, Donald Trump, 79-year-old tired and exhausted Donald [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=566.64s)]
*  Trump after all that jet lag from all that travel, contradicted himself with the possibility [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=572.92s)]
*  that Iran would, as he put it, get involved in the nuclear business again. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, if it does, we're always there. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  It won't be me. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=590.92s)]
*  It'll be somebody else. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=591.92s)]
*  But we're there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=592.92s)]
*  We'll have to do something about it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=593.92s)]
*  So much for the President for Life idea. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is admitting that four years from now he won't be president and maybe the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=599.0s)]
*  next president or the president after that or the president after that will have to deal [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=602.72s)]
*  with Iran again on nuclear weapons, which is exactly why President Obama and Secretary [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=607.12s)]
*  of State John Kerry successfully negotiated a deal with Iran in which Iran pledged in [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  writing to never develop nuclear weapons and to allow the United States to monitor what [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=617.28s)]
*  they were doing inside Iran and inside their military facilities and allow international [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=623.66s)]
*  observers in there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=629.54s)]
*  Because that sort of thing involves paperwork, which also involves reading, which Donald [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=632.02s)]
*  Trump is incapable of doing and even thinking about, never mind caring about. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=637.3399999999999s)]
*  The way I look at it, they fought, the war's done, and I could get a statement that they're [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=645.54s)]
*  not going to go nuclear. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=651.3199999999999s)]
*  Probably going to ask for that, but they're not going to be doing it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=652.66s)]
*  But they're not going to be doing it anyway. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=656.2199999999999s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=658.2199999999999s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=659.2199999999999s)]
*  So there's Donald Trump once again today becoming the first president who has ever dealt with [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=663.8199999999999s)]
*  Iran who believes now that Iran has had it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=670.74s)]
*  Iran has definitely just given up and given up its nuclear ambitions. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=676.62s)]
*  That makes Donald Trump the most trusting and gullible American president ever to deal [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=681.86s)]
*  with the Iranian dictatorship. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=690.32s)]
*  But I've asked Marco, do you want to draw, I just asked him the question as we're walking [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=694.22s)]
*  on the stage, do you want to draw up a little agreement for them to sign? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  Because I think we can get them to sign it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=701.66s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=704.7s)]
*  He doesn't think it's necessary. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=708.1800000000001s)]
*  And so Donald Trump, who now trusts Iran, doesn't think it's necessary to negotiate [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=709.76s)]
*  an agreement in writing with Iran. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=715.92s)]
*  And simpleton Donald Trump thinks a nuclear deal with Iran is something that you can just [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=718.88s)]
*  ask the secretary of state to draw up a little agreement for them to sign. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=725.12s)]
*  Thinks that's how it works. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=729.72s)]
*  And that's the kind of thought that can just occur to you when you're walking on stage [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=731.52s)]
*  to do a press conference. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=735.9399999999999s)]
*  That's how this stuff works in Donald Trump's tiny mind. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=737.18s)]
*  That's how much planning Donald Trump thinks is involved in something like the extraordinary [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=741.38s)]
*  and historic nuclear deal with Iran that John Kerry negotiated. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=746.52s)]
*  And Donald Trump in the single stupidest diplomatic act by an American president in foreign policy [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=752.0999999999999s)]
*  involving Iran in the 21st century simply ripped up. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=761.12s)]
*  And that's why Benjamin Netanyahu went to war with Iran. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=766.46s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump dropped bombs on Iran because Donald Trump ripped up the nuclear [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=770.58s)]
*  agreement in which Iran pledged not to develop nuclear weapons and pledged transparency for [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=775.46s)]
*  international monitors to check on what Iran was doing in all the kinds of military sites [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=781.7800000000001s)]
*  that Israel and the United States bombed. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump blabbed on about how much he trusts Iran now and how much he doesn't care [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=793.3s)]
*  if there's an agreement. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to talk to them next week with Iran. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=804.3599999999999s)]
*  We may sign an agreement. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  To me, I don't think it's that necessary. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, they had a war, they fought. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=812.3199999999999s)]
*  Now they're going back to their world. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=814.56s)]
*  I don't care if I have an agreement or not. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=816.12s)]
*  The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about we want no [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=818.84s)]
*  nuclear, but we destroyed the nuclear. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=823.22s)]
*  In other words, it's destroyed. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=825.86s)]
*  I said Iran will not have nuclear. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=827.6600000000001s)]
*  We blew it up. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=831.34s)]
*  It's blown up. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=832.34s)]
*  The kingdom come. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=834.22s)]
*  And so I don't feel very strongly about it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=835.62s)]
*  We got a document, wouldn't be bad. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=838.38s)]
*  We're going to meet with them, actually. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=840.38s)]
*  We're going to meet with them. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=841.38s)]
*  Did you hear what he actually said in the middle of that gibberish? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=844.74s)]
*  He said these words exactly. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=848.22s)]
*  They fought and now they're going back to their world. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't care if I have an agreement or not. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=855.6s)]
*  So Iran fought and now they're going back to their world. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=859.44s)]
*  In other words, Donald Trump is asking nothing of Iran after dropping bombs on Iran that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=866.0s)]
*  makes him feel like a warrior. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=872.24s)]
*  Donald Trump says that they're just going to go back to their world. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=874.44s)]
*  They're going back to their world, meaning Iran's dictatorial regime, they're going [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=878.22s)]
*  back to their world. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  In other words, they're going back to doing whatever they were doing before and whatever [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=884.96s)]
*  they want to do. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=889.12s)]
*  And Donald Trump doesn't care. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=890.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is totally fine with that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=892.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's not what you do when you win wars. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  When you win a war, you tell the other side what to do. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=900.66s)]
*  When we won World War II, we told Germany and Japan exactly what they would be allowed [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=904.78s)]
*  to do and what they would not be allowed to do for many, many years to come. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=909.64s)]
*  And Germany and Japan fully obeyed the orders of the victorious United States of America, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=914.38s)]
*  because that's how it works when you really win a war. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=921.7199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has not won a war and there is no war on the horizon that Donald Trump will [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=925.28s)]
*  win. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuHPDo8KAI&t=930.18s)]
