# ‘The clock is working against us’: Father of hostage speaks out
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g)
*  Joining me now is veteran diplomat, former deputy secretary of state, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=0.0s)]
*  ambassador Wendy Sherman, and Jonathan Dekelkhen, father of American hostages, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=3.6s)]
*  Sagih Dekelkhen. Welcome to both of you. Wendy Sherman, let's start with the breaking news. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=8.8s)]
*  Turkey says that this 26-year-old woman was shot by the Israeli Defense Force, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  or Israeli security forces. Two other Americans have been killed in the West Bank. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=19.68s)]
*  It's not the first. We don't know who did it. You know, it's been a lot of shooting on all sides. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=25.92s)]
*  The settlers are well armed as well. But we want to talk about this and the tensions between the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  U.S. and Israel about the reality of those hostage talks. It's been going on since May. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=40.08s)]
*  Truly. We are in a really, really tough place. And obviously, your other guest, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=45.2s)]
*  Jonathan Dekelkhen, is very concerned about his son, who remains a hostage. There are seven [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=50.800000000000004s)]
*  Americans who remain hostages. All I can say, Andrew, is I'm very glad that it's President Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=56.56s)]
*  and Vice President Harris who are trying to manage this incredibly complex situation, as all of these [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=62.24s)]
*  are in the world. And the West Bank has been in some ways underreported because there's settlement [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=67.84s)]
*  activity there that increases violence and increases the likelihood of having two fronts [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=74.08s)]
*  happening along with Lebanon, along with what Iran might be doing in the region. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=81.84s)]
*  This is a very tough situation. And the toughest, of course, as a mother, is having watched [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=86.8s)]
*  Hirsch Goldberg-Polin buried along with others this week. Just devastating. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=96.08s)]
*  And, Jonathan, let's talk about your family, your worries, your fears for your son, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=102.24s)]
*  and the devastation. Your son has yet to meet his newborn daughter, born while he was in captivity. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=110.4s)]
*  How did the families deal with what happened to Hirsch Goldberg-Polin? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=119.76s)]
*  It's a horror, no question. It's not just Hirsch. Six beautiful young people were murdered, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=126.55999999999999s)]
*  executed by Hamas. The Israeli army recovered their bodies. These were unnecessary deaths. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=133.68s)]
*  Obviously, Hamas is a savage terrorist organization, but there could have been an agreement two months [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=140.16s)]
*  ago that would have brought all of these people home. And I would add to that. The week before that, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=145.84s)]
*  six other Israeli hostages, having been either executed or died from friendly fire, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=151.36s)]
*  were recovered by the IDF. Four of them were friends of mine for 40 years from Kibbutz-Nir-Oz-Aral. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=158.0s)]
*  So, clearly, for all the hostage families and for anyone who cares about the future, the possibility [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=166.24s)]
*  of future, forget about peace, even calm in our region, the clock is working against us. Because [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=172.8s)]
*  if the sides, particularly Israel in this case, continues to do nothing and just stonewalls the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=179.52s)]
*  process, then the absolute sure result is of the 101 remaining hostages, that they're all coming [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  home in boxes, if at all. And so it is incumbent on any right-thinking person, from the families, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=194.08s)]
*  to governments, and to supporters of Hamas, quite honestly, to put on right now maximum pressure [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=202.08s)]
*  before, obviously, all of the hostages are killed by Hamas. And also to avoid what is clearly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=209.04s)]
*  becoming a scenario of a major regional war. And the only way to defuse that, seems to me, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  and most diplomats would agree with me, and statespeople, real statespeople, not just demagogues, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  is to, the only way to defuse it is by getting to this, getting this agreement done in its current [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=230.0s)]
*  form. So I call on all friends of Israel, whatever your party, or inclinations, Zionists [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=236.72s)]
*  or otherwise, and all friends of Hamas, whoever you are, this is the moment that you have to do [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=245.84s)]
*  your part to push both of these parties to yes. And Jonathan, Wendy Sherman, who's nodding, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=253.76s)]
*  her assent here, former Secretary of State, what do you say when the Defense Minister, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=260.32s)]
*  the Israeli intelligence services, are all saying publicly and during the war cabinet meetings [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=267.12s)]
*  to the Prime Minister that it's time to put the hostages first and deal with Hamas later? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=273.84s)]
*  And they don't. What do you as a father say? Well, as a father and also as a patriotic Israeli, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=279.12s)]
*  I'm outraged. I'm crushed, of course. I came to Israel in 1981, and this government and its [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=286.64s)]
*  behavior really since January of 2023, it brought me to question that choice in 2023. I mean, it is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=295.28s)]
*  an unprecedented situation in Israel right now, where the elected government, it is an elected [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=303.76s)]
*  government, coalition government, for the first time in Israeli history, is consciously and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=308.64s)]
*  consistently working against the national interest of the country purely, purely to preserve its own [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=315.36s)]
*  power and in pursuit of an insane messianic vision of the most radical elements in all of Israeli [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=322.48s)]
*  society that constitute a tiny proportion. Yet they have, because of the coalition government [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=331.92s)]
*  and Prime Minister Netanyahu's legal problems, have enormous influence over it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=337.36s)]
*  And Secretary Sherman, what can the U.S. do with an ally when his own country is so divided on this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=342.88s)]
*  policy? Clearly, Hamas is the culprit. They could release them immediately. But what do you do with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=353.52s)]
*  an ally? Right. Hamas is the culprit. And that said, we are working very hard with Qatar, with Egypt, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=358.08s)]
*  to put pressure on Hamas. And at the same time, I would say to Prime Minister Netanyahu, the Knesset [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=364.08s)]
*  is out until after the high holidays, until late October. That means that he has political space [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=369.68s)]
*  to make very tough decisions. And who cannot respond? Listening to Jonathan speak about what [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=376.0s)]
*  is necessary, it is time for the Prime Minister to take very tough decisions. I really understand [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=383.12s)]
*  how difficult this is. But the Philadelphia-I-Carter, which has been one of the issues, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=388.8s)]
*  indeed Israel can take control of that any time it wants. There are many ways technologically to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=393.76s)]
*  make sure that Hamas cannot use it as a way to undermine Israel's security. There are other [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=399.04s)]
*  options here. We should get to a ceasefire and get to it now. It's important. It's critical [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  for the long-term security of Israel. And of course, it is critical for the livelihoods and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=409.6s)]
*  the life of Palestinians. Thank you so much, Jonathan. Thank you very much. Of course, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  our hearts are with you in this terrible struggle. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=422.32000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpCHC5poR4g&t=429.04s)]
