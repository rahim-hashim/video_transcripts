# Pentagon Announces U.S. Troops Have Left Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg)
*  I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan and the end of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=0.0s)]
*  the military mission to evacuate American citizens, third country nationals, and vulnerable [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=4.64s)]
*  Afghans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=10.24s)]
*  The last C-17 lifted off from Hamad Karzai International Airport on August 30th this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=11.24s)]
*  afternoon at 3.29 p.m. East Coast time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  And the last manned aircraft is now clearing the airspace above Afghanistan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=20.54s)]
*  We will soon release a photo of the last C-17 departing Afghanistan with Major General [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=25.32s)]
*  Chris Donahue and the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ross Wilson, aboard. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  While the military evacuation is complete, the diplomatic mission to ensure additional [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=34.92s)]
*  U.S. citizens and eligible Afghans who want to leave continues. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=40.36s)]
*  And I know that you have heard and I know that you're going to hear more about that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=44.32s)]
*  from the State Department shortly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=47.16s)]
*  Tonight's withdrawal signifies both the end of the military component of the evacuation, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=49.8s)]
*  but also the end of the nearly 20-year mission that began in Afghanistan shortly after September [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=54.96s)]
*  11, 2001. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=60.44s)]
*  It's a mission that brought Osama bin Laden to a just end, along with many of his al-Qaeda [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=62.84s)]
*  co-conspirators. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=67.08s)]
*  And it was not a cheap mission. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=68.08s)]
*  The cost was 2,461 U.S. service members and civilians killed and more than 20,000 who [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  were injured. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=76.64s)]
*  Sadly, that includes 13 U.S. service members who were killed last week by an ISIS-K suicide [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=77.64s)]
*  bomber. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=82.8s)]
*  We honor their sacrifice today as we remember their heroic accomplishments. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  No words from me could possibly capture the full measure of sacrifices and accomplishments [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  of those who served, nor the emotions they're feeling at this moment. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=95.5s)]
*  But I will say that I'm proud that both my son and I have been a part of it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGI0oc9hcg&t=99.83999999999999s)]
