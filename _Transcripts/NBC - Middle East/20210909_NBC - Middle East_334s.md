# Veterans React To News That 200 Americans, Allies Flying Out Of Kabul
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q)
*  First, your reaction to this flight making its way out of Kabul, 200 Americans on it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like everything having to do with the withdrawal and the evacuation, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=6.8s)]
*  Stephanie. It's a little bit of good news, but this is not a good news story. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=10.72s)]
*  The bigger story is that there are as many as 100 Americans still left behind. There could be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=14.8s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Afghan allies left behind, and flights haven't left in 10 days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=19.28s)]
*  So the debacle in Afghanistan, I think, continues to unfold, and many back here in America feel like [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=25.2s)]
*  the Afghanistan war is over. It's not over for the Afghan people. It's not over for our allies. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  It's not over for the veterans back home like Zach and so many others that are working to get [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=36.24s)]
*  people out and resettle people here at home. So it's the week of 9-11. We're going to say never [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=39.92s)]
*  forget. I think we have to remember never to forget what's happening in Afghanistan right now [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=44.72s)]
*  because it's about our core American values. And in many ways, it's been the great American betrayal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  of Afghanistan and of our American values and of the compacted veterans like me and Zach and so [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=54.24s)]
*  many others made with those people on the ground. Zach, you and I spoke about 10 days ago, and you [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=58.96s)]
*  were working on getting a private chartered flight out of Afghanistan. What happened? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=63.6s)]
*  They're still there. We're still trying to get them out. In fact, it's two flights. There's a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=69.28s)]
*  lot of folks that have stepped up to the plate, a lot of different organizations, a lot of different [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  ad hoc groups that are trying to get people out of Afghanistan. And there's no planning. There's no [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=78.16s)]
*  structure in place. And so we're still working on it. And these groups include U.S. citizens that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=83.84s)]
*  we're not able to get out. I think Anthony Blinken in the run-up to this segment said it best. He [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=90.0s)]
*  said we're trying to do everything in our power. I hope, I don't think we are trying to do everything [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=95.28s)]
*  in our power. If we are, I think that's a serious indictment of our status as a superpower, that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  we're not able to get people out of Afghanistan, in particular U.S. citizens and those that did so [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=104.56s)]
*  much serving by our side over the last two decades. So the people you are trying to get out who have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=109.76s)]
*  been waiting the last few days, are they safe? What's going on with those who are left behind? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to talk about where they are, who they are, or if they're safe or not. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=121.44s)]
*  The fact is people are not safe. It's why we are trying to get them out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=128.4s)]
*  And there has been no planning in place by the U.S. government for this effort. And many [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=133.28s)]
*  cases the U.S. government has been the greatest barrier. There was a story that came out a couple [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  weeks ago that had a quote in it that, you know, we as a country are capable of individual heroics. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=144.48s)]
*  And I think that is something we have seen over the last couple of weeks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=149.12s)]
*  Heroism on the ground from our troops, from our civil servants, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  heroism from groups of veterans and civil servants that have stepped up to the plate trying to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=155.76s)]
*  network and get people out who they don't want to leave behind. But we as a country are no longer [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=159.68s)]
*  capable of doing big heroic things. And I think that's what we're seeing play out in Afghanistan [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=165.28s)]
*  is we're leaving so many people behind. Gentlemen, let's shift gears and talk 9-11. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=170.0s)]
*  Paul, I know you were out there right after it happened trying to help recover people, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=175.52s)]
*  bodies from ground zero. Twenty years later, you said it, we always say we'll never forget. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=180.56s)]
*  But what does that mean to you and other first responders? What do you remember and what do you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=185.6s)]
*  want us to? 20 years went by pretty fast. But I think every time around this time of year, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=190.24s)]
*  it's really hard for the people that were there because we were so adversely impacted, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=198.24s)]
*  personally connected. We never forget every day. We think about the people we lost. We think about [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=202.32s)]
*  the people impacted. And then we think about the people who are struggling right now with the long [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=207.28s)]
*  term health impacts. That's one part of never forget is recognizing that 9-11 first responders [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=210.64s)]
*  and survivors, kids who went to Stuyvesant High School, people who lived in the area [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  are still struggling with adverse health effects. Just yesterday, we lost another first responder [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=220.16s)]
*  to 9-11 health impacts. So never forget really means understanding it's not over, whether it's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=224.4s)]
*  in ground zero, whether it's in Afghanistan, whether it's our forever war. This is all [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=230.24s)]
*  interconnected. And never forgetting also means staying connected to what's happening [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=234.8s)]
*  and understanding that foreign policy and domestic policy have never been more closely impacted. But [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  this weekend, if you want to do something to help, there are ways to help. You can support [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=243.6s)]
*  9-11 first responders. There's a tremendous FTNY NYPD hockey game going on tonight at Madison [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=246.88s)]
*  Square Garden. But you can also honor our values by helping Zach and all the other veterans who [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=252.88s)]
*  are resettling our allies. That's a true part of remembering what America is all about, remembering [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=257.04s)]
*  the power of our unity and truly never forgetting. Zach, what are your thoughts on this? You know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=261.44s)]
*  I agree with Paul. You know, it means never leaving anyone behind. It means never forgetting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=267.44s)]
*  That's literally what it means. I think it also means when you look to the future or look to the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=272.08s)]
*  present, how you choose to live your life, the difference in the impact that you want to have. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=275.84s)]
*  One of the most important lessons I had as a young kid, I lost a very close friend and older [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  brother figure in a traffic in a car accident. And at his funeral, the rabbi said to us, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=284.32s)]
*  we have now an obligation to live our life for John. So for those that we lost on 9-11, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=289.76s)]
*  for those that we have lost in the wars that followed, we have an obligation to live our lives [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  as individuals, as veterans, as Americans, to honor their sacrifice, to make it mean something [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=300.4s)]
*  and be worthy of their sacrifice. And that's something I think that we should all think about, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=307.12s)]
*  not just on 9-11, but every day. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrofAj0b_Q&t=311.44s)]
