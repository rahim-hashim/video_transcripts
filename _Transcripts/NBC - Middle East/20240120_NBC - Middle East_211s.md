*  Sea joining me now from Tel Aviv Israel is NBC's Ralph Sanchez and Rob what [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  else can you tell us about this attack on Iranian officers and and the latest [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=21.92s)]
*  on the war in Gaza [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=25.12s)]
*  so Christine this strike took place in Syria and the capital Damascus but the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=26.12s)]
*  target appears to have been members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Iranian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=32.52s)]
*  state media is now saying five members of the Revolutionary Guard were killed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=37.68s)]
*  in this attack one of them appears to have been a senior intelligence official [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=42.64s)]
*  from the Quds Force which is this elite Iranian expeditionary unit you'll [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  remember Qasem Soleimani it was the head of the Quds Force before he was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=52.0s)]
*  assassinated in Iraq by the Trump administration this is a key part of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=56.68s)]
*  Iranian regime now Iran is blaming Israel for this attack Israel we know [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=62.08s)]
*  has carried out a years-long bombing campaign inside of Syria they tend [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=67.32s)]
*  though not to comment on these specific targeted strikes and that is the case [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=72.0s)]
*  today the Israeli military neither confirming nor denying that they were [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=76.84s)]
*  responsible but Christine this is part of this just dizzying flurry of attacks [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=81.84s)]
*  and counterattacks that we are seeing all over the Middle East it is very [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=87.16s)]
*  difficult to keep track frankly at this point there was a strike in southern [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=90.72s)]
*  Lebanon earlier as you mentioned the US military once again hitting Houthi [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=94.4s)]
*  militants in Yemen but the common nexus here is the war in Gaza which has been [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=99.12s)]
*  the inciting incident for this escalation all over the Middle East and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=104.84s)]
*  Christine there is very public disagreement right now between the Biden [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=109.36s)]
*  administration and the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=113.0s)]
*  Netanyahu about the future of Gaza President Biden making clear there needs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=116.56s)]
*  to be a two-state solution Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that is a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=122.48s)]
*  non-starter and the president was asked at the White House how to resolve those [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=127.28s)]
*  differences I want you to take a listen [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=132.0s)]
*  now you heard the president there taking a kind of glass half full approach to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=151.6s)]
*  this saying that under the right circumstances maybe the Israeli [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=157.16s)]
*  government under Prime Minister Netanyahu might agree to allowing a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=160.8s)]
*  Palestinian state to be established I can tell you Christine the Israeli [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=164.24s)]
*  Prime Minister has carved out a pretty successful 30-year career in Israeli [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  politics by saying no to a Palestinian state and by having public confrontations [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  with Democratic presidents all the way back to Bill Clinton about the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  possibility so we'll see what happens here but this is a public agreement that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=182.0s)]
*  doesn't appear to have an easy answer absolutely all right Raf Sanchez for us [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  in Israel thank you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkMRcg_tPs&t=189.4s)]
