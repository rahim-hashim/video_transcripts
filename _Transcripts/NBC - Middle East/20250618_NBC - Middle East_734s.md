# What’s the risk to the U.S. if ‘all-out ’ Israel-Iran war breaks out? Col. Jacobs weighs in
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU)
*  NBC's Garrett Haake is covering the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC's Courtney Qubee is on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=2.9s)]
*  Mark Mazzetti is an investigative reporter [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=5.7s)]
*  for the New York Times focused on national security. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=7.7s)]
*  And with me here in studio, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  retired Army Colonel Jack Jacobs, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=11.82s)]
*  recipient of the Medal of Honor [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  and an MSNBC military analyst. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=15.18s)]
*  So Garrett, no decision from the president. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=17.84s)]
*  What do we know about what's happening behind closed doors? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=20.26s)]
*  Who might have his ear? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=24.12s)]
*  Bring us up to speed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=25.8s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, well, no decision announced. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=27.26s)]
*  I think it's entirely possible [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=29.36s)]
*  that the president has made some choices. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  He's just not willing to talk about them yet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=32.56s)]
*  He's being advised by his national security team, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=34.86s)]
*  I'm told, more or less around the clock [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=37.04s)]
*  in a series of meetings and in the way [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=39.36s)]
*  that he likes to often kind of socialize any big decision, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=41.28s)]
*  sort of in a constant running conversation with his staff. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=44.5s)]
*  Everything that this White House is doing, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=49.18s)]
*  everything the president is saying [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=51.28s)]
*  seems to be pointing in one direction. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=53.08s)]
*  The president in that same running gaggle [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  on the White House lawn a short time ago [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=57.56s)]
*  saying that the advice he gave to Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=59.12s)]
*  for example, was to keep going, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=61.419999999999995s)]
*  saying that his message to the Iranians [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=63.12s)]
*  who say they want to fight back is good luck. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=65.36s)]
*  And saying this when asked, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=67.86s)]
*  what his post yesterday meant when he called [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  for the complete surrender of Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=71.1s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=73.34s)]
*  What does unconditional surrender mean? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=76.06s)]
*  Well, you know what it means. Unconditional surrender. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=78.5s)]
*  Can you explain it for those who don't? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=79.9s)]
*  Two very simple words. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  A very simple, unconditional surrender. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  That means I've had it. Okay? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  I've had it. I give up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  No more. They were bullies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  They were schoolyard bullies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=91.52s)]
*  And now they're not bullies anymore, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=94.52s)]
*  but we'll see what happens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  Look, nothing's finished until it's finished. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=97.02s)]
*  I wouldn't say that we want anything yet. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=98.88s)]
*  I would say that we sure as hell made a lot of progress. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=101.78s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=105.3s)]
*  The next week is going to be very big, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=106.66s)]
*  maybe less than a week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=108.16s)]
*  So a little bit of a tease there, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=110.74s)]
*  a little bit of bellicose rhetoric, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=111.74s)]
*  and all of it backed up by the White House, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=113.06s)]
*  which has been sending around quotes of all the times [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=114.66s)]
*  that the president has said either in the White House [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=116.8s)]
*  or on the campaign trail, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=118.64s)]
*  that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=119.9s)]
*  We heard similar language from JD Vance [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=122.38s)]
*  on Capitol Hill yesterday. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=124.08s)]
*  So again, no decision yet, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=125.34s)]
*  but the signs here at the White House [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=127.98s)]
*  seem to be pointing in one direction, Chris. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=129.14s)]
*  So, Mark, your new article laid out a fascinating timeline [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=131.32s)]
*  that recently, as April, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=134.12s)]
*  the president was pretty staunchly against this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=135.22s)]
*  So how do you go from that to seriously considering [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=138.26s)]
*  not only supporting Israel's effort, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=141.46s)]
*  but potentially joining it? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=143.58s)]
*  Well, some of it has to do with the increased leverage [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=147.28s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu had. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=150.62s)]
*  Since last fall, the things that used to keep Netanyahu [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  from striking Iran, like a Hezbollah retaliation, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=156.36s)]
*  like Iranian missiles, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=159.8s)]
*  like the fact that they had to fly through Syrian airspace, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=161.2s)]
*  all these things sort of fell away last fall, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=164.3s)]
*  and the risks to Israel and to Netanyahu lowered. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=167.5s)]
*  So he began this renewed push this spring to strike, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=172.12s)]
*  and by late May, it was clear to US intelligence [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=178.16s)]
*  that Israel was gonna strike [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  with or without the United States. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=182.06s)]
*  So Netanyahu, who once needed the United States, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=183.94s)]
*  needed them less so, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=187.44s)]
*  and so then Trump was put in this position of, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  well, would he join once Israel attacked? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=192.54s)]
*  Now, of course, we know that Israel can only do so much, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=194.88s)]
*  and what awaits now is this decision [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=198.28s)]
*  about whether the United States will join [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=200.68s)]
*  with these bunker buster bombs that Israel does not have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=203.12s)]
*  to get deeply fortified locations. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  So in a way, it became Netanyahu doing something [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=209.96s)]
*  where it became a fait accompli, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=212.86s)]
*  and then it's now in Trump's court. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=214.44s)]
*  Yeah, and Colonel, as he said, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=217.28s)]
*  we may learn something in the next week. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Who knows when, maybe sooner, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=220.3s)]
*  if the US commits to helping Israel [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  take out Iran's nuclear facilities, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  even just the one at Fordow, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=226.78s)]
*  which is the one that's deeply embedded in a mountain. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=228.12s)]
*  What are the chances we could limit it at that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, it might be even more limited [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=234.84s)]
*  than what you're suggesting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=236.28s)]
*  It's not guaranteed that even one or more than one [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=238.12s)]
*  bunker buster bombs will be able to destroy that site. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=243.08s)]
*  Well, is it the general belief [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  that it would probably take multiples of? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  It definitely would take multiples of those bombs, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=251.28s)]
*  and even then, you may only restrict access to it, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=254.48s)]
*  and eventually it might be able to be recovered [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=258.28s)]
*  by the Iranians, so it might slow them down, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=260.12s)]
*  but it won't necessarily take them out [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=264.24s)]
*  of the business of developing nuclear weapons. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=267.96s)]
*  Most of their, a lot of their fissile material [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=270.12s)]
*  has already been moved to other locations, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=273.32s)]
*  which we may or may not know about. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's not gonna be a knockout punch that people expect. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=277.86s)]
*  You could, however you're gonna expect, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  counterattacks by Iran on our forces in the Middle East. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=286.06s)]
*  Like we said, there are 40 to 50,000 Americans [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=290.62s)]
*  in the region, some of them in fixed bases. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=293.54s)]
*  We have ships in the region, plus commercial shipping. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=297.06s)]
*  You can expect that the Straits of Hormuz [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=301.54s)]
*  will be mined by the Iranians or their proxies. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=303.86s)]
*  There'll be attacks from Yemen, by the Houthis, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=306.68s)]
*  on commercial and military shipping. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=310.52s)]
*  So it's gonna be difficult to limit it, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  and we also have to keep in mind the fact [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=316.9s)]
*  that the Israelis, while they're not actually running low [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=318.94s)]
*  on their Iron Dome ammunition, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=323.28s)]
*  they certainly have lots less of it now [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  than they did at the beginning of the war. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  So there are lots of imponderables here, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=329.62s)]
*  the likelihood of this being over in a short time, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  very, very low, Chris. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=335.68s)]
*  So what did we hear, Courtney, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=337.68s)]
*  from the Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=339.92s)]
*  Did he have any more insight into the options [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=342.18s)]
*  that the US, that the President is weighing right now? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=348.74s)]
*  I mean, keep in mind, this was the first time [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=349.58s)]
*  that he's appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  since his confirmation hearing back in January. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=352.8s)]
*  So the questions were really all over the map. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=354.74s)]
*  I mean, dealing with everything that has happened [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=356.54s)]
*  in a very busy past several months [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=359.34000000000003s)]
*  since Pete Hegseth has been Secretary of Defense. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=361.66s)]
*  But he was asked about Iran, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=363.52s)]
*  he was asked about conversations that he had [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=365.16s)]
*  with the President about possible options. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=367.84s)]
*  He declined to give any details, though. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=369.46s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=371.5s)]
*  Most of what I can or should say [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=374.18s)]
*  would be reserved for a classified setting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=376.86s)]
*  I would say the President, obviously, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=379.5s)]
*  any decisions on this matter are at the presidential level. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=382.02s)]
*  My job, our job, Chairman and I, at all times, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=385.62s)]
*  is to make sure the President has options [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=388.98s)]
*  and is informed of what those options might be [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=391.14s)]
*  and what the ramifications of those options might be. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=394.06s)]
*  I appreciate that, thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=395.94s)]
*  You mentioned the troops in the region [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=397.29999999999995s)]
*  with maximum force protection at all times [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=398.5s)]
*  is being maintained. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=400.78s)]
*  And that's really the biggest issue [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=403.61999999999995s)]
*  when it comes to what could happen here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=405.38s)]
*  If the United States were to be involved [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  in a military strike or strikes against Iran, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=409.2s)]
*  the biggest concern that officials we've spoken to have [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=412.9s)]
*  is what the military calls [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  their second and third order effects. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=417.73999999999995s)]
*  So would US bases, US personnel in the region, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=419.76s)]
*  as you mentioned, there's thousands of them [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  forward deployed in the region, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  there's ships off the coast, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=426.74s)]
*  there's more moving in towards the region, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=427.78s)]
*  literally as we speak, would they be a potential target? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=429.62s)]
*  That's the biggest concern. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=432.82s)]
*  Officials telling us that they're at the highest state [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=433.74s)]
*  of readiness for the potential for some sort of attack. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=437.06s)]
*  But Chris, the reality is they've been [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=439.7s)]
*  at a heightened state of readiness ever since October 7th. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=441.82s)]
*  It's only been heightened since Israel began [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=444.5s)]
*  this air campaign, this strike campaign in Iran [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=447.46s)]
*  late last week, but defense officials are very concerned [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=450.46s)]
*  about the possibility that, again, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=453.34s)]
*  if the United States were to be involved [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=454.66s)]
*  in a kinetic part of this conflict, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  so not just support, that there would be ramifications [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=459.18s)]
*  for US personnel in the region. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=461.82000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much, Courtney and QB, on the Hill for us. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=464.42s)]
*  So, Mark, we know there is this split [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=466.66s)]
*  between some hardliners who are pushing [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=468.02000000000004s)]
*  for a stronger response to Iran, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=469.8s)]
*  others who want to stay out of the war. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=471.64000000000004s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, who's very much in that latter group, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=474.98s)]
*  did an interview with Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=478.06s)]
*  who has advocated for regime change. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  And it started with Tucker Carlson asking Cruz [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=482.18s)]
*  if he knew how many people lived in Iran, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  and then it grew more heated from there. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=487.82s)]
*  I don't sit around memorizing population tables. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=492.06s)]
*  Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=494.58s)]
*  for the overthrow of the government. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=496.7s)]
*  Why is it relevant, whether it's 90 million [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=498.38s)]
*  or 80 million or 100 million? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=500.7s)]
*  Why is that relevant? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=501.97999999999996s)]
*  Because if you don't know anything about the country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=502.82s)]
*  I didn't say I don't know anything about the country. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=504.02s)]
*  Okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=505.26s)]
*  They are Persians and predominantly Shia. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=508.26s)]
*  Okay, this is... [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=510.9s)]
*  No, it's not even, you don't know anything about Iran. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=511.73999999999995s)]
*  So actually the country... [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=514.34s)]
*  Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=515.18s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=518.42s)]
*  of the government and you don't know anything [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=520.62s)]
*  about the country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  No, you don't know anything about the country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=523.3s)]
*  So, so many questions, Mark, out of that, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=526.86s)]
*  but maybe the most pointed one is, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=531.3s)]
*  do we have any sense of who Trump is listening to now? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=532.98s)]
*  Is political pressure weighing on him at all? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=535.5799999999999s)]
*  Is this purely a national security debate right now? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=538.66s)]
*  What do we know about the considerations, if anything? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's a great question. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  And especially in the second term with the president Trump, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=548.3399999999999s)]
*  it's really much more of a mystery [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=552.78s)]
*  of what ultimately is guiding these kinds of decisions. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=555.02s)]
*  I think the first term, given his circle of advisors, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=558.38s)]
*  it was a lot more stable in sort of knowing who was advising [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=561.66s)]
*  and where he was getting the inputs from. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=564.62s)]
*  This time around, it's a lot more difficult. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=567.06s)]
*  I mean, obviously we know the past positions [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=569.26s)]
*  of people like JD Vance. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=571.86s)]
*  We obviously know where Tucker Carlson stands. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=574.5s)]
*  He's not an official advisor, but obviously someone [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=576.46s)]
*  who President Trump has listened to in the past. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=578.58s)]
*  It shows that the interview, the clip you showed, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=581.62s)]
*  it just clearly shows a lot of the schisms [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=583.82s)]
*  within the president's own party. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=586.38s)]
*  And so my guess is that these kinds of debates [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=588.74s)]
*  and different like fights for the president's mind [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=593.5400000000001s)]
*  are gonna last right up until he makes the decision, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=596.74s)]
*  if he hasn't already. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=599.58s)]
*  So Jack, when Iran threatens all out war, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=601.78s)]
*  what does that even look like? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=604.58s)]
*  What's the risk to the US? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  Is it confined mostly to those 40 or 50,000 troops, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=608.58s)]
*  as you say, who are in the direct path? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=612.7s)]
*  Yeah, probably not, is the answer to the latter question. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=614.9s)]
*  You know, saying all out war is a bit like the vague assertion [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=617.74s)]
*  that what we want is unconditional surrender. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=624.1s)]
*  Surrender to who? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  What's the war really look like? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=628.14s)]
*  And the likelihood is that if there are attacks [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=630.14s)]
*  on American personnel and American assets in the region, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=632.74s)]
*  that we will retaliate directly onto specific targets [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=636.82s)]
*  that will have already been selected, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=640.1s)]
*  and they have been selected by the National Command [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=642.7800000000001s)]
*  Authority, who will then issue instructions [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=645.58s)]
*  for those specific targets inside Iran to be struck. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=647.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a given, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=650.26s)]
*  You cannot sit if there's been an indirect attack [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=651.3000000000001s)]
*  on American troops. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=654.7800000000001s)]
*  Although we have done that in the past, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=656.5s)]
*  we've turned the other cheek in the past. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=657.78s)]
*  In this administration? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=660.5s)]
*  No, no, not in this administration. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=661.5s)]
*  And the likelihood of that's happening again, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=663.22s)]
*  that's also very, very low. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=665.54s)]
*  Iran is in a very difficult position [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=668.7s)]
*  from a wide variety of standpoints, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  not the least significant of which, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=672.94s)]
*  is that they've got a large, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=674.1800000000001s)]
*  and some would say a restive population, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwlhpA7HCvU&t=675.86s)]
