# Fmr. Amb Crocker: ‘growing optimism’ in Israel for a ceasefire amidst tension on Lebanon border
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI)
*  Joining me now is Ambassador Ryan Crocker, former ambassador to Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Lebanon, and Pakistan. Among other important posts, Ambassador, you are a survivor of the 1983 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  embassy bombing. I'm not telling you that. I'm telling our viewers who may not know that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=13.6s)]
*  Israel, until only days ago, was insisting it had to continue striking Hezbollah pockets [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=18.0s)]
*  and weapons stockpiles in southern Lebanon. Do you think they've now accomplished [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  those goals and as well are willing to agree to stop hitting Beirut, which has been the real [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=29.12s)]
*  concern of the administration? I think it is definitely time for Israel to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=35.84s)]
*  work with the United States and others on a ceasefire in Lebanon as well as in Gaza, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  that they have successfully decapitated Hezbollah, something that I certainly applaud since [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=49.84s)]
*  among those they've targeted were individuals responsible for the bombing of the embassy and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=57.6s)]
*  later the Marine barracks in 1983. But we have to remember that Hezbollah was born in the Israeli [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=63.6s)]
*  invasion and subsequent occupation of Lebanon in 1982 and 1983. It is highly unlikely that it is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=72.4s)]
*  going to be exterminated by another invasion and another occupation. And I think the Israelis need [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=80.0s)]
*  to again take the win and withdraw their forces in the context of a ceasefire that Hezbollah would [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=85.92s)]
*  sign on to. That's the only way I can see the inhabitants of northern Israel returning to their [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=94.0s)]
*  homes. And again, it's important to remember that the invasion of 1982 was called Operation Peace for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=100.08s)]
*  Galilee. Well, you know, 42 years later, we're a long way from peace for Galilee. And Hezbollah [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=106.56s)]
*  has shown an ability to continue its rocket fire into northern Israel. So the Biden administration [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=115.68s)]
*  effort to achieve a ceasefire is something that I very much hope will be successful, that the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Israelis will listen carefully and that Iran will too. I was traveling with Secretary Blinken [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=129.36s)]
*  last week and was questioning him and Minister Safadi from Jordan. And you know, it was the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=136.16s)]
*  foreign minister and deputy prime minister. And the Jordanian minister said to Secretary Blinken [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=142.48s)]
*  that Israel is not listening to anyone. His conclusion after the week of diplomacy from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=150.4s)]
*  the secretary was that Israel's prime minister is just not listening to the U.S., that the U.S. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=155.6s)]
*  doesn't have enough leverage. Is the U.S. not using the leverage it has? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=160.4s)]
*  Well, this has been a hugely complicated and very tragic situation for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=166.32s)]
*  all those involved. The Palestinians have suffered horribly in Gaza. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  The trauma of October 7th on Israel and Israelis cannot possibly be overestimated. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=177.36s)]
*  And now we're seeing suffering in Lebanon. I think it's very important that the prime minister of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=183.36s)]
*  Israel take a deep breath and consider where he is, what has been achieved, and what the options [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=189.68s)]
*  are going forward. Again, we had the situation during Operation Peace for Galilee in 1982, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=196.24s)]
*  where then Defense Minister Eric Sharon had his own plan and his own intention of doing things [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  and was singularly unresponsive to the U.S. That did not end well, not for the U.S. and not for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Israel, who lost about 1,100 IDF troopers in an 18-year occupation of south Lebanon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=218.8s)]
*  And again, having now inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, a prolonged Israeli presence in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  south Lebanon is guaranteed to regenerate popular support for the movement that they're out to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  defeat. So again, I would hope that the United States and this administration as a proven and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  trusted ally of Israel will be persuasive and that the prime minister will do what's in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=245.52s)]
*  best interest for regional peace and for Israel's own security interest. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Ambassador Ryan Crocker, it's certainly a cautionary tale. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=256.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. We appreciate your experience. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=259.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM6nytZjCI&t=275.52s)]
