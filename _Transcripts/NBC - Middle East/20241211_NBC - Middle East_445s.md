# Former CIA Director: Terrorists in Syria will ‘want to seek revenge’ against the U.S.
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8)
*  Joining us now is former CIA Director John Brennan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=0.0s)]
*  So there's a lot here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=3.0s)]
*  The Biden administration is considering removing the foreign terrorist designation from this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=4.72s)]
*  Syrian rebel group, HDS, according to two current administration officials who spoke [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=9.16s)]
*  with NBC News. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=13.88s)]
*  This is clearly an attempt to try to get some humanitarian aid in to stabilize the situation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=15.68s)]
*  But do you think that's wise in this context, to do this so quickly? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=22.56s)]
*  What do we have seen, whether Jelani really is going to be a moderate leader, granting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=27.4s)]
*  amnesty and including former Assad people in some future government? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, as Matt Bradley said, the situation is very unsettled. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=38.68s)]
*  I think there's great angst among a lot of Syrians about what the future holds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=42.44s)]
*  The Hayat Tahrir, a Shem organization, which is a coalition of various rebel groups, they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=46.92s)]
*  were united in their opposition to Assad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=53.2s)]
*  Well, Assad is no longer there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=55.2s)]
*  So the question now is, what is it that's going to hold them together? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=56.76s)]
*  Are they going to be united in terms of their approach to the governance of Syria? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  But the Syrian economy, society have been devastated because of a dozen, more than a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=65.0s)]
*  dozen years of rebellion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  And so this situation is going to remain chaotic for quite some time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=72.1s)]
*  And I think there are some extremist groups, radical Islamist extremist groups within this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=75.48s)]
*  HDS umbrella organization that will want to seek revenge inside of Syria and will engage [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=79.44s)]
*  in certain types of activities and violence that I think the United States government [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=85.92s)]
*  will have concerns about. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=90.2s)]
*  So I would urge caution at this point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=91.36s)]
*  There is a great uncertainty in terms of what is going to happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=94.08s)]
*  And so we'll have to see how this is going to evolve. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=97.92s)]
*  But right now, I think there's a big question as far as what will emerge in Damascus and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=101.0s)]
*  what it will do inside of Syria, as well as how it's going to look at its regional neighbors, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  including Israel, Palestinians and others. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=112.04s)]
*  Do you think it's premature, though, to lift that terror designation against Jelani and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=115.04s)]
*  the $10 million on his head, the reward, and deal with him? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=122.08s)]
*  Well, I think I would wait on the removal of the designation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=130.16s)]
*  You might want to remove the $10 million reward on him at this point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=133.08s)]
*  But I do think we have to wait and see what's going to happen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we've just been days since Assad's fall. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=142.0s)]
*  And so I think what we should do is to wait a bit and not be sort of just reacting in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=145.8s)]
*  the moment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=151.24s)]
*  I think we have to see where this goes and whether or not some of its rhetoric is going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=152.24s)]
*  to match actions in terms of moderation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=156.16s)]
*  But Jelani has made now publicly clear that he is going to seek to avenge some of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=159.16s)]
*  atrocities within the Syrian regime under Assad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=164.56s)]
*  We'll have to see how that plays out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Secretary Blinken is going to Jordan and to Turkey. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=171.08s)]
*  Erdogan's role is a major issue here, is it not? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  His power has really expanded. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, the Turks have been providing support to a number of these rebel groups in the north [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  of Syria. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=187.08s)]
*  And the HTS was located in the north of Syria in Idlib area and has been in control of that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=188.08s)]
*  area for a bit of time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=194.4s)]
*  And the Turks have provided support to it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  So there have been longstanding tensions between Turkey and Syria, between the Erdogan government [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=198.8s)]
*  and the Assad government. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  And so I'm sure Erdogan is pleased that Assad is no longer there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  But also I would think that the Turks need to be concerned about what's going to happen [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=209.8s)]
*  inside of Syria and whether or not this is going to be an issue that the Turks have to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  take into consideration when they think about their security along the very long border [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  that Turkey has with Syria. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post's David Ignatius is reporting today that among the people who may have helped [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=224.8s)]
*  HTS, their very rapid movements, is Ukraine providing some drones and some other military [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=230.8s)]
*  equipment to try to further embarrass Russia or hurt or damage Russia. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  Interesting? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=244.8s)]
*  It was interesting, but it's clear that both the Ukrainians and the rebel groups had a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=246.8s)]
*  common enemy, which was Russia, which was the main benefactor and supporter of the Assad [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=251.0s)]
*  regime. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=257.64s)]
*  So the Ukrainians have capabilities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=258.64s)]
*  I think the reports are that there were some drones, drone operators that were deployed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=260.52s)]
*  to Syria to help these rebels. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=264.84s)]
*  I don't think it was the major factor in terms of what led to the rapid collapse of the Syrian [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=267.2s)]
*  armed forces, but I think it was something that had helped the rebels. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=272.28s)]
*  I do think it was mainly the lack of support that the Assad regime was receiving from Russia, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=277.4s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah that led the Syrian military to just melt away. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=282.68s)]
*  And meanwhile, President Biden is reportedly considering preemptive pardons to people who [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  could be targeted by President-elect Trump's administration. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=293.88s)]
*  You were one of the people that might be on that list, sure. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=298.12s)]
*  Would you accept a pardon? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=301.64s)]
*  I don't think the folks who might be on a list are looking in any way for a pardon. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=304.2s)]
*  No, I would not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=310.2s)]
*  I believe that what I did during my government service and subsequent to it was certainly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=311.2s)]
*  fully consistent with the law. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=315.92s)]
*  And so therefore, despite some of the political winds that might be blowing here in the United [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=318.56s)]
*  States, I do have faith in the justice system. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=322.96s)]
*  And I'm hoping that the professionals within that judicial environment are going to continue [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=325.92s)]
*  to carry out their responsibilities irrespective of those political winds and any type of partisan [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=330.92s)]
*  pressure that they may face. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Trump has chosen Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to be his director of national intelligence. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=338.24s)]
*  She would, of course, present the president's or edit the president's daily brief, choose [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=344.44s)]
*  the briefer. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  There's a New York Times op-ed today by John Seifer and Michael Hayden, a former CIA and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  NSA leader, calling her, quote, wholly unqualified for the job. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=356.92s)]
*  Do you think she has the experience and the reliability for the job? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=361.6s)]
*  Well, she clearly doesn't have any intelligence community experience, so it raises questions [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=365.76s)]
*  about her qualifications, but also some of her very questionable actions and statements [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=370.88s)]
*  in the past in terms of her visits with Assad of Syria, her very sympathetic statements [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=376.88s)]
*  about Putin and Russia, her trafficking and conspiracy theories such as the bio weapons [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=382.76s)]
*  labs, U.S. bio weapons labs in Ukraine and the deep state and also the 2020 election. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=388.12s)]
*  It shows that she is really, I think, of questionable integrity as well as questionable judgment. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=394.52s)]
*  And somebody who heads up 18 intelligence community departments and agencies, they not [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=401.76s)]
*  only need to have those credentials and experience, but also you need to have confidence that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=406.68s)]
*  they're going to carry out their obligations and responsibilities with the highest integrity [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=410.6s)]
*  and honesty. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=414.8s)]
*  And so I think the confirmation process is going to, I think, reveal some real doubts [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=415.8s)]
*  along those lines in her background and resume. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKuVtwVMU8&t=421.84s)]
