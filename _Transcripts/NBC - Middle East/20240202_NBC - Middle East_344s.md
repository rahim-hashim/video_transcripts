# U.S. forces strike more than 85 targets in Syria and Iraq
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4)
*  What are you going to be watching for on the ground there in the next few days? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I think just picking up on your conversation there and a great point, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=6.0s)]
*  I think one of the issues, one of the questions is, which of these targets are in Syria and which are in Iraq? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=10.0s)]
*  Iraq is a much more delicate balance for exactly the reasons that you were just talking about, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=16.0s)]
*  because Iraq is both a partner of the US and a partner of Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=21.0s)]
*  The biggest danger is that if you over target, if you like, might not be the right way to describe it, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=26.0s)]
*  but if you overstep, perhaps you could put it that way, here in Iraq, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=32.0s)]
*  then you push the Iraqi government towards the Iranians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=36.0s)]
*  You perhaps encourage the voices of those who say that the US should leave Iraq. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=39.0s)]
*  And that is, of course, exactly the strategy of Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=45.0s)]
*  So that is one of the issues that the Biden administration will have been trying to weigh up [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=49.0s)]
*  when it calculates and made these plans for this mission tonight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=54.0s)]
*  But there is another aspect of this too, I think, to underscore, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=59.0s)]
*  and that is I think the breadth and the size of this campaign tonight [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=62.0s)]
*  actually underscores just how widespread Iranian influence is now in this region, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=67.0s)]
*  both particularly in Syria, where it has used the revolution in Syria, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=74.0s)]
*  then more recently it used somewhat of a withdrawal by the Russians to go and fight in Ukraine, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=81.0s)]
*  to take more ground in Syria, and then even the earthquake to take more. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=87.0s)]
*  So the Iranians are incredibly dug in, in Syria particularly, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=92.0s)]
*  and that is seen by Israel as an enormous threat. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=97.0s)]
*  The danger of opening another front for Israel is the way the Israelis view that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=102.0s)]
*  So all of this will come into sharp focus, I think, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=106.0s)]
*  simply by the fact of how extensive this campaign tonight appears to be. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=109.0s)]
*  And I think what that also underscores is how challenging this is for the US, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=114.0s)]
*  how challenging this is for the Biden administration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=118.0s)]
*  And Barry McCaffrey I think was really just kind of pointing towards the debate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=121.0s)]
*  about the numbers of US servicemen and women who are here, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=125.0s)]
*  whether they are sitting targets, what exactly their role is, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=130.0s)]
*  and whether if they did leave though, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=133.0s)]
*  that that would leave even more of the territory open to Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=135.0s)]
*  I mean, that is a conversation that hasn't been had, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=139.0s)]
*  and perhaps after this action, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=141.0s)]
*  because it will illuminate the many places that Iran is in this region, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=145.0s)]
*  perhaps that conversation, it will spur that kind of a conversation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=149.0s)]
*  But where we are now, we don't actually know exactly where. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=153.0s)]
*  We know the kind of targeting that has been carried out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=156.0s)]
*  We don't know what the targets are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=160.0s)]
*  Perhaps around Damascus Airport, perhaps around Aleppo Airport, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=163.0s)]
*  perhaps in eastern Syria, perhaps Iranian-backed militias here in Iraq. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=167.0s)]
*  Just to underscore again, why do we know why these might be some of the targets? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=172.0s)]
*  Because they've been targeted before by the Israelis and by the US. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=176.0s)]
*  And again, that just goes back to the point. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=180.0s)]
*  If you're trying to shift Iran's strategy to put pressure on Israel [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=182.0s)]
*  and push America out of this region, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=188.0s)]
*  then that is an incredibly difficult thing to do, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=190.0s)]
*  that particularly Israel has been trying to do, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=193.0s)]
*  and to some extent the US over many years. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=195.0s)]
*  And so far, Iran has stuck to that strategy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=198.0s)]
*  NBC's Kier Simmons for us in Iraq. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=202.0s)]
*  Kier, thank you so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=205.0s)]
*  I want to bring back into our conversation former CIA Director John Brennan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=206.0s)]
*  Director Brennan, I want you to pick up on where Kier left off, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=210.0s)]
*  Iran's widespread influence in the region, in Iraq and Syria, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=213.0s)]
*  how that then complicates things for the United States, for the Biden administration. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=218.0s)]
*  Well, one of the things in that CENTCOM statement that I think is quite clear [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=222.0s)]
*  was the very purposeful targeting of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Al-Quds Force. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=226.0s)]
*  The Al-Quds Force is that element of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=232.0s)]
*  that is embedded with these militia and proxy groups [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=235.0s)]
*  throughout Syria and Iraq and other areas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=238.0s)]
*  And so it's clear that these strikes are designed to take down [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=242.0s)]
*  a lot of those Al-Quds Force members, which are Iranians. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=246.0s)]
*  So although we may not be striking Iran itself, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=249.0s)]
*  we are striking at the heart of their ability to continue to work with these proxy militias. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=252.0s)]
*  So Iran has been a challenge to the United States in the Middle East over the past 40 years. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=257.0s)]
*  And so it continues to provide support to a number of these militia groups [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=263.0s)]
*  that operate in these ungoverned areas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=267.0s)]
*  There are large, large swaths of eastern Syria, western Iraq, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=270.0s)]
*  where the central governments have no control or influence over. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=273.0s)]
*  Iran has gone into those areas, cultivated ties with these local groups. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=277.0s)]
*  Mostly they're Shia, but they're also Sunni groups as well. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=281.0s)]
*  They've done that in those countries. They have done it in Yemen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=284.0s)]
*  They also did it, obviously, in Lebanon with Hezbollah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=287.0s)]
*  And Iran continues to see this as their opportunity to flex their muscles in the region. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=290.0s)]
*  And it really is something that is very much against U.S. interests. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=295.0s)]
*  It's against the interests of a lot of the countries in the region [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=299.0s)]
*  as far as trying to have some type of security and stability in the region. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=302.0s)]
*  So will this deter the Iranians from doing this? No, I don't think it will. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=306.0s)]
*  But the intention of these strikes is to seriously degrade the ability of the Quds Force [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=310.0s)]
*  to continue to work with these proxy groups [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=316.0s)]
*  and to degrade the capabilities of these militias to carry out attacks against U.S. forces. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=319.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGmrqvkizg4&t=332.0s)]
