# ‘Has to be a resolution immediately’: Rep. Kamlager-Dove calls for ceasefire amid Israel protests
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE)
*  Joining me now our friend congresswoman Sydney Comelager Dove, Democrat from California, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=0.0s)]
*  member of the Foreign Affairs and Natural Resources Committees, and surrogate for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=4.96s)]
*  Harris Walls campaign. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=8.48s)]
*  Welcome back to the broadcast, congresswoman. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=10.66s)]
*  So has your committee, first of all, been briefed on this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=12.24s)]
*  And if so, what can you share with us? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=15.48s)]
*  Well, I do want to say this is an unthinkable tragedy and unthinkable suffering that is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=17.6s)]
*  happening. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=24.48s)]
*  My heart goes out to the families. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=25.48s)]
*  We have been getting briefed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  I actually met with the families last month in Washington, D.C., and we all agreed that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=28.32s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization and that no better deal will come tomorrow and that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=33.76s)]
*  diplomacy is key. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=39.4s)]
*  And so now what we're seeing, protests in Israel, there's a polio outbreak in Gaza, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=40.84s)]
*  there's a deal point over corridor control on Egypt's borders. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=46.2s)]
*  But we know that every day a ceasefire deal with the release of hostages does not happen [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=50.92s)]
*  is a day that hostages and civilians' lives are at risk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=54.64s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=58.76s)]
*  Vice President Harris shared on social media that she has spoken with Hirsch Goldberg Poland's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=59.76s)]
*  family. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=64.4s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how that conversation went? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=65.4s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=69.16s)]
*  You know, the family came to the DNC and really wore their heart on their sleeve. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=70.16s)]
*  They talked about the importance of bringing home the hostages alive and getting a deal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=74.32s)]
*  They also talked about the healing enclosure that has to happen around the world and in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  this country as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=83.8s)]
*  I don't know if you're able to see the screen, but we are showing our viewers these incredible [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=87.52s)]
*  clashes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=91.72s)]
*  There's a lot of energy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=92.72s)]
*  There are thousands upon thousands, reportedly as many as half a million people throughout [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=94.16s)]
*  Israel right now that are protesting the just murderous deaths of these six hostages, but [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=99.4s)]
*  also protesting Benjamin Netanyahu and his government for allowing this to happen by [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=105.92s)]
*  not getting to a ceasefire. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=112.78s)]
*  Give me a sense of your interpretation of what's happening in Israel and what the U.S. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=117.0s)]
*  can do to help bring about a resolution that it's not already trying to do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=123.92s)]
*  How much can, how much is the U.S. able to help influence Israel? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=129.2s)]
*  So when we met with the families, they were very clear that every day a ceasefire deal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=135.68s)]
*  is not agreed to is a day that their family members are at risk. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=142.0s)]
*  And so you have to use diplomacy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=146.72s)]
*  It cannot be just military. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=148.64s)]
*  We know that the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have been at the negotiating table trying to work [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=150.54s)]
*  to a resolution. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=155.76s)]
*  We know that there are sticking points. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=157.2s)]
*  Sometimes it feels like the ball keeps moving, but I think everyone at the table is incredibly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=159.64s)]
*  committed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=164.24s)]
*  I can't tell you how many discussions I've had with ambassadors from Jordan, from Qatar, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=165.24s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, and everyone is on the same page. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=169.28s)]
*  There has to be a resolution to this immediately so that healing, so that closure, so that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=172.72s)]
*  greater diplomacy, so that a framework for peace can happen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=177.44s)]
*  You know, there was an example given earlier on the broadcast. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=182.28s)]
*  We all remember when those Russians that have been Americans rather wrongly imprisoned in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=186.17999999999998s)]
*  Russia were brought home as a result of President Biden and his nonstop negotiations. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=192.16s)]
*  Perhaps the vice president was involved in those as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=197.88s)]
*  That was a deal that he made to secure their release. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Multi-country effort to do that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=203.52s)]
*  It was an extraordinary thing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=206.2s)]
*  He made that deal, locked it up on the day that he announced that he would be stepping [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  aside from the campaign and not continuing his run for president. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=213.26s)]
*  There are some who are hoping that there's something as big, as prominent as that, that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=218.46s)]
*  is underway right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=224.36s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=226.76s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  It is important to say that the circumstances and the landscape is incredibly different, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=231.0s)]
*  right, when we're talking about Russia and Ukraine and Eastern Europe versus what's happening [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=241.12s)]
*  But I can tell you, Foreign Affairs Committee, we have had repeated conversations with all [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=242.12s)]
*  parties involved. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=247.6s)]
*  Regional escalation is something everyone is thinking about. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=249.68s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah trying to activate is something everyone is watching very closely [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=252.64s)]
*  and stabilization of that region. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  It has incredible impacts for economy as well as for national security. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=260.0s)]
*  And I think people are walking into this, continue to walk into this eyes wide open. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=268.08s)]
*  I know I brought you on to talk about politics. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=269.08s)]
*  Unfortunately, since you're a friend of the show, you're going to continue to return and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=270.96s)]
*  talk about politics. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=273.76s)]
*  But I do want to ask you one more question, which yesterday, BP Harris shared this post [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=274.76s)]
*  about her upbringing and working at McDonald's. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=281.36s)]
*  And then within minutes, Donald Trump reacted, claiming she never worked there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=283.76s)]
*  I mean, we've seen quite a bit of back and forth between both campaigns this weekend [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=288.56s)]
*  via social media. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=292.56s)]
*  Is this the new frontier and the fight for voters? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=293.92s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=298.48s)]
*  But as we prepare for the debate, I know that we're going to see two people on the stage, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=299.48s)]
*  a woman who's going to tell you the truth and an orange man who's going to lie to you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=303.72s)]
*  I hope he gets his act together, although we know that these tired tactics of his are to be expected. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=308.08s)]
*  I think this is a litmus test for how he will continue to govern. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  It shows you how he has cannibalized the Republican Party and made them incredibly dysfunctional. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  And it shows you why we need to be talking about our values and really supporting Vice [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=322.24s)]
*  President Kamala Harris to help her win in November. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  Congresswoman Sydney Komlaugher-Dubb of California, thank you so much. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=329.4s)]
*  We'll see you again soon. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=332.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VqIxb4TAE&t=337.08s)]
