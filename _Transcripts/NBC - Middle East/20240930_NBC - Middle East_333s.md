# Hezbollah that existed before leader was killed 'does not exist anymore'
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk)
*  Hezbollah's acting leader is vowing to continue the fight against Israel, warning that the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=0.0s)]
*  terror group is ready for a long war, even after a series of devastating strikes wiped [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=4.48s)]
*  out much of its top command. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=9.8s)]
*  That includes Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader, killed in a blast in Beirut [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=12.0s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=16.64s)]
*  Here's Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=17.64s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah was a brutal terrorist, whose many victims included Americans, Israelis, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=22.0s)]
*  civilians in Lebanon, civilians in Syria, and many others as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=31.04s)]
*  During his leadership of Hezbollah, the group terrorized people across the region and prevented [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=36.56s)]
*  Lebanon from fully moving forward as a country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=43.04s)]
*  Lebanon, the region, the world, are safer without him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=46.88s)]
*  Joining us now, Matthew Levitt, director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=53.68s)]
*  Intelligence and author of Hezbollah, the global footprint of Lebanon's party of God. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=57.32s)]
*  It's so good to have you here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=63.2s)]
*  Look, obviously, Hezbollah lost Nasrallah, they lost their headquarters, they lost multiple [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=64.68s)]
*  commanders, they were reeling from those walkie talkie and pager explosions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=69.88s)]
*  So what is the status of this terror organization now? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=75.12s)]
*  Do you see them recovering? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me on the show. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Look, Hezbollah that existed eight, nine days ago does not exist anymore. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  It may be able to recover in time, but that would take a significant amount of time because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=89.92s)]
*  we're not talking about a decapitation strategy here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=93.76s)]
*  We're not talking about just the loss of Nasrallah himself, which is significant. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=96.92s)]
*  We're talking about open heart surgery. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the loss of their headquarters command center. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=102.36s)]
*  We're talking about not just the top, but the second, third and fourth tier of their [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=106.72s)]
*  operational commanders gone. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=110.68s)]
*  We're talking about the loss of significant amount that we don't know how much, but a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=112.9s)]
*  significant amount of their launchers and their rockets, their communications. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=117.48s)]
*  They are not as prepared today as they were just a few days ago to fight a full scale [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=128.32s)]
*  And it's not clear that they will recover and become the kind of pearl in the network [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=129.88s)]
*  of Iranian proxies that they have been until just a few days ago. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=135.2s)]
*  And so they're very dangerous. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=140.56s)]
*  They've been shooting rockets at Israel even just in the past few minutes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=142.32s)]
*  And there's a potential even for Iran to get involved in the mix. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=145.54s)]
*  But the Hezbollah that we knew no longer exists. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=148.56s)]
*  So they have been sending more than 100 rockets a day into Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=152.18s)]
*  Most all of them are shot down by the Iron Dome. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=156.28s)]
*  But what is the extent of their capabilities? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=158.8s)]
*  Do we even really know? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=161.44s)]
*  No we don't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=164.72s)]
*  We know that Hezbollah had extensive tunnel networks and some of those have been destroyed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=165.94s)]
*  We have no idea how many. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=169.84s)]
*  There are reports that the IDF has been sending in commando units to southern Lebanon to destroy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=171.56s)]
*  those. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=175.36s)]
*  And of course reports today that the IDF plans to go just across the border and take out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=176.36s)]
*  Hezbollah capabilities in the villages and towns there where they built up infrastructure [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=179.96s)]
*  over the past few years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=184.68s)]
*  We know that the Israelis have gone to great lengths to take out their rockets and their [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=186.28s)]
*  launchers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=190.04s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=191.12s)]
*  I don't know if the Israelis have an idea really of how much of that they've taken out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=192.12s)]
*  But even if they've taken out as much as 50 percent of Hezbollah's rocket capabilities, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=195.76s)]
*  that leaves about 75,000 different types of projectiles. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  What the Israelis really want to do is to take out and focus on the medium and long [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=203.4s)]
*  range rockets, which are the larger strategic threat to Israel than the shorter range ones [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=207.16s)]
*  that they've been using over the past 11 and a half months targeting northern Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=213.3s)]
*  Well you mentioned Iran and Hezbollah of course was built in part to help defend Iran and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=218.94s)]
*  for years it was considered the most powerful Iranian proxy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=222.86s)]
*  But according to the Washington Post, the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, quote, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=226.86s)]
*  eviscerated decades of myths and assumptions about Hezbollah's military might along with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=230.86s)]
*  the stature on the organization as a regional powerhouse. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=235.74s)]
*  What does it mean for Iran's so-called axis of resistance for Hezbollah to be so thoroughly [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=240.14s)]
*  humbled? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  So look, Iran helped create Hezbollah in the get go in the early 1980s, that's true, but [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=247.7s)]
*  not to be part of the defense for Iran. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=252.26s)]
*  That's a misnomer. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  It was actually the opposite, to be an offensive capability because the Iranian revolution [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=255.45999999999998s)]
*  was never intended to end at the borders of Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  It was intended to be exported and that started with Hezbollah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=261.86s)]
*  Over the past few years in particular, Hezbollah has become a leader of Iran's axis of resistance, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=265.54s)]
*  as they put it, their network of proxies, providing support to Shia militias in Iraq, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=272.5s)]
*  to the Houthis in Yemen, to militants in Syria, and of course to the Palestinians as well, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=278.16s)]
*  Hamas, Islamic Jihad. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=283.86s)]
*  Losing Hamas is one thing, losing Hezbollah is something completely different and literally [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  is taking out the crown jewel from Iran's proxy network. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=292.06s)]
*  And it suggests a significant degradation of the capabilities of that network, the most [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=296.9s)]
*  capable of which after Hezbollah is quite far away from Israel in Iraq. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  Matthew Levitt, your expertise is invaluable right now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=307.42s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the program. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=310.62s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KMUDih_7Dk&t=312.14s)]
