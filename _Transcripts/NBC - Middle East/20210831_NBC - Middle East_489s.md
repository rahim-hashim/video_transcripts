# As U.S. Leaves Afghanistan, Congressman Advocates For Residual Force In Region
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs)
*  Joining us now Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=0.0s)]
*  Prior to being elected to Congress, he served in the Air Force in Operation Iraqi Freedom [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=3.2s)]
*  and then Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=7.8s)]
*  He's a pilot in the Air National Guard with the current rank of Lieutenant Colonel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=11.24s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for being with us this morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=15.56s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=17.46s)]
*  I'm interested in your thoughts as someone who served in Afghanistan about the end of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=18.46s)]
*  mission there yesterday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, real quick on the Ramstein piece, it's interesting because I remember [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=24.28s)]
*  in 2006 being on the ground there as a pilot and watching all the bodies moved because [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=29.08s)]
*  that was really the height of, you know, our casualties in Iraq. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=34.2s)]
*  And so when I was listening to that report, it kind of brought that home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  But look, I mean, on the micro level, it's a relief. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=39.96s)]
*  Yesterday's a relief because I, like a lot of people, were wondering what happens when [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=44.04s)]
*  you're down to one plane load of soldiers left, you know, Marines left and the danger. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=48.84s)]
*  On the other hand, I'm very irate and I'm trying to keep my emotions in check because [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=54.279999999999994s)]
*  I think as a legislator, we have to move forward with kind of a cold approach to what do we [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=59.68s)]
*  do right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=64.8s)]
*  What do we do wrong? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=65.8s)]
*  But I feel like we've betrayed Americans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=66.8s)]
*  I feel like the fact that we were defending an urban airport in the middle of a city with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=68.6s)]
*  one runway shows that this whole mission went wrong from the beginning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=74.22s)]
*  And I frankly think that we have fallen prey, fallen victim to the, you know, the lolling [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=78.88s)]
*  of politicians like Rand Paul using terms like endless wars and unfortunately haven't [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=85.72s)]
*  had strong leadership reminding America of what could happen in Afghanistan if we leave. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=91.3s)]
*  So what does that look like in a better scenario to you, Congressman? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=97.64s)]
*  We've heard many, many experts, including some leaks from the current Department of Defense [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=100.84s)]
*  from leadership saying we wanted to keep a force of 2,500 or 3,000 American troops in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan the way we keep troops in Japan and South Korea and Germany. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=110.0s)]
*  What does a good American troop presence, what does a good end to this war look like [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=114.52s)]
*  to you? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=118.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I think this is important to talk about now, Willie, because, you know, we're [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=119.68s)]
*  going to have these questions going forward and you're going to have people that try to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=123.56s)]
*  say, oh, well, now's not the time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  It is the time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=128.28s)]
*  It wasn't when we had troops sit in the middle of Kabul, but now is that time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=129.28s)]
*  And I think what it would have looked like as a residual force, the military actually [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=133.24s)]
*  recommended like 3,500. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  And keep in mind, we've had over 100,000 there many times since 2014. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  The combat missions were being done by the Afghan military. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  But when you have the prior president and this president from the very beginning saying [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=145.8s)]
*  the war is not worth it, we're going to leave and then, you know, giving Pompeo over to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  negotiate with the Taliban as President Trump is saying this war is not worth it, it's not [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=154.52s)]
*  There's no wonder he got rolled like Neville Chamberlain in this and got a really bad deal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=159.74s)]
*  And so I would have left a residual force. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=164.78s)]
*  And I think even when you saw the Afghan government falling and collapsing, keep in mind, a lot [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=166.86s)]
*  of these Afghan military leaders were getting these night letters from the Taliban that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  said the U.S. is going to abandon you and we're going to kill your family and we know [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=175.02s)]
*  where you live. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=178.58s)]
*  And that's part of the reason that they melted so quickly, because we did then abandon them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=179.58s)]
*  But once I saw everything falling, I think America should have rushed troops to defend [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=185.1s)]
*  the Kabul proper, defend the city. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=189.34s)]
*  The Taliban had no intention of coming into Kabul until the president basically fled and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=192.1s)]
*  all defense forces of Kabul collapsed and the Taliban kind of walked in. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=197.5s)]
*  I would have defended that till we got everybody out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=202.38s)]
*  But look, it is where we are now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=204.62s)]
*  But there's a lot of answers I think we need. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=206.26s)]
*  As you know, President Biden, he's going to speak today in just a few hours to the country, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=210.54s)]
*  but he has stood fast with his deadline and saying, I'm going to be the president that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=214.1s)]
*  ends this war. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=217.54s)]
*  20 years is enough. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=218.82s)]
*  I don't want to see another American die like 13 just did on Thursday. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=220.18s)]
*  What do you make of his argument that it is time to go? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=224.9s)]
*  It is time to go and this is messy and it's painful, but it had to end. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  Look if he truly believes that that's one thing, if it's for politics, that's another. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he truly believes it's time to leave. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=237.94s)]
*  Let me point out, as we're leaving Afghanistan, we get nipped by ISIS-K, a drastic hit right [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=241.58s)]
*  to the face, kills 13 Marines, injures dozens more. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=248.38s)]
*  The Taliban we know now have under protection one of Osama Bin Laden's former guys. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=252.02s)]
*  So if there's this idea that now the Taliban is going to be the savior of us against ISIS-K, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=258.82s)]
*  it's not true. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=263.52s)]
*  But here's the point I want to make and I think this is the key to all of it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=265.3s)]
*  For politicians it is super easy to stand in front of people and tell them what they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=269.26s)]
*  want to hear. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=272.53999999999996s)]
*  And this goes to members of Congress, even my colleagues and friends that were all for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump leaving Afghanistan but are not for Biden leaving Afghanistan. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  The fact is being a leader means you have to lead and convince people sometimes of things [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=283.34s)]
*  they don't want to hear. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=287.9s)]
*  And when Rand Paul says endless wars and he does like your grandma used to do, tell you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=288.9s)]
*  how tired you were and eventually you feel tired because she keeps telling you you're [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=293.06s)]
*  tired over and over. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=296.54s)]
*  Like America needs to remember that the greatest generation that won World War II that we're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=297.54s)]
*  so proud of, we have to be able to stick to fight sometimes even when they go along. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=302.38s)]
*  And I wish this wasn't the case. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=308.06s)]
*  I wish I could stand and say it's time to bring everybody home. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  But I'm afraid and I hope I'm wrong, I'm afraid I'm not. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=312.94s)]
*  Well what happens next then? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  What are you afraid of precisely, Congressman? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  American troops out of the country, there is no residual force as you've called for. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=321.38s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=325.6s)]
*  What are your fears out of Afghanistan? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=326.6s)]
*  Well, so it's two things. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  Number one, the psychological benefit that goes to terror groups from us running is innumerable. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=330.56s)]
*  So this is a huge recruiting area for ISIS-K, for ISIS in Iraq and Syria, for Al-Qaeda, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=336.36s)]
*  for Al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula because they just made the U.S. run. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=342.44s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  Number two, if you think the Taliban is willing to cut a deal with the United States but not [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=348.12s)]
*  and ISIS to survive as they're trying to govern their country, they will cut a deal. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=353.78s)]
*  They will allow ISIS and Al-Qaeda a place to breathe, place to train, and everything [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=357.94s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  My biggest fear is within two, five, ten years they strike out against the U.S. homeland [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=362.85999999999996s)]
*  again, against our allies. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=368.78s)]
*  And by the way, all this talk about over the horizon capability, no military person with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  a straight face will tell you that is anything near effective as having a few troops on the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  ground. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  How do we defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  We had troops embedded with indigenous forces. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=382.74s)]
*  We didn't just do it by flying a couple of planes over and thinking that truck we see [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=386.06s)]
*  might be ISIS. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=389.26s)]
*  Congressman, Mike Barnicle's got a question for you, Mike. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=391.26s)]
*  Hey, Mike. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=394.98s)]
*  So Congressman, do you think that Al-Qaeda is as strong or nearly as strong today in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=396.58s)]
*  Afghanistan as it was on September 10th, 2001? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=404.02s)]
*  Or do you think that Al-Qaeda is stronger and more global in parts of Africa and other [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=408.86s)]
*  parts of the Middle East? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=414.38s)]
*  Well, look, you know, it's a tough question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=416.38s)]
*  Al-Qaeda's certainly spread out more. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=419.38s)]
*  And if you add ISIS to the mix and we see, you know, the growth of ISIS and the fact [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=421.38s)]
*  that it wants to do these kind of big, spectacular attacks, I think as of today they're probably [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  significantly degraded, Al-Qaeda is, from what they were on September 10th. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=431.22s)]
*  But the problem is they can grow and groups like them can grow because it's not even the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=435.74s)]
*  name of the group I think that matters. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8AgwcICrvs&t=439.26s)]
