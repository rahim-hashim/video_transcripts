Video Description: Amnesty International has released a landmark report that concludes Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. This comes on the heels of the International Criminal Court filing arrest warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and numerous human rights groups documenting other war crimes and human rights abuses. As the international consensus builds around this case, the United States and powerful western allies continue to back Israel’s actions. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin is joined by Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard to discuss the report, the criticisms of it, and what comes next.

# Amnesty International chief on how organization concluded Israel is committing genocide in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y)
*  Joining me now is Agnes Kalamard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Agnes, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  I want to start with perhaps one of the most important points of this report, and that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=4.64s)]
*  is the question of intent, which centers on the stated intent and the definition of genocide. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  What this critique gets to, that some have been making of this report, is that Israel [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=18.44s)]
*  vehemently denies the intent that Amnesty International and others say is genocide. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=22.56s)]
*  Israel claims it has two legitimate military goals, which are a, fighting Hamas, fighting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=30.68s)]
*  to eliminate Hamas, and trying to free its hostages. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=35.68s)]
*  If they have those as their stated goals, their stated intent, how did you, Amnesty [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=39.72s)]
*  International, get to the conclusion that they are committing a genocide? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=45.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  First and foremost, it's important to insist on the fact that having military objectives [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  does not negate having other intent, including genocidal intent. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=59.04s)]
*  It is, after all, an armed conflict, so we would expect a party to the conflict, indeed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=63.64s)]
*  all parties to the conflict, to have military objectives, including to get rid of Hamas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=68.96s)]
*  What we have done is looked at the evidence collected over 12 months and determined whether [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=76.22s)]
*  that evidence of crimes could be explained by a military objective in relation to Hamas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=83.74s)]
*  What we have found is that it is impossible to reach the conclusion that those repeated [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=91.5s)]
*  acts can be explained by the presence of Hamas, including the presence of Hamas within [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=98.1s)]
*  civilian infrastructures. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=107.06s)]
*  I can list a large number of repeated acts that point to another intention, not a military [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=108.82s)]
*  intention. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=118.13999999999999s)]
*  I can point to the repeated attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructures without [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=119.13999999999999s)]
*  any military objectives and military necessity. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  We've investigated 15 of such attacks where there were no Hamas positions at the time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=130.6s)]
*  We have investigated, as have others, the repeated use of very large weapons, which [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=138.36s)]
*  in such an urban setting are bound to result into the greatest number of casualties. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=145.44s)]
*  We have pointed out, as have others, the fact that those weapons are used at times [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=152.78s)]
*  where they can have the greatest number of casualties, that is, at night. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  We have shown that the vast majority of farming lands has been razed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=165.26s)]
*  We have shown that the vast number of bakeries have been destroyed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=170.94s)]
*  There is no water infrastructure left in Gaza right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=176.5s)]
*  People cannot drink drinkable water. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=181.26s)]
*  People cannot eat. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=184.82s)]
*  There is only humanitarian aid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=185.82s)]
*  We have shown the destruction of hospitals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=189.84s)]
*  We have shown that people cannot get cured for basic or complicated diseases. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  Doctors cannot practice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  Surgeons cannot operate because there is nothing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  That and many more evidence point to the fact if it was only one time, if it was only one [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=207.22s)]
*  attack against a civilian, you could say it's an accident. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=215.46s)]
*  But when those attacks are happening over 14 months, if it was only one piece of land, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  a farmable land that had been destroyed, you could say, OK, it's reckless. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=226.38s)]
*  But when the entire farming lands have been destroyed, that cannot be reckless anymore. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=230.74s)]
*  So all these over 14 months repeated time and time again can point to only one intent, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=236.86s)]
*  which is that of destroying the Palestinians of Gaza in war or in part. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=246.06s)]
*  Let me just stay on the criticism issue of the report for one more question. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  And that is, unlike the International Criminal Court, which charged both leaders of Israel [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=255.66s)]
*  and leaders of Hamas with war crimes, Amnesty International only makes the case against [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel here, even though, of course, as Israel and others have stated and noted, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=266.28s)]
*  Hamas is charged or calls for the destruction of Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=270.44s)]
*  And obviously, what they claim were genocidal acts on October 7th. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=274.11999999999995s)]
*  Yes, we have denounced the atrocity crimes committed by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=280.2s)]
*  In fact, we are investigating them and putting the same time and resources that we have put [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=287.64s)]
*  into investigating the genocide. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=295.0s)]
*  We are doing that now on the atrocity crimes committed on October 7th. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=297.24s)]
*  The reason why we have prioritized the genocide in Gaza is because it's ongoing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=303.16s)]
*  There are people dying as we speak. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=310.68s)]
*  During the duration of our interviews, people will die because there is a genocide. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=312.84s)]
*  The urgency of stopping the genocide is what prompted us to prioritize the investigation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  into this ongoing 14-month-old genocide broadcasted in front of our very eyes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  Let me ask you about the United States in this for a moment, because obviously, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=333.88s)]
*  as you're suggesting in your report, Israel's committing genocide. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Does the United States bear any responsibility in your assessment for that genocide? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  Is the United States effectively complicit in genocide because it has continued to arm [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=347.88s)]
*  and equip the Israeli military unabatedly? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  Threshold of complicity under international law is very high, and we have not yet made [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=359.48s)]
*  that determination. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=364.2s)]
*  But what is very clear is that the United States is confronting the serious risk of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=365.8s)]
*  being complicit in the crime of genocide, particularly through the repeated sale of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=372.6s)]
*  weapons, transfer of military equipment to Israel, some of which have been used to target [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=379.56s)]
*  civilians. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  So, of course, the risk of being complicit is extremely, extremely high. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=389.72s)]
*  The United States has shielded Israel in the Security Council. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  It has prevented the Security Council from being able to act. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=401.64s)]
*  So that, too, is another element pointing to the risk of complicity. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  Whether or not what the U.S. has done meets the threshold of complicity under international law, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  it is very clear that the United States has failed in its obligation to prevent genocide. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=420.84s)]
*  It's already clear. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=427.96s)]
*  It has failed in its international obligation to prevent genocide. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=429.56s)]
*  Let me ask you about how this report has been received, certainly in Western capitals. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=434.68s)]
*  And of course, some of Amnesty International's most recent reports were about Russia's crackdown [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=438.44s)]
*  of dissent or on dissent, the execution crisis in Iran, the use of torture inside Syria. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=443.32s)]
*  Is there a double standard in how Amnesty International reports are used and cited by [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=451.16s)]
*  Western countries when the reports are critical of countries like Russia, Iran, and Syria, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=456.04s)]
*  and this report about Israel committing genocide in Gaza? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=466.76000000000005s)]
*  It is the sky in the summer blue. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=467.56s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  There are lots of double standards in the response of Western countries to our report, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  including our reports on Israel genocide in Gaza. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=479.72s)]
*  There are lots of double standards in the way Western countries responded to the International [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=483.4s)]
*  Criminal Court arrest warrant against Prime Minister Netanyahu, going as far as threatening [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=489.08s)]
*  the prosecutor, the judge, and the International Criminal Court of sanctions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  Something extremely grave, extremely grave. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=504.12s)]
*  The International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  are some of the only institutions left to keep the rule-based order working, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=512.04s)]
*  because the Security Council, frankly, is completely ineffective right now. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=518.84s)]
*  And for the United States to attack those institutions, the United States is a very [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=523.16s)]
*  architect of the post-World War II system. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=530.04s)]
*  How can they go after the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=533.16s)]
*  that are currently holding that rule-based order system in place? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=539.0s)]
*  So double standards everywhere indeed. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=545.88s)]
*  Let me ask you finally, Agnes, about why did you, out of all of the times that Amnesty [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=548.68s)]
*  International has issued reports and other conflicts, this was the first time, I believe, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=554.92s)]
*  that you have issued as an organization a report declaring a genocide, not in Sudan, not in Myanmar. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=558.92s)]
*  Why did you feel this one was the time that you came out, needed to come out and say, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=565.8s)]
*  there is a genocide taking place, where previously in other conflicts you have refrained, even [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=571.08s)]
*  though you've used the language, you have refrained from issuing a report declaring a genocide? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=576.6s)]
*  Quite the case. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=583.24s)]
*  We have declared genocide in Rwanda, in Cambodia, in Guatemala. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=586.52s)]
*  And in the former Yugoslavia. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=595.8s)]
*  Amnesty International has based its determination of genocide on the work of others. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=599.08s)]
*  On that occasion, in the case of Gaza, we have actually done our own research to reach [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=608.12s)]
*  the conclusion of genocide. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=614.76s)]
*  So yes, it is a new investigation for Amnesty International. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=617.48s)]
*  It is not the first time that we are declaring that a situation amounts to a genocide, but it [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=624.28s)]
*  is the first time that we have investigated it as much as we have done over 14 months, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=630.92s)]
*  painstakingly collecting evidence and doing legal analysis. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  Sadly, it won't be the last, and we are currently considering undertaking similar [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=644.76s)]
*  research in two situations. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=651.56s)]
*  All right, Agnes Calamart, Secretary General of Amnesty International, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=653.88s)]
*  thank you so much for your time and insights tonight. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7ip2kir1Y&t=661.2399999999999s)]
