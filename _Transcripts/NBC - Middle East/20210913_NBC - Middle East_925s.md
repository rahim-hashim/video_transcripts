# Blinken Blames Trump, Congress For Afghan Visa Backlog
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8)
*  Thank you. For today, I welcome this opportunity to discuss our policy on Afghanistan, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  where we are, and where we're going in the weeks and months ahead. For 20 years, Congress [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  has conducted oversight and provided funding for the mission in Afghanistan. I know from [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=16.04s)]
*  my own time as a staff member for then-Senator Biden how invaluable a partner Congress is. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=21.28s)]
*  As I said when I was nominated, I believe strongly in Congress's traditional role as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=28.24s)]
*  a partner in foreign policymaking. I'm committed to working with you on the path forward in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=32.44s)]
*  Afghanistan and to advance the interests of the American people. On this 20th anniversary [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=37.56s)]
*  of 9-11, as we honor the nearly 3,000 men, women, and children who lost their lives, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=43.56s)]
*  we're reminded why we went to Afghanistan in the first place, to bring justice to those [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=50.28s)]
*  who attacked us, and to ensure that it would not happen again. We achieved those objectives [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=55.92s)]
*  long ago. Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011, a decade ago. Al-Qaeda's capabilities were [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  degraded significantly, including its ability to plan and conduct external operations. After [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=69.48s)]
*  20 years, 2,641 American lives lost, 20,000 injuries, $2 trillion spent, it was time to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=76.24s)]
*  end America's longest war. When President Biden took office in January, he inherited [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  an agreement that his predecessor had reached with the Taliban to remove all remaining forces [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  from Afghanistan by May 1st of this year. As part of that agreement, the previous administration [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=97.44s)]
*  pressed the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including some top [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=103.28s)]
*  war commanders. Meanwhile, it reduced our own force presence to 2,500 troops. In return, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  the Taliban agreed to stop attacking U.S. and partner forces, and to refrain from threatening [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan's major cities. But the Taliban continued a relentless march on remote outposts, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=121.12s)]
*  checkpoints, on villages and districts, as well as the major roads connecting them. By [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=127.48s)]
*  January 2021, the Taliban was in the strongest military position it had been in since 9-11, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=133.32s)]
*  and we had the smallest number of troops on the ground since 2001. As a result, upon taking [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=140.76s)]
*  office, President Biden immediately faced the choice between ending the war or escalating [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=147.76s)]
*  it. Had he not followed through on his predecessor's commitment, attacks on our forces and those [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=154.24s)]
*  of our allies would have resumed, and the Taliban's nationwide assaults on Afghanistan's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=160.84s)]
*  major cities would have commenced. That would have required sending substantially more U.S. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=165.56s)]
*  forces into Afghanistan to defend themselves and prevent a Taliban takeover, taking casualties, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=171.24s)]
*  and with at best the prospect of restoring a stalemate and remaining stuck in Afghanistan [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=179.6s)]
*  under fire indefinitely. There's no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=185.2s)]
*  security forces or the Afghan government any more resilient or self-sustaining. If 20 years [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=191.88s)]
*  and hundreds of billions of dollars in support, equipment and training did not suffice, why [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=199.0s)]
*  would another year, another five, another 10? Conversely, there is nothing that our strategic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=203.7s)]
*  competitors like China and Russia or adversaries like Iran and North Korea would have liked more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=212.17999999999998s)]
*  than for the United States to re-up a 20-year war and remain bogged down in Afghanistan for another [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=217.5s)]
*  decade. In advance of the President's decision, I was in constant contact with our allies and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=223.38s)]
*  partners to hear their views and factor them into our thinking. When the President announced [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=229.66s)]
*  the withdrawal, NATO immediately and unanimously embraced it. We all sat together on the drawdown. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=234.9s)]
*  Similarly, we were intensely focused on the safety of Americans in Afghanistan. In March, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  we began urging them to leave the country. In total, between March and August, we sent 19 [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=250.46s)]
*  specific messages with that warning and with offers to help, including financial assistance [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=259.02s)]
*  to pay for plane tickets. Despite this effort, at the time the evacuation began, there were [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  still thousands of American citizens in Afghanistan, almost all of whom we evacuated by August 31st. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=271.29999999999995s)]
*  Many were dual citizens living in Afghanistan for years, decades, generations, deciding whether or [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  not to leave the place they know as home was an incredibly wrenching decision. In April, we began [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=287.38s)]
*  drawing down our embassy, ordering non-essential personnel to depart. We also used this time to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=294.7s)]
*  significantly speed up the processing of the special immigrant visas for Afghans who had worked [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=301.3s)]
*  for us and by our side these past 20 years. When we took office, we inherited a program with a 14-step [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=306.78s)]
*  process based on a statutory framework enacted by Congress and involving multiple government [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  agencies and a backlog of more than 17,000 SIV applicants. There had not been a single interview [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=320.98s)]
*  in the SIV program in Kabul for nine months going back to March of 2020. The program was basically [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  in a stall. Within two weeks of taking office, we restarted the SIV interview process in Kabul. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=334.66s)]
*  On February 4th, one of the very first executive orders issued by President Biden directed us to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=341.82s)]
*  immediately review the SIV program to identify causes of undue delay and to find ways to process [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=347.42s)]
*  SIV applications more quickly. This spring, I directed significant additional resources to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=353.1s)]
*  the program, expanding the team in Washington of people processing applications from 10 to 50 [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=359.1s)]
*  and doubling the number of SIV adjudicators at our embassy in Kabul. Even as many embassy [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  personnel returned to the United States under order departure, we sent more consular officers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=370.3s)]
*  to Kabul to process SIV applications. As a result of these and other steps, including working with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=375.42s)]
*  Congress, by May we had reduced the average processing time for special immigrant visas [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=382.22s)]
*  by more than a year. Even amid a COVID surge at embassy Kabul in June, we continued to issue visas [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  and we went from issuing about 100 special immigrant visas per week in March [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=394.7s)]
*  to more than 1,000 per week in August when our evacuation and relocation efforts began. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=398.86s)]
*  That emergency evacuation was sparked by the collapse of the Afghan security forces and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=405.74s)]
*  government. Throughout the year, we were constantly assessing their staying power [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=410.46s)]
*  and considering multiple scenarios. Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=415.26s)]
*  that government forces in Kabul would collapse while U.S. forces remained. As General Milley, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said, nothing I or anyone else saw [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=427.42s)]
*  indicated a collapse of this army and this government in 11 days. Nonetheless, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=432.3s)]
*  we planned and exercised a wide range of contingencies. Because of that planning, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=439.18s)]
*  we were able to draw down our embassy and move our remaining personnel to the airport [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=444.54s)]
*  within 48 hours. And the military, placed on standby for President Biden, was able to secure [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  the airport and start the evacuation within 72 hours. The evacuation itself was an extraordinary [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=456.54s)]
*  effort under the most difficult conditions imaginable by our diplomats, by our military, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=463.66s)]
*  by our intelligence professionals. They worked around the clock to get American citizens, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=469.42s)]
*  Afghans who helped us, citizens of our allies and partners, and at-risk Afghans on planes out of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=474.70000000000005s)]
*  the country and off to the United States or to transit locations that our diplomats had arranged [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=480.94s)]
*  and negotiated in multiple countries. Our consular team worked 24-7 to reach out to Americans who [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=486.46s)]
*  could still be in the country, making in those couple of weeks 55,000 phone calls, sending [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  33,000 emails, and they're still at it. In the midst of this heroic effort, an ISIS-K attack [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=499.18s)]
*  killed 13 service members working the gates at H-Kaya, wounding 20 others, and killing and wounding [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=505.97999999999996s)]
*  scores of Afghans. These American service members gave their lives so that other lives could continue. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=512.14s)]
*  In the end, we completed one of the biggest airlifts in history, with 124,000 people evacuated [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=520.78s)]
*  to safety. And on August 31st in Kabul, the military mission in Afghanistan officially ended, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=527.58s)]
*  and a new diplomatic mission began. I want to acknowledge the more than two dozen countries [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=534.06s)]
*  that have helped with the relocation effort. Some served as transit hubs, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=540.86s)]
*  some welcoming Afghan evacuees for longer periods of time. And I want to recognize the extraordinary [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=544.78s)]
*  efforts by Congress as well. To name just a few examples, Congressman Smith-Patrick worked with [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=550.7s)]
*  the State Department to reunite an Afghan family in New Jersey. Congressman Keating worked with [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=556.38s)]
*  our folks on the ground to help a Voice of America reporter and his family get to the airport. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=562.22s)]
*  Congresswoman Jacobs and Congressman Nissa worked across party lines to draw attention [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=567.42s)]
*  to cases of legal permanent residence and Afghans at risk. Please know, your emails, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=573.5s)]
*  your calls made a real difference in getting people out, and we continue to use the lists [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=580.62s)]
*  and information you're providing in the next phase of the mission. Let me now just briefly outline [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=587.02s)]
*  what the State Department has done over the next of the last couple of weeks and where we're going [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=592.3s)]
*  in the days and weeks ahead. First, we moved our diplomatic operations from Kabul to Doha, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=597.18s)]
*  where our new Afghan Affairs Team is hard at work. Many of our key partners have joined us there. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=602.62s)]
*  Second, we're continuing our relentless efforts to help any remaining Americans, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=609.18s)]
*  as well as Afghans and citizens of allied and partner countries, leave Afghanistan if they so [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=614.06s)]
*  choose. This past Thursday, Qatar Airways charter flight with U.S. citizens and others [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=618.94s)]
*  on board departed Kabul and landed in Doha. On Friday, a second flight carrying U.S. citizens [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  and others departed Afghanistan. These flights were the result of a coordinated effort by the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=631.82s)]
*  United States, Qatar, and Turkey to reopen the airport and intense diplomacy to start the flights. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=637.2600000000001s)]
*  In addition to those flights, a half dozen American citizens, about a dozen permanent residents of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=644.38s)]
*  the United States, have also left Afghanistan via an overland route with our help. We're in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=649.82s)]
*  constant contact with American citizens still in Afghanistan who have told us that they wish to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=656.38s)]
*  leave. Each has been assigned a case management team to offer specific guidance and instruction. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=660.38s)]
*  Some declined to be on the first flights on Thursday and Friday for reasons including needing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=667.26s)]
*  more time to make arrangements, wanting to remain with extended family for now, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=671.42s)]
*  or medical issues that precluded traveling last week. We'll continue to help them and we'll [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=675.9s)]
*  continue to help any American who still wants to leave and Afghans to whom we have a special [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=680.86s)]
*  commitment. Just as we've done in other countries where we've evacuated our embassy, and hundreds [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=685.66s)]
*  or even thousands of Americans remain behind. For example, in Libya, in Syria, in Venezuela, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=691.9s)]
*  in Yemen, and Somalia. There is no deadline for this mission. Third, we're focused on [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=699.74s)]
*  counterterrorism. Taliban is committed to prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a base [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=707.34s)]
*  for external operations that could threaten the United States or our allies, including [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=712.7s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. We'll hold them accountable for that. That does not mean we will rely on them. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=716.78s)]
*  We will remain vigilant in monitoring threats. We'll maintain robust counterterrorism capabilities [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=723.82s)]
*  in the region to neutralize those threats if necessary. And we do that in places around the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=728.78s)]
*  world where we do not have military forces on the ground. Fourth, we continue our intensive diplomacy [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=733.98s)]
*  with allies and partners. We initiated a statement joined by more than half the world's countries, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  over 100 countries, as well as the United Nations Security Council resolution, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=747.3399999999999s)]
*  setting out the international community's expectations of a Taliban-led government. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=752.06s)]
*  We expect the Taliban to ensure freedom of travel, to make good on its commitments on [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=756.86s)]
*  counterterrorism, to uphold the basic rights of the Afghan people, including women, girls, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=761.5799999999999s)]
*  and minorities, to name a broadly representative permanent government, to force where reprisals. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=766.54s)]
*  The legitimacy and support the Taliban seeks from the international community [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=773.5799999999999s)]
*  will depend on its conduct. We've organized contact groups of key countries to ensure the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=778.14s)]
*  international community continues to speak with one voice on Afghanistan and to leverage our [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=784.14s)]
*  combined influence. Last week, I led a ministerial meeting of 22 countries, NATO, the EU, the United [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=788.6199999999999s)]
*  Nations, to continue to align our efforts. And fifth, we'll continue to support humanitarian aid [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=795.26s)]
*  to the Afghan people. Consistent with sanctions, this aid will not flow through the government, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=802.06s)]
*  but rather through independent organizations like NGOs and UN agencies. Just today, we announced [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=807.3399999999999s)]
*  that the United States is providing nearly $64 million in new humanitarian assistance to the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=813.02s)]
*  people of Afghanistan to meet critical health and nutrition needs, address the protection concerns [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=817.98s)]
*  of women, children, and minorities, to help more children, including girls, go back to school. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=823.66s)]
*  This additional funding means the United States has provided nearly $330 million [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=829.34s)]
*  in assistance to the Afghan people this fiscal year. In Doha and Ramstein, I toured the facilities [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=833.5s)]
*  where Afghans that we evacuated are being processed before moving on to their next destinations. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=840.62s)]
*  Here at home, I spent some time at the Dulles Expo Center, where more than 45,000 Afghans have [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=846.14s)]
*  been processed after arriving in the United States. It's remarkable, remarkable to see what [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=852.22s)]
*  our diplomats, our military, and employees from other civilian agencies across the U.S. government [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=858.22s)]
*  have been able to achieve in a very short time. They've met an enormous human need. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=863.34s)]
*  They've coordinated food, water, sanitation for thousands, tens of thousands of people. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=868.38s)]
*  They're arranging medical care, including the delivery of babies, the reuniting families who [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=874.22s)]
*  are separated and caring for unaccompanied minors. It's an extraordinary interagency effort [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=879.02s)]
*  and a powerful testament to the skill, the compassion, and the dedication of our people. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=885.26s)]
*  We should all be proud of what they're doing. And as we've done throughout our history, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=891.34s)]
*  Americans are now welcoming families from Afghanistan into our communities [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=896.38s)]
*  and helping them resettle as they start their new lives. That's something to be proud of as well. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca6HwNQQLZ8&t=900.54s)]
