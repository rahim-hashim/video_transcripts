# Rep. Kinzinger Says 'The Endless War Just Got Fired Up Again'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU)
*  Joining me now, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who served on an Air Force pilot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=0.0s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan, a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=4.36s)]
*  Well, first, what's your reaction to these explosions at the airport and what this does [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=8.28s)]
*  to our attempt to get Americans safely out? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  And the report that there are Marines injured. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look, I could have listened to General McMaster for another hour. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=17.72s)]
*  He is spot on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, first, the humanitarian side of this, it's awful. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=26.32s)]
*  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the military members and, of course, the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=30.6s)]
*  families of those outside of the gate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=35.76s)]
*  But this was entirely foreseen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=39.36s)]
*  In fact, a couple of days ago, we had a briefing by the administration in which they laid out [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=40.96s)]
*  the specific credible threat that this was. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=46.04s)]
*  I have never actually personally had an administration lay out that threat in such specificity, so [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=48.32s)]
*  they knew this was coming. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=55.28s)]
*  And the question is for kind of the Rand Paul endless war crowd that have been stoking this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=57.36s)]
*  fire of endless war and it's time for America. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=62.2s)]
*  Man, we're all tired. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=64.84s)]
*  When your grandma tells you how tired you are and you eventually feel tired is, congratulations, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=66.72s)]
*  the endless war just got fired up again. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=72.36s)]
*  Because if ISIS and al-Qaeda's job was just simply to get us out of Afghanistan and then [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  we can all live in our respective corners peacefully, you know there would not have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=79.2s)]
*  been a suicide attack a couple days prior to the U.S. leaving. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=82.84s)]
*  So I fear that as terrible as this is, right now the decision we make is going to be very [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=87.0s)]
*  much determining the future of terrorism, not just in the region but in this world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=93.56s)]
*  What should the decision be? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=99.64s)]
*  Well, I think as the general said prior, what is our goal? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=101.4s)]
*  I think first off, in the very least, our goal should be to get every American out and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=106.64s)]
*  every Afghan that helped us out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=111.8s)]
*  I think if we fail to do that, if we fall short of that, not just will the retreat from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=114.92s)]
*  Afghanistan had been a massive mistake, that's going to be, by the way, a huge recruiting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=120.2s)]
*  tool for jihadism and future groups like that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=124.56s)]
*  ISIS now can go and say, look, we finally, it took a lot, we've taken some damage, we've [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=128.8s)]
*  gotten hits, we lost territory. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=132.56s)]
*  But as you know, we were promised we are now coming back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=134.84s)]
*  I think if we leave today and we stop the evacuation, short of at least falling through [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=139.16s)]
*  that basic thing, this is going to be the most emboldening thing for the terrorists [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  and the most embarrassing moment for the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=148.36s)]
*  Now look, is that going to be dangerous? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=153.12s)]
*  Is that going to put us at risk? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=154.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=156.12s)]
*  What I personally would like to see, Andrea, is the United States take back the airport [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=157.12s)]
*  we never should have abandoned in Bagram and stay there until we get every American and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  every Afghan out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=165.68s)]
*  Of course, if I had my way, I would keep a residual force, I would have kept a residual [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=167.12s)]
*  force in Afghanistan and prevented the kind of hell from spreading that we're seeing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=171.36s)]
*  happen today. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me follow up on that because Lindsey Graham said something similar today about [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  taking back Bagram. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=183.0s)]
*  Bagram was not only abandoned but broken down, equipment was taken out, it was unwired, the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  power supplies taken out, Taliban's taken it over, the prison was released there, the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=189.52s)]
*  opened and the prison door is released with the worst of the worst, Al Qaeda and other [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=195.32s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=200.24s)]
*  How do you take, and it's 45 miles from Kabul, how do you take Bagram back without a major [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=201.24s)]
*  deployment? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=209.24s)]
*  Well, I think keep in mind, yeah, the 25 miles from Kabul issue, keep in mind, you know, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=210.24s)]
*  we've got basically Americans and SIVs all through Afghanistan, so air can shorten that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=215.68s)]
*  distance pretty quickly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=220.4s)]
*  Obviously, there can be U.S. forces to do it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  There's also a pretty significant resistance that still exists, what used to be the Northern [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=226.6s)]
*  Alliance. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  I guess they're calling themselves the Northern Alliance again, but it is actually made up [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  of those old tribes, but also Afghan National Army that didn't just abandon the fight and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  decide to fight on their side of resistance, a much more moderate group of those that we [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=242.36s)]
*  supported again after 9-11. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=247.52s)]
*  I think that's what you're going to have to do, is take that area back and then make the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=250.28s)]
*  determination that we'll be here as long as it takes to get everybody out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=254.76s)]
*  Now, look, I recognize the difficulty of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=258.0s)]
*  And the question is for Americans is, do we want to take the impact of this, see this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=261.16s)]
*  growing threat continue to thrive, or are we willing to do tough things? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=266.78s)]
*  And I got to tell you, no matter what we choose on Bagram or anything else, the fact that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=271.44s)]
*  we were, you know, sitting there going, man, we can't keep 2,500 troops there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=275.68s)]
*  Donald Trump was standing in front of, in front of everybody telling him how the war [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=279.68s)]
*  wasn't worth it, as he's trying to negotiate a solution for goodness sakes and negotiate [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=282.6s)]
*  with the Taliban. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=286.64s)]
*  This is going to be forced to our doorstep again, and we're going to have to make these [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=289.6s)]
*  decisions anyway. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, near term, short of taking, short of reinserting thousands of troops, which is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  what it would require to take Bagram back, what to do about August 31st? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=299.04s)]
*  Would you extend the deadline until we find those thousand Americans and make sure that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=304.08s)]
*  they want to leave, get them out? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=309.4s)]
*  What about the remaining S.I.V.s? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=311.4s)]
*  What about Afghans at risk? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=313.08s)]
*  Where would you, where would you draw the line? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=314.32s)]
*  Would you, would you extend it further? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=315.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, I would if I needed to. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=317.68s)]
*  Look, here's the thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=320.44s)]
*  And first off, the insertion of thousands of troops, we have five, six thousand troops [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=321.44s)]
*  right now in Kabul that we had to insert because of, because of this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=324.92s)]
*  Look, here's the thing is we have to determine, do we want to follow through on our word or [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=329.32s)]
*  not? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  Where did the August 31st deadline come from? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, President Biden has said, look, you know, Donald Trump gave me a May 1st deadline [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  and I extended that and I said, we're going to get out now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=341.44s)]
*  He actually initially said September 11th. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  And then they realized the PR disaster of that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=347.32s)]
*  So arbitrarily backed it up to we're going to be out of country by August 31st. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  This was not a negotiated deadline. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=353.48s)]
*  This is not something that's on paper with the Taliban. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=355.88s)]
*  That date is May 1st. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  So why we're sticking to August 31st? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=360.1s)]
*  I want to get this done as quickly as possible, but we cannot leave a single American that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=362.52s)]
*  wants to leave in Afghanistan. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=367.4s)]
*  And I would say there's going to you're going to see an immense amount of videos. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  It's going to put tears in our eyes if we see these Afghan SIFs that were promised to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  come to the United States end up being on the receiving end of the Taliban after the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=378.12s)]
*  United States leave. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  So I would extend as long as necessary, but we'll see what happens. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Adam Kinsinger from Illinois, thank you very much. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_v-272EYIU&t=392.36s)]
