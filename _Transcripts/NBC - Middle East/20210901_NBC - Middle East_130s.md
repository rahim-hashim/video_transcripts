# Gen. Milley: Future Coordination With The Taliban Is ‘Possible’
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA)
*  Ms. Courtney, you know this building so well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=0.0s)]
*  You've covered it for decades now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=2.24s)]
*  That was an interesting posture the two of them took. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's so much different than what we saw [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=8.16s)]
*  from the president yesterday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  And you tell me that felt like two leaders who [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=12.52s)]
*  were worried about their rank and file getting demoralized, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=16.68s)]
*  worried about their rank and file starting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=23.16s)]
*  to get maybe politicized. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=25.88s)]
*  Am I reading too much into their tone? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=29.28s)]
*  I absolutely agree, Chuck. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  I was struck by the fact that both of them, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=33.28s)]
*  in their opening comments and then in the question and answer [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=35.24s)]
*  period, both of them talked about how these have been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=38.2s)]
*  very difficult and emotional days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  Of course, both men served in Afghanistan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=42.68s)]
*  And then Secretary Austin, as General Austin, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=44.8s)]
*  was the head of US Central Command, the overall commander [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=47.24s)]
*  of that entire region. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  So they have a personal tie or personal ties [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=51.32s)]
*  to the war in Afghanistan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=54.08s)]
*  But there's a very real concern right now [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  about the men and women who've served in Afghanistan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=57.76s)]
*  because of the tumultuous last couple of weeks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=61.28s)]
*  Not just the pictures that we saw [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=64.32s)]
*  of Afghans trying to get out of the country in the last days [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=66.72s)]
*  of this evacuation mission, but the fact [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  that 13 men and women were killed in that attack [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=71.64s)]
*  last week, this has been an emotional time for people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=75.28s)]
*  who have dedicated lives and blood and treasure [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=78.12s)]
*  to the war in Afghanistan. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=80.88s)]
*  And we heard that from both of them here today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=82.16s)]
*  But also, I was struck by the talk [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=84.44s)]
*  about the potential for the US to work with the Taliban, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=86.44s)]
*  specifically by something that General Milley said. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  He said that in war, you do what you must, not necessarily [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=92.56s)]
*  what you want to do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=96.48s)]
*  That is very telling here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=97.64s)]
*  And it's consistent with what I've been hearing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=99.4s)]
*  from defense officials. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=101.8s)]
*  There is a real sense of skepticism [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=103.2s)]
*  that this is a new and improved Taliban. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  This is a brutal enemy that the United States has fought [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=109.0s)]
*  for two decades in Afghanistan, despite the fact [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=111.56s)]
*  there was a very narrow window here [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=114.32s)]
*  where they worked with the US. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=115.8s)]
*  They helped the US on the ground there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=116.84s)]
*  I don't see a lot of people here who [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=118.88s)]
*  think that there's going to be some enduring relationship [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=121.6s)]
*  with the Taliban, even though they have this common enemy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  in ISIS-K in Afghanistan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=127.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKbuAwiSMA&t=128.84s)]
