# Panetta: ‘Work In Afghanistan Is Not Finished’
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk)
*  All right. Let's talk about the near term here. We're going to get a real test of President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden's theory that you can basically deal with terrorist outposts in Afghanistan sort [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=5.04s)]
*  of over the horizon and I guess similar to what we've been doing in Syria and in parts [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=12.24s)]
*  of Africa. How logistically possible is that with Afghanistan? With Syria and in Africa, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=18.72s)]
*  we've got plenty of staging areas that can get you within close proximity. Can you say [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=24.72s)]
*  the same for Afghanistan? Look, the bottom line is this. We can leave a battlefield of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=31.2s)]
*  the war on terrorism, but frankly we cannot leave the war on terrorism. We still face [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=40.96s)]
*  terrorists around the world, whether it's Al-Qaeda, whether it's ISIS, whether it's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Boko Haram, whether it's Al-Shabaab, and we're going to have to deal with them, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=52.0s)]
*  hopefully with using counterterrorism operations. And the same thing, frankly, is true for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=57.76s)]
*  Afghanistan. We can't just say to hell with Afghanistan at this point because the fact is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=62.88s)]
*  the president yesterday said we have to go after ISIS. We have to go after those who are involved [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=70.56s)]
*  in this attack. That's going to require counterterrorism operations to go after them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=75.92s)]
*  The same thing is going to be true with Al-Qaeda. I think the likelihood is that Al-Qaeda will [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=80.96s)]
*  reestablish itself with the Taliban, and we're going to have to go after Al-Qaeda. So the work [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=85.6s)]
*  in Afghanistan is not finished. We are going to have to find ways to go after terrorists wherever [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=92.08s)]
*  they are. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=98.0s)]
*  . [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZHDzc86uk&t=110.88s)]
