# 'Stunned, angry, and infuriated': Journalists address US silence on colleagues killed in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg)
*  On a crowded sidewalk in southern Gaza, a group of mourners congregated for a makeshift funeral service. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=0.0s)]
*  They wailed and they prayed over a body draped in a white burial shroud covered with a blue press jacket. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=6.0s)]
*  Another journalist killed while covering the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=12.0s)]
*  This man wearing his own navy blue press jacket embracing a crying woman is Wael Al-Dudado. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=16.0s)]
*  He's Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=23.0s)]
*  He's holding back tears of his own because the person there all morning is his 27-year-old son, Hamza Al-Dudado. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=25.0s)]
*  Like his father, Hamza was an Al Jazeera journalist. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=32.0s)]
*  Hamza was killed alongside a colleague, Mustafa Turaya, in an Israeli airstrike that hit their car in the southern city of Rafah on the Egyptian border a week ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=36.0s)]
*  Now at first, the Israeli Defense Forces confirmed carrying out the strike, saying that it had targeted a terrorist vehicle. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=45.0s)]
*  An IDF statement said in part, we're aware of reports that during the strikes, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorists were also hit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=52.0s)]
*  NBC News asked if the IDF had evidence to support its allegation that an individual in the vehicle was a terrorist, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=61.0s)]
*  and the spokesperson said the incident was quote, unfortunate and that an investigation was ongoing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=67.0s)]
*  But on Wednesday night, the IDF put out another statement saying it targeted that vehicle because the individuals inside were operating a quote, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=73.0s)]
*  hostile drone near Rafah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=81.0s)]
*  The IDF also went on to claim that Al-Dudado and Turaya were members of Gaza-based terrorist organizations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=84.0s)]
*  Both of their families have rejected these claims by Israel, calling them fabricated and false. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=91.0s)]
*  Al Jazeera also condemned these new claims, calling them quote, false and misleading attempts to justify the killings of our colleagues. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=95.0s)]
*  After joining the mourners distraught over the death of his son, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=103.0s)]
*  YL Al-Dudado vowed to keep working, demonstrating the defiant perseverance that he has displayed since the beginning of this war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=106.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, personal loss and tragedy has followed YL through this bloody conflict. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=113.0s)]
*  In October, YL was reporting live on Al Jazeera when he learned that his wife, his 15-year-old son, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=119.0s)]
*  his seven-year-old daughter and his grandson had all been killed in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=126.0s)]
*  This is the moment YL learned the news. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=132.0s)]
*  He's being escorted by fellow journalists through the hospital in Gaza to see his family in that very hospital's morgue. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=135.0s)]
*  Stunning many viewers, YL returned to the airwaves the next day. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=142.0s)]
*  He said quote, I knew that despite the pain and the bleeding wounds, I would return fast to meet you through the camera's lens, end quote. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=145.0s)]
*  In December, YL's friend and cameraman was killed in a drone strike as the pair were covering the aftermath of another attack. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=152.0s)]
*  YL sustained injuries in that attack as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=159.0s)]
*  My colleague, Eamon Moheddin, knows why YL did well from his time reporting in Gaza. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=162.0s)]
*  Eamon spoke to his friend last night about the sacrifices that his family made so that he could keep reporting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=167.0s)]
*  It was YL's first TV interview with Western media. It's been translated into English. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=172.0s)]
*  So when the time comes and their blood sheds and their lives are sacrificed, I should leave them and give up this job? Never. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=177.0s)]
*  It was incumbent on me to be faithful to the blood of my wife, the partner of my life, and my son, who had to play the role of father and an older brother, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=186.0s)]
*  and my son Mahmoud, who was attending an American school and preparing to be a journalist who speaks English, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=195.0s)]
*  and Sham, who was the apple of my eye, the flower of my household. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=201.0s)]
*  She entered school and my grandson, who was not more than six months and 14 members of my family, my cousins who died at the same time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=205.0s)]
*  All of this made it incumbent on me to be faithful to them when their blood was dead because they made the sacrifice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=213.0s)]
*  Maybe for all these reasons I can continue. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=219.0s)]
*  A record number of journalists have died in this conflict, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=222.0s)]
*  Quote, more journalists have been killed in the first 10 weeks of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year, according to CPJ. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=227.0s)]
*  As of yesterday, at least 82 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war began on October 7th. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=238.0s)]
*  That's according to CPJ as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=244.0s)]
*  Seventy-five were Palestinian, four were Israeli, three were Lebanese. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=246.0s)]
*  The work of journalists like Wael Al-Dadu, like his son Hamza Dadu, like their colleague Mustafa Tureya, is critical. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=250.0s)]
*  Most mainstream American news outlets do not have access to Gaza, and for those that do, that access is not free of Israeli censorship and control. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=257.0s)]
*  So we must rely on the voices of these Palestinian journalists to be loud enough for the world to hear. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=265.0s)]
*  The world must witness what they witness. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=270.0s)]
*  Joining me now are two of the smartest and bravest journalists I know. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=274.0s)]
*  Terrell Jermain-Star is an independent journalist and the founder of the Black Diplomats official YouTube channel and Black Diplomats substack newsletter. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=276.0s)]
*  Karen Attia is an award-winning columnist for the Washington Post. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=284.0s)]
*  Karen was also Jamal Khashoggi's editor at the Washington Post until he was killed by agents of the Saudi government at the consulate in Istanbul. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=287.0s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=296.0s)]
*  Karen, you and Terrell and others have been pointing out to us for some time that for some reason the world's quieter about this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=298.0s)]
*  Journalists themselves in many cases are quieter about the deaths of our colleagues in Palestine, in Gaza, than we perhaps otherwise would be. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=308.0s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=319.0s)]
*  As you mentioned in your intro with me, I was thrust into being on the forefront of defending supposedly our Western values of press freedom and journalism when Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=323.0s)]
*  And I remember how there was vigils and an outpouring of grief and anger over Jamal's killing and a vow for us to particularly to protect Arab journalists. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=341.0s)]
*  Right. And now here we are some almost five years later since then. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=356.0s)]
*  And as you said in your introduction, nearly 100 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=361.0s)]
*  And I've been frankly stunned, angry and infuriated by the lack of solidarity, the lack of outrage, the lack of calling on our leaders, on Israel to do more to protect journalists. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=370.0s)]
*  And so it really just underscores a hypocrisy that it's difficult for me to look away from. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=388.0s)]
*  Terrell, you know, these journalists in many cases, their job is harder. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=397.0s)]
*  When you work in a country like when you're in a place like Gaza or in some of these countries, it's harder to do than it is our job. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=402.0s)]
*  These people have to in many cases wear their flak jackets every day. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=409.0s)]
*  They're under threat not just from their own government, but other governments. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=412.0s)]
*  There is a sense with these journalists who have died in Gaza or in this conflict that some of them had it coming. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=415.0s)]
*  They, you know, it's not the same as being a journalist elsewhere. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=424.0s)]
*  They're not entitled to the same protections and safeties that perhaps I would if I were reporting there. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=427.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And I can tell you this as somebody who's covered the war in Ukraine since it started is that ultimately it's easy to create narratives about who is good versus bad. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=432.0s)]
*  When I was in Ukraine, it was very easy to say Russia bad and then the Ukrainians good. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=441.0s)]
*  Now it's true. Now the problem comes in when it goes to another region where you have Palestinians, for example. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=445.0s)]
*  And so the way that they're covered is that they're the only people who are allowed to give us voice into what's going on. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=451.0s)]
*  But just like black people here in the United States, often our expertise are not really is not really acknowledged. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=456.0s)]
*  Our voices are not acknowledged until white people confirm that it's true or not. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=461.0s)]
*  And so the difference there is that we've had decades upon decades of Israeli propaganda that makes us forget about the fact that the creation of Israel came at the expense of 700000 Palestinians. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=466.0s)]
*  And the challenge with that is as journalists, the courage that we need in order to bring humanity to these people, because what often happens is that they either with Palestinians, they either deserve it or they had it come in. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=478.0s)]
*  And there's really have not been an inflection point in the United States. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=492.0s)]
*  Me and Karen were talking about this in our earlier conversation of blood. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=496.0s)]
*  And keep in mind that in this country, that inflection point with our blood came full circle with the Mike Browns of the world, came with the Eric Garner's, came with the George Floyd's. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=501.0s)]
*  And so it made people kind of care. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=511.0s)]
*  But we've had decades of wars in the Middle East, colonialism that just made us just made the American public feel like, OK, maybe that's just the way it operates in that part of the world. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=513.0s)]
*  And journalists play a role in that in ways that they don't care to admit. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=523.0s)]
*  And why? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=526.0s)]
*  God, God bless his family. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=527.0s)]
*  Could you imagine if a journalist from the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC, MSNBC lost their entire family, how the world will react to that? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=529.0s)]
*  But because they're Palestinians, because they're brown people, no one cares because ultimately that's the way it goes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=537.0s)]
*  And journalists who are not calling out the hypocrisy are apart and complicit in the narrative. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=544.0s)]
*  And Karen, there are others who say perhaps more sympathetically that just a bad environment to be a journalist is tough. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=551.0s)]
*  If you're a journalist in your journalist in Gaza, you know, bad things are going to happen to you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=557.0s)]
*  We sort of need to live in a world where, you know, go back to a world where we thought protecting journalists was a priority. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=562.0s)]
*  That's one of the things that cannot be had from the IDF about whether or not they can attempt to preserve the lives of journalists in Gaza. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=567.0s)]
*  They're sort of saying if you're in if you're in the way of the stuff we're doing, you're going to go down. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=576.0s)]
*  None of that stopped us from expressing so much solidarity and support to journalists in Ukraine who were documenting and filming and risking their lives very bravely to document what was happening with the Russian invasion. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=583.0s)]
*  None of difficult environments. Yes, difficult environments, but that still does not excuse, I think, the almost the victim blaming element of this. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=599.0s)]
*  And again, you don't have to kill a journalist in order to silence them. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=611.0s)]
*  And that's, of course, the ultimate silencing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=617.0s)]
*  But that doesn't include capturing also journalists who have positive journalists who have said that they have decided to stop their coverage because they have to also focus on the fact that they are human and they are also just trying to survive. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=620.0s)]
*  They're trying to survive starvation. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=635.0s)]
*  They're trying to survive disease. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=637.0s)]
*  And again, we see this, we see this, CPJ has noted in its report allegations of not just journalists being targeted, but allegations that their entire families are being targeted. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=640.0s)]
*  So imagine the impossible choice of deciding whether or not to bear witness to your own group's almost systematic decimation and whether or not you want to live, whether or not your father, mother, children, neighbors, whether or not it's worth it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=651.0s)]
*  While Abdul-Babd has made this choice, and I believe he is the best of what our profession has to offer and is a thousand times more brave than a lot of people sitting in their offices, air conditioned and safe, you know, here in the U.S. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=670.0s)]
*  So I think it's really important that those of us who are in this profession keep calling this out. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=687.0s)]
*  We know that there are other challenges. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=694.0s)]
*  It is very difficult to get personal protective equipment in to help these journalists. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=697.0s)]
*  And at the same time, when your house is being struck by a missile, there's only so much that one could do. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=702.0s)]
*  So, again, I mean, this goes back to this didn't just happen today in terms of the killings of journalists, Palestinian journalists in Gaza. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=711.0s)]
*  We have to also remember Shirin Abu Akhlai, who was killed as well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=720.0s)]
*  Also, a legendary Al Jazeera journalist, Palestinian American, who there still has not been any accountability for her death. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=726.0s)]
*  So to take this all in totality, we cannot separate the deaths and the frankly the callous indifference to the deaths of Palestinian journalists to the callous indifference against the Palestinian people that we see so tragically in the West. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=734.0s)]
*  I want to put up a document from the Committee to Protect Journalists about the journalists who have been killed around the world in various other conflicts. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=753.0s)]
*  Going back to 2006, there were a lot of people killed in Iraq, 56 in Iraq, 35 in the Philippines, 32 in Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan, Ukraine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=761.0s)]
*  Look at Israel and Gaza, 82. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=771.0s)]
*  Karen just made a really, really important point. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=773.0s)]
*  These journalists, we go to events to award them every year, they are bearing witness. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=776.0s)]
*  Without bearing witness, you cannot hold anybody to account. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=782.0s)]
*  If you can't tell people what's going on, there's no second part to the story. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=784.0s)]
*  When you silence people, whether it's through killing them or through the idea that they're going to die in the coverage of this stuff, it does have the effect of weaning, of having parents tell their kids don't become journalists. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=788.0s)]
*  Or parents with young journalists saying, you do the same thing, you go into dangerous places, but when they kill journalists, you're going to have more people telling you, Terrell, don't do this one, this one's too risky. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=798.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Listen, I was almost killed multiple times when I was in Ukraine. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=807.0s)]
*  Literally, I was almost killed by a Russian airstrike. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=812.0s)]
*  Four of the soldiers I was with during that strike were killed in this carnage. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=814.0s)]
*  It's not an easy job to do at all, mind you, with 15 to maybe 25 pounds of protective gear on you. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=819.0s)]
*  And so one of the reasons why my work resonated with so many people was that the passion and the humanity that I brought to the Ukrainian people as they were experiencing it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=826.0s)]
*  And so I think that the contradiction that I see is that in Palestine, there aren't people who are like me when I was in Ukraine, worked without a government censor. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=836.0s)]
*  No one was telling me what to do or what to say. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=847.0s)]
*  But in Gaza, it's a vastly different experience. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=850.0s)]
*  And so people could trust my voice about what was going on there. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=854.0s)]
*  But the problem in Palestine, the problem with the Palestinians, which has always been the case with people of color, journalists around the world, is that they are the only people who could talk about their humanity. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=857.0s)]
*  And so the wider mainstream media complex is saying, we do not believe you. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=868.0s)]
*  You are not telling the truth. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=874.0s)]
*  Right. Nothing that they say, nothing that they do is good enough. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=876.0s)]
*  And so when I see these people raise their dead children before cameras, I have so much, it's gut wrenching because I've also been to Palestine myself. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=878.0s)]
*  And I honestly look at them and I just I pray for them. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=888.0s)]
*  And I just look at them and say, you know what? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=893.0s)]
*  No matter how much you try, there's just a larger media network that's not going to look at your baby and that in those dead children, the way they look at the children and the people who I was helping. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=896.0s)]
*  And you can't. And until we deal with the racial dynamic of that's what's in play here, it's not going to change. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyE4Bpsq1xg&t=907.0s)]
