# Trump says U.S. should ‘level’ Gaza, create ‘Riviera of the Middle East’
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs)
*  Good evening from Seattle. I'm Chris Hayes. Last hour, Donald Trump wrapped up a lengthy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=0.0s)]
*  joint appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And over the course of a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=4.96s)]
*  rambling, often incoherent hour, the president of the United States appeared to announce [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=10.32s)]
*  a completely unprecedented American policy towards Gaza and the people that live there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=16.88s)]
*  that on its face would both violate international law and be seen by millions, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=23.28s)]
*  maybe hundreds of millions or billions around the world as the U.S. backing explicit ethnic [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=27.92s)]
*  cleansing. The announcement has enormous implications for the region, for Palestinians [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=33.6s)]
*  in Gaza, for U.S. service members who apparently are going to be pressed into service for this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  project. President Trump announcing the U.S. would, in his words, own, that's the word he used, own [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=44.88s)]
*  Gaza, that it would transfer the population of the 1.8 million Palestinians who live there amidst [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  the rubble and the damage those who have survived the last year and a half, that they would be [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  transferred out of Gaza into what he speculated could be as many as a dozen other countries that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=65.84s)]
*  will apparently take them in. He said the U.S. would possibly send American troops to Gaza [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=71.44s)]
*  and develop the region into quote the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=79.2s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We'll own it, level it out, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=85.28s)]
*  create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=92.0s)]
*  the people of the area, do a real job, do something different, just can't go back. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  You are talking tonight about the United States taking over a sovereign territory. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=104.32s)]
*  What authority would allow you to do that? Are you talking about a permanent occupation there? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=109.27999999999999s)]
*  Redevelopment? I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=114.88s)]
*  that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East and everybody I've spoken to, this was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  not a decision made lightly, everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=128.32s)]
*  owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=133.76s)]
*  magnificent in a really magnificent area. We have an opportunity to do something that could be [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=139.2s)]
*  phenomenal and I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=145.76s)]
*  Middle East, this could be something that could be so magnificent. Now it's a little unclear whether [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=151.28s)]
*  this was an announcement of a new policy, although it seemed to be something he deliberated on, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=160.16s)]
*  the commander in chief, or it was just Donald Trump riffing off the cuff, but again, he said all this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=164.88s)]
*  onstage with Benjamin Netanyahu after the two men had met in the Oval Office, so it seemed to be [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=169.76s)]
*  a formal policy announcement. The President of the United States saying that we need to try something [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=174.96s)]
*  new in the Middle East and apparently something new means the American occupation and forced [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=180.96s)]
*  depopulation and expulsion of sovereign territory currently inhabited by 1.8 million people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=188.4s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen is a Democrat of Maryland, he sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  he's been very outspoken about U.S. policy in the Middle East, he joins me now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=202.32s)]
*  Senator, I guess I just first, this appears to be an actual announcement of current U.S. policy that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  we will own Gaza, that we will go in, and that U.S. troops might be sent. Your reaction? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=212.56s)]
*  So Chris, I think we need to reiterate what the President of the United States just said, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  and you said it, but it bears repeating. He just said that it will be United States policy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=226.8s)]
*  to forcibly displace 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. That is ethnic cleansing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  by another name. He said the United States would then own the Gaza Strip and that we would develop [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=240.72s)]
*  the Gaza Strip and that other countries would take these Palestinians. He says, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=247.44s)]
*  he's talked to a lot of people and they think it's a great idea. Well, we know that just a few weeks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=253.92s)]
*  ago the Arab countries, the Arab countries had an emergency meeting and responded forcefully [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=260.24s)]
*  against this idea and said it was unacceptable. So what the President is doing here is really [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=267.12s)]
*  throwing a match on an already very volatile region. This is something that Iran and our [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=272.56s)]
*  adversaries will celebrate. The super far right wing in Israel will celebrate. In fact, Ben Gavir, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=280.24s)]
*  one of the farthest right members, has already tweeted out his support for the President's idea. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=287.2s)]
*  So this is a very volatile mix in addition to being despicable in so many ways. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=294.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few dimensions here, it's worth, and if I sound a little stunned, it's because I [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=303.6s)]
*  really am. You know, the forcible expulsion of 2 million people is an atrocity. That's the kind [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=308.48s)]
*  of thing that if any other nation state does it, we view it as an atrocity. You can't forcibly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=315.68s)]
*  expel people. I'm not even clear, I mean, it's obviously violation of international law. I'm [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=323.6s)]
*  not even clear that he has American legal authority to do something like this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=329.92s)]
*  Well, certainly he doesn't have the legal authority to deploy American forces, right, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  to push 2 million people out of Gaza. That would require congressional authorization. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=342.56s)]
*  He also, of course, ran on being the president who was going to stop all wars, not get us in the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=351.84s)]
*  middle of more conflicts. So this is why it is such a jaw dropping moment for the American people [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=358.08s)]
*  and the country, for the President of the United States to say, as you say, I mean, this isn't just [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=368.08s)]
*  like a paper violation of international law. It is ethnic cleansing by another name, and it will [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=372.4s)]
*  certainly embolden our adversaries, and it is really going to worry, is a soft word. It's going [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  to scare our friends, and this is a moment, Chris, for the Arab countries to tell President Trump [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=387.28s)]
*  that they meant what they said, that they opposed this idea, and that they believe that the only way [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=394.0s)]
*  to secure long-term peace and stability and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians alike [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=400.24s)]
*  is through self-determination for both peoples and a two-state solution. That's what they've been [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=406.8s)]
*  saying. This is really going to be a moment to look carefully at how they respond. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=411.6s)]
*  There's a moral dimension, there's a strategic and legal dimension, but there's also a security [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=419.68s)]
*  dimension here, and you alluded to it, but I think it's worth spending some time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=423.68s)]
*  The U.S. has tens of thousands of service members deployed in the Middle East. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=427.04s)]
*  The President of the United States has just announced to the world that they are soon to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=431.44s)]
*  be used for a project of ethnic cleansing in the most volatile, sensitive region in the world, and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=435.52s)]
*  I can't help but feel like has essentially painted a target on the back of every service member [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=441.92s)]
*  in the region. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=449.44s)]
*  Well, that's exactly what he's done, because this is the most sort of volatile, toxic mix of ideas [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=450.16s)]
*  that you could bring together at this particular moment, and so it will be a moment of great danger [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=461.92s)]
*  for Americans, whether there are servicemen in the region, there are embassy personnel in the region. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=476.88s)]
*  No, it is such an irresponsible and reckless act by the President of the United States, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  and like you, I found myself just stunned. He'd been making comments kind of like this, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=483.92s)]
*  leading up to this moment, but to really announce it as U.S. policy, he also said, and we should be [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  very alert for what's happening next, he said within the next two weeks, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=498.72s)]
*  he's going to make some decisions regarding the West Bank, and who knows what he's thinking about there. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  You're a U.S. Senator, and obviously you're in the minority. That means that you can't control [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=514.4s)]
*  what happens in the U.S. Senate, but there is a lot of things that U.S. Senators can do. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=519.04s)]
*  Because of unanimous consent and because of the way the Senate functions, there's a kind of tacit [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  set of norms that you all have to come to agreement on in order to have the place run. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=530.64s)]
*  As a Senator, I know you and your colleagues like to see it doing work. At what point does it become [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=535.12s)]
*  important to use every procedural means to essentially bring the body to a halt until [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=542.96s)]
*  this policy and what's happening with Elon Musk and USAID and what seems to be a raft of flagrantly [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=550.4s)]
*  illegal actions are stopped or curtailed? Well, I think that moment is now. I think that moment [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=557.36s)]
*  is now. And look, a group of us were outside the Department of Treasury today essentially saying [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=564.72s)]
*  we cannot have business as usual. We're not going to let Elon Musk take over the government of the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=572.0s)]
*  United States and take these illegal actions to stop federal funds from going to our communities, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=577.12s)]
*  from trying to replace merit-based civil servants with political cronies, take over the payment [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=583.28s)]
*  system and get access to people's Social Security numbers. So that is now, which is why Senator [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=589.76s)]
*  Schatz and I and others have said in response to the AID action that we're going to shut down any [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  nominations with respect to Trump appointees in the foreign policy sphere. But I think we need to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=604.24s)]
*  go more broadly. I've been a very clear advocate for no business as usual given all of what's [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=610.8s)]
*  happening around our country. I mean, the President of the United States just announced the U.S. is [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  going to back ethnic cleansing of 2 million people. I just, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  thank you for making time tonight. I really do appreciate it. Chris, thank you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=629.8399999999999s)]
