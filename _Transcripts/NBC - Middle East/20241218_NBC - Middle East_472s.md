# What happened in Syria? Senators 'don't trust' Tulsi Gabbard: Jolly
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY)
*  NBC's Ali Vitale is reporting from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us on set, former Republican congressman of Florida, David Jolly, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=2.9s)]
*  and MSNBC political analyst, and Michael Hardaway, former communications director [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=6.32s)]
*  and spokesman for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, former staffer for Senator Dick Durbin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=10.58s)]
*  Okay, Ali, what kind of support are you hearing or lack thereof for RFK Jr. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=15.68s)]
*  in his meetings with senators this week? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=20.98s)]
*  Well, Senator Dick Durbin is right to lay out the stakes that way, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=22.64s)]
*  especially when you're talking about the skepticism and outright concern [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=26.16s)]
*  that we have heard from senators on both sides of the aisle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=29.8s)]
*  when it comes to RFK Jr.'s prior statements and work around vaccines [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=32.44s)]
*  and delegitimizing vaccines that have worked to help people and saved lives [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=37.4s)]
*  over the last decades, specifically when you talk about the polio vaccine [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=42.16s)]
*  and comments that RFK Jr.'s lawyer and ally has made about that vaccine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=46.72s)]
*  That's something that senators on the Republican side of the aisle, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=52.28s)]
*  including Senator Kennedy, who you were just talking about with Julie, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=54.96s)]
*  said that they had concerns about. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=58.2s)]
*  We heard from Senator Mitch McConnell, himself a survivor of childhood polio, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=60.0s)]
*  talking about the efficacy of that vaccine and the need to not delegitimize [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=64.76s)]
*  things that help people live and have made people's lives better. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=70.12s)]
*  That's just one of the issues, though, when you talk about RFK Jr., [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=74.4s)]
*  that he's having to grapple with here in his meetings with senators. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=77.68s)]
*  It's also his past statements about abortion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=81.36s)]
*  He has had various positions on this issue, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=84.16s)]
*  but many of those positions worry Republican senators who fear that he might [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  not be as anti-abortion and anti-choice as they would like him to be. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=91.64s)]
*  And so that's certainly one of the things that is also in the swirl here [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=96.6s)]
*  in the Senate that senators are grappling with. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=99.92s)]
*  Republicans have various members of this cabinet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=102.44s)]
*  It's not just RFK. It's also Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=105.96s)]
*  It's Pete Hegseth, who are controversial in their own ways. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=108.2s)]
*  And now that we're getting to a point where all of these nominees [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=112.12s)]
*  are up here on Capitol Hill, not just one or two. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=115.84s)]
*  It's, I think, a reminder for many reporters, many senators, many staffers, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=118.56s)]
*  that this is not just one confirmation battle that is going to be difficult, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=123.36s)]
*  thorny and controversial. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=126.84s)]
*  It's several of them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=128.52s)]
*  And it means that January is going to be a month of fireworks up here on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=129.56s)]
*  Oh, no doubt about that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=133.6s)]
*  So, David, let's talk a little bit about RFK Jr. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=135.08s)]
*  because you do have obviously vaccines. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=137.24s)]
*  You have abortion. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=140.24s)]
*  You have his comments about fossil fuels and the pollution they cause. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=141.28s)]
*  That as a health issue as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=145.68s)]
*  Some things that make folks on the right a little nervous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Could they stop the confirmation or ultimately do you think that Donald Trump will get his way? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=151.12s)]
*  I'm afraid Donald Trump will get his way. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=155.88s)]
*  I mean, I think what we saw during the Hegseth meetings on the Hill last week, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=157.4s)]
*  particularly if you isolate Joni Ernst and see the way she started to come around [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=161.24s)]
*  a little bit, the pressure from MAGA campaign, conservative media, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=165.12s)]
*  all of this is starting to feel a lot like the Kavanaugh hearings, where [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=169.08s)]
*  there are people with protestations publicly early on, but then they all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=172.08s)]
*  come into the fold. I think the greatest concern about, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=175.56s)]
*  particularly in the health care space with RFK Jr. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  and other health leaders that Donald Trump has picked is the abandonment of public health. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the role of government in those positions is to attend to the public health, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=185.4s)]
*  not necessarily your private health, but COVID is a perfect example. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=190.36s)]
*  How do we balance the needs of society to stay healthy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=193.12s)]
*  versus the individual freedom mantra that Republicans like to wrap themselves in? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  And then the societal costs that come from abandoning public health as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=200.44s)]
*  The posture of RFK Jr. with the rallying of Donald Trump and MAGA behind him [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=204.04s)]
*  could be a very dangerous chapter. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  And Michael, as Trump's C&I pic meets with lawmakers, sources tell [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  reporters at least eight Republicans are uncomfortable, at least eight [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  uncomfortable with Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=216.68s)]
*  We know she also met with one of the Democratic senators, John Fetterman. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=222.6s)]
*  Congresswoman, how was your meeting? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  It was great. This has been a great opportunity to meet with both Democrat [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  and Republican senators and address any questions or concerns that they have [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=232.48s)]
*  and talk about the role. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=237.56s)]
*  Did he seem open to supporting you? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=239.76s)]
*  I'm not going to speak for Senator Fetterman or any senator. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  I look forward to meeting with senators as we continue through this process. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  OK, pretty much every nomin pick in every meeting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=252.16s)]
*  It's great. Right. It's always great. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=256.32s)]
*  But having said that, there are folks who are saying this is different. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=257.84s)]
*  With her, because it's not about a specific position she takes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=262.36s)]
*  There's a lot of reporting out there that she's gone into these meetings [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=266.72s)]
*  unprepared, can't answer questions. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=269.92s)]
*  Is that a different thing in terms of how they vote? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=272.24s)]
*  It's a different thing because she both seems unprepared. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=275.64s)]
*  But also, we need to know the answer to one very basic question. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=278.2s)]
*  What happened in Syria? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=281.8s)]
*  That was a very weird situation that none of us really knows what happens. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=283.32s)]
*  I knew her at the time, and I recall when she came back, it was just weird. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=286.48s)]
*  She was different. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=290.32s)]
*  Her staff didn't know where she was. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=291.36s)]
*  And so what do you mean she was different? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=292.92s)]
*  I can't explain it, but she was far more quiet and reserved when she came back. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=295.32s)]
*  And serious. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=299.76s)]
*  So what did you think at the time? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=300.8s)]
*  None of us had any idea. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=302.88s)]
*  I had a friend in her office and the friend ended up quitting because she had no idea [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=303.88s)]
*  what was happening. And I think her staff also had concerns in terms of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=307.84s)]
*  they didn't know what was going on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=312.56s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=313.92s)]
*  I'm just saying that the FBI and others should be able to figure that out for us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=314.96s)]
*  Yeah. And still, but if you listen to people who have met with her, they still don't [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=318.76s)]
*  know the answer to that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=323.12s)]
*  I do. I served with her and I was being courted by the same people asking me to go to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=324.32s)]
*  Syria at the time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=328.8s)]
*  The issue was Democrats and Republicans had agreed on a certain foreign policy [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=330.24s)]
*  posture towards Assad. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=335.04s)]
*  The Syrian Christian community in the United States was making the case that Assad [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=336.6s)]
*  was at least protecting Syrian Christians. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  We call all of the ethnic civil war going on in Syria. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=343.24s)]
*  At the time, we were seeing heads on stakes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=346.12s)]
*  And so the Syrian Christian community was working with Congress, individual members [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=348.24s)]
*  of Congress, very hard to say, we're not telling you what the answer is, but please [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=352.0s)]
*  understand that Assad's protecting the Syrian Christians. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  And if we see regime change, which was something that was being discussed at the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=359.16s)]
*  time, Syrian Christians could get slaughtered. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  The question, though, comes down to Tulsi's judgment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=365.16s)]
*  Why did she then go? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=368.68s)]
*  Many of us were offered the same opportunity and said no. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=370.68s)]
*  She said yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think what is at the root of the suspicion around Tulsi Gabbard is there's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=374.64s)]
*  a lack of trust. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=379.48s)]
*  Senators don't trust her judgment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=380.56s)]
*  They don't trust her answers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=382.16s)]
*  Can she overcome that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=383.56s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=384.56s)]
*  Do you know anything about what happened or what her if there was a change in her [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=384.96s)]
*  might have happened when she was over there? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=389.88s)]
*  No, the the the issue was the meeting with Assad. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=391.4s)]
*  Yeah. And that's where all members of Congress said, no, we're not doing that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=394.64s)]
*  She said, yes, we will do that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=397.2s)]
*  I think that speaks to her judgment, raises real questions and a confirmation [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=398.84s)]
*  hearing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=401.96s)]
*  There's also a question of if one of these or more, I suppose you could say, but [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=402.4s)]
*  let's say one of these picks doesn't make it, who would they be replaced with? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=407.12s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports, for example, that Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  Jr. had a campaign to prevent Mike Pompeo from becoming the next defense secretary. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  So it does raise the question, Michael, who would have Donald Trump's ear? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=421.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And also, let's not forget about the fact that the Trump operation isn't a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  traditional one. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  And so just because someone has a certain position doesn't mean they actually have [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=432.12s)]
*  the president's ear on that particular topic. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  For instance, Donald Jr. doesn't currently work for the transition, but he has a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=437.76s)]
*  significant impact on decisions that are made there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=441.52s)]
*  And so that's another thing to consider when we figure out who's getting these roles [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=444.56s)]
*  in the cabinet, because the real question is who has the role influence there. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Unh9qYe4LY&t=448.59999999999997s)]
