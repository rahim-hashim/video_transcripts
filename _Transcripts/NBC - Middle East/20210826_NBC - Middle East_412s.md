# Refugees Should Not Be 'An Afterthought In US Foreign Policy': Hetfield
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg)
*  According to the new estimates by the New York Times, there are at least 250,000 Afghans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=0.0s)]
*  in Afghanistan who worked for the United States who haven't been evacuated yet. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=4.88s)]
*  So how will this latest attack on the ground impact evacuation efforts in the future for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=9.8s)]
*  these Afghan refugees? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=13.9s)]
*  Joining me now is Mark Hetfield. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=14.9s)]
*  He's the president and CEO of HIAS, who is focused on this issue of Afghan refugees right [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=16.4s)]
*  now to discuss this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=22.84s)]
*  So Mark, first of all, I know you've got a lot of contacts on the ground. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=24.2s)]
*  What are you hearing about safety and security and the ability to get out right now? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=27.6s)]
*  Well, Chuck, there is no safety and security and there is no ability to get out right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=33.32s)]
*  Even for people who are US citizens, even for people who are lawful permanent residents [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  or special immigrant visa holders, let alone the many vulnerable people, religious minorities, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  activists, people associated with US media or US NGOs, they can't get out right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=49.88s)]
*  There's 250,000 Afghans. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=56.36s)]
*  We know there's some Afghan Americans that can get out now, but they can't bring their [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=59.76s)]
*  families with them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=64.5s)]
*  Explain that struggle. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=66.08s)]
*  Is this more having to do with the Taliban or more having to do with our SIV process? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=68.52s)]
*  It has everything to do with our SIV process. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=74.52s)]
*  We had 20 years to prepare for this not unlikely outcome and it wasn't done. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=77.44s)]
*  And so as a result, we are now scrambling and there is a cascading effect because we're [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=84.88s)]
*  scrambling to help these SIVs who lay their lives down for American soldiers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=88.96s)]
*  We now are not paying enough attention to the other people who are vulnerable and need [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  assistance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=98.08s)]
*  So this is an absolute disaster. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=99.08s)]
*  Refugees have to stop being an afterthought in US foreign policy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=101.28s)]
*  It should be in the front of everybody's minds when we go into a situation like this 20 years [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=104.64s)]
*  ago. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  In fact, when we hear the president say, look, we're getting every American who wants to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=111.36s)]
*  get out to get out, the ones that say they don't want to get out, it's your understanding [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=115.08s)]
*  are most of them Afghan Americans who are not ready to leave because they can't bring [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=119.7s)]
*  their family with them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=123.62s)]
*  They want to get out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=124.68s)]
*  They just can't get out by themselves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=125.78s)]
*  Is that a better way to put it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=128.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=130.56s)]
*  And most SIVs hightail the data of Afghanistan as soon as they got the status to do so. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=131.56s)]
*  I mean, the SIV process, it's a 14 step process. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  And God knows if you were associated with the US military, you're not going to leave [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=140.34s)]
*  your family behind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=143.54s)]
*  So that's exactly it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=146.02s)]
*  There's just no leadership on this on this issue right now, Chuck. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=148.86s)]
*  There's no special envoy who's overseeing the humanitarian evacuation, the SIV process [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=152.02s)]
*  and the refugee process. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=157.1s)]
*  There's nobody at the UN who reports to the secretary general looking at this stuff either. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=158.7s)]
*  I don't understand why, but that has to there has to be some leadership on this issue. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=162.46s)]
*  There has to be somebody with authority. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=167.02s)]
*  Well, walk us through the scope of what you expect in the next year when it comes to Afghan [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=169.5s)]
*  refugees. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=174.38s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about so we have 250,000 Afghans who have a direct connection to the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=175.38s)]
*  United States operation who deserve some sort of special status. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, we're going to have a couple million Afghans who want to, you know, who are the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=182.98s)]
*  next level down, can't get that special, you know, can't qualify for the special visa, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=187.62s)]
*  but certainly aren't going to feel as if the Taliban are friendly to them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=192.82s)]
*  How many do you expect to try to get out and where do you expect them to try to go? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=197.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, there needs to be a humanitarian corridor established to get people out, whether [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  that's an air corridor or a land corridor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=208.1s)]
*  But it's very tough to leave Afghanistan in the winter. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=211.26s)]
*  It's almost impossible by land. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=213.98s)]
*  So people are going to be trapped there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=215.78s)]
*  There needs to and that needs to be a multinational force. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=217.78s)]
*  And if the US is going to leave at the end of the month, I don't know how that's going [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=220.1s)]
*  to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=223.06s)]
*  But we've seen this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  We've seen this show before, unfortunately, and we know that there's going to be hundreds [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=225.46s)]
*  and thousands or more fleeing for Pakistan and Tajikistan and Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=230.02s)]
*  And if you go to Iran, good luck trying to get to the United States from Iran. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=236.94s)]
*  Obviously, the rise in this nationalism, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, has made these [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=240.38s)]
*  refugee and migrant flows even more complicated. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=247.54s)]
*  Are you having a hard time? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=251.46s)]
*  I mean, even the politics in our country, you want to know why we don't have a czar [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=252.46s)]
*  and refugees. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=256.5s)]
*  I might point to our current politics when it comes to what's happened on this issue, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=257.5s)]
*  particularly on the right side of our political spectrum. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=263.54s)]
*  Are you having more trouble with Western nations being open to taking in these refugees? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=266.54s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=273.42s)]
*  I mean, that's the problem is we have refugees that are trying. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=275.82s)]
*  Well, they're not refugees yet because they're stuck in Afghanistan. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to get out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=281.46s)]
*  They have flights lined up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=282.78s)]
*  They have planes lined up, but they have no place to go. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=284.12s)]
*  So people aren't flying out. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=287.46s)]
*  So absolutely, they have absolutely no place to go, whether it's the United States or a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=289.32s)]
*  country in Europe or in the Middle East. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  It's a St. Louis situation, but people aren't even able to leave Afghanistan. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=298.7s)]
*  When I say St. Louis, I mean the ship of German refugees. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=301.82s)]
*  German refugees turned away before World War II. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=307.7s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=313.78s)]
*  Who do you deal with in the administration and who would you like to get some more face [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=315.38s)]
*  time with? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=319.68s)]
*  I mean, it does sound like you have hit your bit at your wits end here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=320.68s)]
*  Well, the thing with the refugee program, one of the flaws of it is its accountability [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  spread across multiple agencies, the State Department, Health and Human Services, Homeland [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=329.9s)]
*  Security, then multiple vetting agencies, law enforcement agencies and intelligence [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=334.9s)]
*  agencies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=341.9s)]
*  And then they need the Department of Defense to implement right now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=342.9s)]
*  And so there's no one person. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  There needs to be somebody who reports to the president who can coordinate all of these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=348.26s)]
*  different pieces. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=351.7s)]
*  I mean, that's what's missing here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=352.7s)]
*  So the person I should be talking to doesn't exist. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=354.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's basically what you're arguing for is that there needs to be almost a single [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=358.29999999999995s)]
*  person put in charge right now because this is turning into a bureaucratic calamity is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=363.56s)]
*  what you're describing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=368.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=369.84s)]
*  Who reports to the president and can really make things happen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=370.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=373.8s)]
*  Mark Hetfield, the head of HIAS, who is working tirelessly on this refugee situation or what [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=374.8s)]
*  in some ways we hope becomes a refugee situation because it means these folks were able to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=381.2s)]
*  actually get out of Afghanistan. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=384.76s)]
*  Mark, thanks for coming on and expressing your perspective with us. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=386.28s)]
*  Thank you, Chuck. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25N-nvngVg&t=390.68s)]
