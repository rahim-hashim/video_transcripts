# 'Extremely difficult negotiation' to determine who will control Gaza border: Col. Jacobs
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg)
*  And so, Colonel, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is under tremendous pressure from protesters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=0.0s)]
*  at home demanding a hostage deal, and his own defense minister is saying the goal of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=5.72s)]
*  totally destroying Hamas is, quote, nonsense. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=10.6s)]
*  Senior U.S. officials told The New York Times that Israel has done all it can militarily. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=13.84s)]
*  Do you believe Israel can achieve its stated goals of destroying Hamas and bring home the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=18.96s)]
*  hostages by force at this point? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=24.32s)]
*  Well, the short answer is no. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=27.520000000000003s)]
*  That was not an achievable objective, even at the beginning of the war, totally destroying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=29.520000000000003s)]
*  Hamas and getting all the hostages back. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=38.0s)]
*  They're not going to get all the hostages back, as we know. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=40.72s)]
*  And one of the sticking points is, in what phased array are hostages going to be released? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=44.36s)]
*  Another sticking point, and one that hasn't been addressed fully and may not be addressed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=51.559999999999995s)]
*  fully, is who is going to control the border of Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, Israel wants to control the southern border to make sure that there is no further [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  entrance of A, militants, and B, weapons into Gaza when the shooting stops. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  But neither Hamas nor Egypt wants that to happen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  So it's going to be an extremely difficult negotiation to get that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=79.44s)]
*  Somebody's going to have to give in the end. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  Hamas cannot be totally destroyed, and they will be resurgence of it as long as Iran wants [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=85.7s)]
*  there to be a resurgence of it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=93.1s)]
*  And not all of the hostages will be released, certainly not the first time around, Jose. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=95.22s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, there's so many kind of different possible outcomes of what could [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=101.78s)]
*  happen in Israel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the consequences of these peace talks go far beyond Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=110.42s)]
*  It could determine whether Israel is plunged into an all-out war with Lebanon or with Iran. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=113.7s)]
*  But each of those countries has serious domestic problems. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Lebanon has been dealing with a dire economic crisis for years, according to The [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  New York Times. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=129.26000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah is worried the Lebanese people could turn on them if they drag them into the war. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=130.26000000000002s)]
*  In Iran, not long ago, they had mass protests against the regime, a regime that has been [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=135.18s)]
*  violating the rights of its people since 1979. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  The supreme leader there is 85 years old. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=143.34s)]
*  His presumed successor died in a helicopter crash back in May. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  All these groups have vowed to retaliate against Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=150.62s)]
*  How can the U.S. and its allies take advantage of this uncertain moment to maybe keep a lid [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=153.42s)]
*  on these tensions and maybe even, you know, avoid a greater war? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=161.17999999999998s)]
*  You know, what's really interesting is that the United States is using all the elements [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=169.1s)]
*  of policy, all the instruments of foreign policy in order to prevent a larger war and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=174.22s)]
*  to influence the combatants here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=180.58s)]
*  One is diplomacy, and we've already spoken about that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=184.5s)]
*  Continued effort in that regard, especially using intermediaries like Qatar and others [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=187.58s)]
*  and Egypt, is going to be of great assistance in maintaining, keeping the lid on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=192.34s)]
*  Second is the use of the economic instrument. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  The United States has been very successful in using economics to try to keep the lid [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=200.9s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=207.62s)]
*  You mentioned a very interesting thing about the internal politics of Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=209.22s)]
*  The person who was elected just recently was elected as a reformer and immediately fired [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=213.74s)]
*  as vice president. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=220.3s)]
*  So he was heavily influenced by what the mullahs said. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=221.42s)]
*  But the undercurrent of the populace's discontent with the regime is always an influence here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=224.74s)]
*  discontented the populace inside Iran is, the easier it's going to be for the United [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=235.06s)]
*  States and other clear thinking people in the region to keep things quiet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=239.98s)]
*  At the end of the day, Hezbollah is a major independent variable here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=244.82s)]
*  It's funded by Iran, trained by Iran, supported by Iran, but it makes decisions often by itself. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=249.82s)]
*  A mistake by Hezbollah is liable to tip the balance and may make things much, much worse. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=257.82s)]
*  For the time being, things will remain as quiet as they have been as long as the United [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  States continues doing what it's doing and its allies and people who are assisting it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=268.18s)]
*  are keep doing what it's doing, Jose. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=273.74s)]
*  And Colonel, I want to take advantage of having you here and the privilege of our conversations [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=277.34s)]
*  always. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=282.14s)]
*  I know that as a Medal of Honor recipient, I just wanted to play for you something former [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=283.14s)]
*  President Trump said yesterday. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=289.14s)]
*  I want your thoughts after you listen to what he said. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  We gave Miriam the Presidential Medal of Freedom. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=295.38s)]
*  That's the highest award you can get as a civilian. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  It's the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  It's actually much better because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=307.18s)]
*  That soldiers, they're either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=311.62s)]
*  by bullets or they're dead. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  But, Colonel, just what are your thoughts on what he said? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, it depends on how much time we have. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is the least adroit public speaker in my memory, and I'm pretty old, and so I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  remember a lot of public speakers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=332.22s)]
*  It's difficult often to figure out what the guy is saying in the first instance. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=335.74s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=341.3s)]
*  And most people are not entirely certain that he knows what he's talking about. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=342.3s)]
*  Every time he talks, it's extremely digressive. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=346.82s)]
*  Goes from one subject to another without finishing the first subject. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=350.38s)]
*  But we have to remember that in this particular case, remember that Donald Trump is the same [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=354.46s)]
*  guy who some time ago said that people suggested and said directly about the First World War [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=358.5s)]
*  Marines that anybody who serves this country is a sucker. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=364.82s)]
*  We also have to remember that it's Donald Trump who managed to avoid the draft by having [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  this deleterious bone spur on his foot. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=375.9s)]
*  You're looking at somebody here, me, who believes that everybody who's lucky enough to live [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  in a free country owes it something in the form of service. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  We have to constantly be mindful of what the first century Hebrew scholar Hillel said, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=387.58s)]
*  if I am only for myself, what am I? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  And after that, you can probably conclude if you're only for yourself, you may in fact [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=398.14s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=403.22s)]
*  An extremely unfortunate thing to say by somebody who says a large number of very unfortunate [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=404.66s)]
*  things, Jose. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=410.1s)]
*  Colonel Jack Jacobs, I thank you very much for your service and I thank you very much [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=411.1s)]
*  for being with us today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=416.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuErJgVxkg&t=417.38s)]
