# Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic)
*  And I have an Israeli official in Tel Aviv messaging me now that the foreign minister, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=0.0s)]
*  Foreign Minister Katz, has just confirmed that he is dead. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=7.0s)]
*  I'm looking throughout the rest of my phone, but so far they're expecting a confirmation [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=10.0s)]
*  from the prime minister, but that may not come immediately, but we are told now, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=16.0s)]
*  I am told from an Israeli official that the foreign minister has said this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=21.0s)]
*  I've got it in Hebrew and I'm looking for the English translation in my phone, Peter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=27.0s)]
*  If this is in fact true, it's just an extraordinary development. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=32.0s)]
*  This is the mastermind of October 7th. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=40.0s)]
*  He is a Hamas leader who, according to Israeli and U.S. officials, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=43.0s)]
*  has been the single biggest obstacle to a ceasefire. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=48.0s)]
*  He is, according to senior Israeli officials, the person who jumped the gun [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=52.0s)]
*  on the terror plan against Israel from Iran, Hezbollah, the other proxies, and Hamas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=59.0s)]
*  And October 7th was a surprise to them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=67.0s)]
*  It was something that they had been working on, but Sinemore took it on himself. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=70.0s)]
*  Here's a statement from the foreign minister. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=74.0s)]
*  This is from Foreign Minister Israel Katz, just handed to me. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=76.0s)]
*  It is a personal statement to dozens of foreign ministers worldwide. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=79.0s)]
*  Quote, terrorist mastermind Yahya Sinemore, responsible for the massacre [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=83.0s)]
*  and atrocities of October 7th, was eliminated today by IDF soldiers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=88.0s)]
*  This is a great military and moral achievement for Israel and a victory [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=93.0s)]
*  for the entire free world against the axis of radical Islam led by Iran. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=97.0s)]
*  The elimination of Sinemore creates an opportunity for the immediate release [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=101.0s)]
*  of the hostages and a potential change that would lead to a new reality in Gaza [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=105.0s)]
*  without Hamas and without Iranian control. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=109.0s)]
*  Foreign Minister Katz added, Israel now needs your support and assistance [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=112.0s)]
*  more than ever to advance these crucial goals together. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=116.0s)]
*  She points out that the Israeli cabinet is a divided cabinet, politically divided, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=119.0s)]
*  and there are right-wing members who are even more conservative, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=125.0s)]
*  some would say radically conservative, one of whom was on a U.S. terror list [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=129.0s)]
*  in the past, and they were in disagreement with Defense Minister Gallat, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=134.0s)]
*  with other members of the cabinet, with members who left the war cabinet [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=140.0s)]
*  like Minister Gantz. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=145.0s)]
*  So this is from one minister, but the cabinet was briefed earlier today, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=147.0s)]
*  as we have been reporting, that it was likely Sinemore. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=151.0s)]
*  The visual evidence seemed to support that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=154.0s)]
*  They were waiting for DNA, and I still have not seen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=157.0s)]
*  I'm going to look into my phone, Peter, but why don't you... [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=161.0s)]
*  And Richard Engel is joining us now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=165.0s)]
*  Peter, let me just bring Richard Engel in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=167.0s)]
*  Richard, that confirmation, and you had reported that officials were telling us [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=170.0s)]
*  for several hours that they believed it was Sinemore based on visual evidence, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=175.0s)]
*  based on what the troops still there were telling them, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=180.0s)]
*  but they didn't have the DNA, and I'm not sure that they do yet, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=183.0s)]
*  but this is the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, saying so. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=187.0s)]
*  So the Foreign Minister has just said that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=193.0s)]
*  I also have a senior U.S. military official saying, to me, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=195.0s)]
*  quote, it's definitely him. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=199.0s)]
*  This official did not specify how the United States knew that, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=201.0s)]
*  didn't mention if it was facial recognition or DNA, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=206.0s)]
*  but expressed as clear as could possibly be said [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=210.0s)]
*  that Yahya Sinemore, the mastermind of the October 7 attacks, is dead. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=214.0s)]
*  And the way he was killed, I think, is also very interesting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=219.0s)]
*  For months, U.S. and Israeli officials believed that Sinemore had been hiding in caves, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=223.0s)]
*  excuse me, hiding in tunnels underneath the cities and villages of the Gaza Strip, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=230.0s)]
*  that he had at times gone off the grid. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=236.0s)]
*  The only communications with him were through a handful of aides who had direct contact. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=240.0s)]
*  He didn't use cell phones, similar to other leaders like the Hezbollah leader, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=246.0s)]
*  but Israel found other ways to get to Hezbollah using more antiquated technology [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=253.0s)]
*  that they preferred thinking it was more secure, like walkie-talkies and pagers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=258.0s)]
*  In this case, it seems that Yahya Sinemore was moving around, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=263.0s)]
*  was in a building above ground, that he was with at least two other fighters. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=268.0s)]
*  The images that I've seen, that you've seen, Andrea, that I believe we're not showing yet, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=273.0s)]
*  they're very graphic, show someone who looks very much like Sinemore, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=277.0s)]
*  dressed in a military-style uniform, a gun near him, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=281.0s)]
*  shot, may have been other damage in a building that is completely destroyed, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=287.0s)]
*  his body identifiable, but showing lots of many, many different casualties. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=293.0s)]
*  So if that is him, and this is in fact confirmed, and the foreign minister says it is, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=299.0s)]
*  this military official that I'm speaking to says that it is, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=304.0s)]
*  it is an enormous blow to Hamas, he is the leader of the organization, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=307.0s)]
*  he'd been someone that has been on the run for months, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=311.0s)]
*  and he had been, as you said, seen as an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire agreement, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=315.0s)]
*  that he didn't want to do it, he thought expanding the war, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=320.0s)]
*  now that the war is expanding to Lebanon, the war has already expanded to the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=324.0s)]
*  would help Hamas, would help him personally, because it would take some of the pressure off of Gaza, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=329.0s)]
*  because the Israeli military had to fight on so many different fronts, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=334.0s)]
*  both in the front to the north, in Lebanon, and the Gaza front to the south, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=339.0s)]
*  that clearly didn't slow Israel down, Israeli forces are still fighting in southern Lebanon, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=344.0s)]
*  still carrying out airstrikes in Beirut and other places, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=351.0s)]
*  and on the offensive right now all across the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=354.0s)]
*  So it seems that he was moving, that he was cornered, and that they finally closed in and killed him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=357.0s)]
*  Of course, the fear, the initial fear was, what will be the response from his fellow terrorists, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=365.0s)]
*  and will they take this out against the hostages? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=372.0s)]
*  Some of them are clearly guarding the hostages, he was not. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=375.0s)]
*  Well, according to the Israelis, they cornered him in this firefight, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=381.0s)]
*  they did not know specifically that Sinwar was in the location, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=386.0s)]
*  it was in an area of Gaza City, in an area called Tell el Sultan, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=390.0s)]
*  it's an area that is completely destroyed, I actually visited it relatively recently, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=395.0s)]
*  I went in with the Israeli military, which is the only way that foreign journalists could get into Gaza, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=399.0s)]
*  and in this area, it was the same location, and by the way, completely devastated, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=404.0s)]
*  not a single building standing, the only sign of life that I saw were a few stray animals, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=410.0s)]
*  and of course the Israeli soldiers who were with us, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=415.0s)]
*  and the reason that the IDF took this group of reporters to this location in Tell el Sultan [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=418.0s)]
*  was to show they had had a tremendous amount of fighting there, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=425.0s)]
*  to show the extent of the damage, and specifically to show the location [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=428.0s)]
*  where Hamas had held and then executed six hostages not long ago, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=432.0s)]
*  and in this area, it was believed, according to US intelligence and Israeli intelligence, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=439.0s)]
*  that Sinwar had been seen in the past, or signs of his presence had been found in the past, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=445.0s)]
*  so if in fact he wasn't killed in this area in some sort of military uniform, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=450.0s)]
*  flanked by at least two other gunmen, himself carrying a gun, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=456.0s)]
*  it would show a leader who was isolated geographically, left with a small group of people, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=461.0s)]
*  these two or perhaps a few others, and on the run, not hiding out in a tunnel, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=469.0s)]
*  as had been the intelligence assessment of many in the past. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=477.0s)]
*  And we should point out, he's a former prisoner, you know this so well, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=481.0s)]
*  who had been released in a prisoner trade, but as a prisoner, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=485.0s)]
*  he became very well versed in Israeli military tactics, intelligence tactics, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=489.0s)]
*  he'd been interrogated of course, and also had been able to communicate through messengers, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=494.0s)]
*  because he would never use a cell phone, he knew well enough how he could be either tracked [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=503.0s)]
*  or blown up and executed through electronic devices by the Israelis. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=508.0s)]
*  And he knew the value of hostages, he knew the value of hostages as well, Andrea, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=512.0s)]
*  he was in jail, as you mentioned, for many years in different Israeli detention facilities and prisons, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=516.0s)]
*  and was very sick while he was in jail, was treated by Israelis who basically saved his life, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=523.0s)]
*  but the only reason he was freed was with the kidnapping and then the prisoner exchange [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=530.0s)]
*  for an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, so he himself saw the power of taking hostages [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=537.0s)]
*  and how they could be used as leverage over Israeli society, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=544.0s)]
*  use them to pressure the Israeli government, and now, well, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=548.0s)]
*  what that means for the hostages after this is an open question, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=552.0s)]
*  will the kidnappers then use this as an opportunity to carry out some sort of vengeance [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=556.0s)]
*  on the defenseless hostages, or will they now see them as even more valuable, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=561.0s)]
*  potentially more valuable bargaining chips? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=566.0s)]
*  But there is also another way of looking at this, Andrea, the Gaza Strip is so devastated right now, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=569.0s)]
*  it could be that the actual leadership of Yehya Sinwar is not necessarily as important as it might be [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=576.0s)]
*  in organizations that are more intact. There's so much damage in Gaza, there's so much anger, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=582.0s)]
*  there's so much frustration there after a year of devastation that perhaps another person steps in. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=588.0s)]
*  We will see. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=595.0s)]
*  Richard, I now have confirmation from an Israeli source and an Israeli official [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=597.0s)]
*  that the fingerprint of the body matches Sinwar's fingerprint, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=602.0s)]
*  which is in the IDF file from when he was a prisoner. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=607.0s)]
*  Now, that is a very trustworthy Israeli official texting me this just now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABsucUZCic&t=611.0s)]
