# Seems like Trump is listening to ‘whoever will give him the Nobel Peace Prize’ on Iran: Strategist
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA)
*  So, Meghan, was this rift inevitable? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=0.0s)]
*  Because Trump in the campaign, I mean, he repeatedly promoted America First. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=3.56s)]
*  How did Trump supporters interpret that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=8.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=11.24s)]
*  I mean, of course it was inevitable, right? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=12.24s)]
*  Because when you don't stand for anything, you stand for nothing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=14.56s)]
*  And so he just listens to whoever's in the room last. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=16.84s)]
*  Most presidents have a national security adviser and have a national security counsel, but [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=19.68s)]
*  he decided to get rid of those things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=22.96s)]
*  So now he gets to listen to Fox News and to other different outlets and podcasters give [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=24.6s)]
*  opinions and make decisions for our national security and for what's best for the rest [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  of the world, which is just, I mean, of course it was inevitable and we all saw it coming, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=33.04s)]
*  but we just never thought it would happen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=37.44s)]
*  So more than which of these two factions is Trump listening to at this point? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, based on his Twitter account or his true social account, it's whoever will give [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  him the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=50.22s)]
*  He seems very hell bent on making sure that he gets credit for whatever he thinks is his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=51.62s)]
*  diplomatic efforts here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=56.66s)]
*  But he also, a lot of this unfortunately comes down to ego and the president wants to make [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=57.82s)]
*  sure that he is appearing to be the strongest man in the room and gets things done the way [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  that he wants to get them done. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=67.58s)]
*  So if he feels that Iran is not coming to the table, which they have not, then he is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=68.58s)]
*  faced with this choice and then making these threats. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=73.14s)]
*  But to Megan's point, I think when you're for nothing, you're actually hands up being [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=75.66s)]
*  for everything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=79.06s)]
*  So all options to him are constantly on the table and that's a problem because it is based [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=80.2s)]
*  on whoever he's speaking to last. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=84.84s)]
*  But you're already hearing the MAGA base that are such diehard loyalists saying, you know, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=86.2s)]
*  it's not intervention if he just helps assist with a few bombs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=92.64s)]
*  It's not intervention if. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=95.5s)]
*  So they're already making excuses for it to keep with their isolationist viewpoints, whereas [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=96.84s)]
*  I don't think Trump ever was an isolationist. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  It's really an opportunist mentality. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=104.76s)]
*  And let me tell you, intervention. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=108.36s)]
*  I mean, that'll be interpreted by the person on whom we may be intervening. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=109.6s)]
*  I mean, my goodness. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=114.72s)]
*  OK, flip side question to you, Megan, because Bill Kristol argues this is for the bulwark, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=115.72s)]
*  that the promise of America first is dead if it ever really existed at all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=121.44s)]
*  And he writes, quote, The fact is, for all the talk about rejecting globalists, the experience [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=124.92s)]
*  of the Trump administration is one of intervening repeatedly in global affairs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=130.96s)]
*  Is Kristol right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=137.32s)]
*  And is it clear? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=138.58s)]
*  This is the flip side to the question I asked you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=140.02s)]
*  Is it clear how Trump defines America first? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=141.9s)]
*  Well, I agree with Maura here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=145.5s)]
*  Sort of on the last question, it works with that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  He is for whatever is best for Donald Trump and whatever is going to make him the most. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=150.74s)]
*  So he intervenes on things because he wants to be seen as a dictator. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=154.58s)]
*  He looks to Putin as someone who he respects greatly. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  So of course he was going to intervene with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=161.06s)]
*  He's been intervening on all sorts of things like NATO and different issues. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=163.82s)]
*  He became president again, but he only cares about what's best for him and what's going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=167.62s)]
*  to make him the most money. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=172.66s)]
*  So it's not America first. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=173.94s)]
*  It's Trump first. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=175.1s)]
*  So then there's Maura, far-right activist Laura Loomer, who's threatened to expose [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  MAGA supporters who criticize Trump's policy on Iran and despite collecting social media [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  posts and then delivering them to the president. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=185.62s)]
*  She has also unleashed an expletive-filled tirade on social media, ranting against Tucker [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  Carlson for speaking out against potential military action against Iran. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=192.92s)]
*  Is she someone to be taken seriously given the access she has to the president and that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  she may have drilled into certainly a large group of MAGA mentality? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Listen, I'm all for when someone calls out Tucker Carlson for truly being an opportunist [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=210.16s)]
*  in terms of foreign propaganda and being paid and bought by people like Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=216.38s)]
*  I invite them there to go to a grocery shop. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=222.04s)]
*  We'll never forget that video. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=223.6s)]
*  And so I'm all for that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=225.0s)]
*  But I'm not going to sit here and pretend as though Laura Loomer has some sort of voice [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=226.0s)]
*  in the Republican Party or in politics in general. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  She's a conspiracy theorist who has spread dangerous ideas and dangerous theories that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  impact real families. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  Her 9-11 conspiracy theories are damaging. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  And so the Republican Party at large is not going to take her seriously. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=239.72s)]
*  However, the problem is, is that Donald Trump seems to have already done so. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=245.12s)]
*  You mentioned NSA and the Cyber Command General. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=248.32s)]
*  We still don't have a general there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=251.0s)]
*  And so that poses a threat to us as a nation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=252.8s)]
*  But for Republicans at large, I do think that behind the scenes, they've been able to convince [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=256.64s)]
*  President Trump about the important role America has and that it is putting America first by [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=260.68s)]
*  making sure that we continue to lead on the world stage. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=264.68s)]
*  And so there is definitely some nuances going on. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=268.0s)]
*  I don't and I hope that Laura Loomer is not part of those because I just don't see her [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=270.48s)]
*  to be a serious person that we should be even having conversations about, quite frankly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=274.6s)]
*  OK, I've gotten the clue. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=278.92s)]
*  I'm going to move on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=280.16s)]
*  So, Megan, Democrats have gotten a jolt of energy from the No Kings protest. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=281.6s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=286.16s)]
*  I mean, organizer Ezra Levin spoke to my colleague, Chris Hayes, about just that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=287.0s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=291.36s)]
*  You got to recognize Congress isn't the only actor in this game. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  We launched earlier this week something we've called One Million Rising, which is an effort [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=297.48s)]
*  to train up people all around the country on how they can focus on their universities, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=302.24s)]
*  their media institutions, their businesses, the law firms in their communities and use [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=306.88s)]
*  organized people power to push those institutions to uphold democracy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=311.84s)]
*  So there's also another protest that's planned in just a few weeks. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=318.04s)]
*  Will this be effective? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=321.48s)]
*  Is it all building towards something real and influential? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=322.96s)]
*  I think that the movement here in general is a good one. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=329.68s)]
*  I think that the Democratic Party has been looking for leadership and I think that everyone [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=332.6s)]
*  just need to turn inward and we are the leaders of our party. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=335.84s)]
*  Congress has not provided a path for people to do that, but these protests have and people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=339.28s)]
*  like Indivisible and Ezra organization, they've given people a platform to show and to express [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  their feelings and to show that they really do care about democracy and they're not just [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  going to stand in line behind Donald Trump, regardless of that's whatever he throws at [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  them next. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  So I do think these things are really helpful. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=357.4s)]
*  And also all politics is local. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=359.55999999999995s)]
*  These are organizing in different communities, small towns, big cities. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=361.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's really important. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  The Democratic Party has either overperformed or won in 30 of 33 down ballot races since [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=366.0s)]
*  the presidential election. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=372.12s)]
*  That's an incredible statistic that we're not talking about for Democrats actually do [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=373.44s)]
*  have a lot of power in their and down ballot races and in their communities. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=377.48s)]
*  So Mara with the vast number of protesters we've seen, you know, five million at least [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=381.72s)]
*  nationwide is opposition to Trump now crossing party lines. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=385.56s)]
*  Are Republicans and independents saying, hey, this isn't what I voted for. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=389.24s)]
*  And is there an opportunity to seize? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=394.28s)]
*  I mean, these protests have been peaceful. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  The ones that have been peaceful have been really powerful and impactful. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=399.52s)]
*  And you're seeing an incredible turnout. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=402.2s)]
*  Now, the question becomes, can they keep the momentum going? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  Can they build upon that by expanding to independents or disenfranchised Republicans [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=407.2s)]
*  who are disappointed about what's happening in the Trump White House? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=412.55999999999995s)]
*  And can they keep it going until 2026? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. So that becomes the question about how they plan for the future and how to keep [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=417.4s)]
*  the momentum going. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  I will say that I think that focusing on the ice rays that are upsetting communities, both [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=423.16s)]
*  from Republicans and Democrats across this country, is an effective message. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  What won't be effective is what Congresswoman AOC just did was pushing Khalil's message, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=432.32s)]
*  Mohammed Khalil. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=437.6s)]
*  That's not a message that's going to resonate with the American people. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=438.76s)]
*  It's actually goes back to what Republicans won on in 2024 is the arrogance of Khalil's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=441.0s)]
*  message there because he's here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=447.32s)]
*  It's a privilege to be in this country. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  And when that feels when people feel like it's being taken advantage of, which I think [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  that that interview just showed when he was talking with AOC there, that's going to be [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  a negative on Democrats that they push that kind of a message. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  So focusing on the peaceful protest is going to be their best bet. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-yl2sW1gA&t=461.48s)]
