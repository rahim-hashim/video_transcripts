*  NBC's Andrea Mitchell who is traveling with Secretary Blinken and Aaron David [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=0.0s)]
*  Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=4.12s)]
*  former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator. So Andrea, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=7.8s)]
*  Secretary of State Blinken back in the region as are you trying to in his case [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=10.44s)]
*  reach a ceasefire deal and bring the hostages home. What are the chances of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=15.24s)]
*  this happening? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=19.0s)]
*  Very very slim. The terrible situation of the explosions over Lebanon just today [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=21.96s)]
*  two apartment buildings collapsed were leveled by Israeli airstrikes in Beirut [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=29.24s)]
*  and two children we know died several children died in the eight among the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  18 people found in the rubble according to the Lebanese Health Service and to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=41.96s)]
*  our correspondent there. So the crisis continues Gaza people are starving in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=46.28s)]
*  North Northern Gaza and the Zhebalia refugee camp there have been airstrikes [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=52.32s)]
*  there and this as Secretary Blinken was landing all this happening the press the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=56.32s)]
*  pressure from the US from Blinken today with Netanyahu to get food into northern [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=62.04s)]

*  them attacking Israel attacking Lebanon near the southern border with Israel but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=85.0s)]
*  not the attacks on Beirut and also pressing Israel to keep its expected [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=90.16s)]
*  retaliation against Iran proportional that means to keep with what they have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=95.12s)]
*  been told by the Israelis that it will not hit nuclear sites that will not hit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=99.88s)]
*  energy sites that they'll go after offensive weapons and try to avoid [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=104.68s)]
*  escalating it to the point where Iran's expected response will spread to a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=109.84s)]
*  wider war. And I know Andrea that you also spoke with Aviva Siegel she's a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=115.32000000000001s)]

*  her today before she and other American hostages later tonight will be meeting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=136.96s)]
*  with Secretary Blinken this was the most emotional that I have seen her because [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=141.08s)]
*  she feels that the death of Sinwar will further endanger the possibility of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=145.84s)]
*  retaliation against her husband Keith she was a hostage for 51 days she [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=151.04000000000002s)]

*  here is more of what she said to me. What do you want Netanyahu to do? I would [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=168.4s)]
*  like Bibi Netanyahu to understand that if Keith doesn't come home now he's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=174.8s)]
*  gonna come home dead and I want him home I want him home alive one more day [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=181.2s)]
*  underneath the ground I would have died and Keith would have died too I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=185.96s)]
*  wouldn't to be sitting here next to you because I would be dead so I'm so [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=191.56s)]

*  and she she's so worried about her husband and the other hostages and says [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=210.32s)]
*  it's time to end this war and she's just pleading with the US to put more [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=216.68s)]
*  pressure on Netanyahu and pleading with her own with their government she's an [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSG_xJmD7lU&t=221.54s)]
