Video Description: In Michigan and Wisconsin in particular, victory or defeat could come down to voters who are considering casting "protest votes". Primarily motivated by their anger over the Biden-Harris administration’s continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza, some uncommitted voters may vote for a third-party candidate, vote for Trump, or abstain from voting altogether. “What it comes down to is, what can you do to help the people of Gaza to the maximum degree that you can?” says Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. “To me, that's to support the person who says they want a ceasefire, the person who says they want humanitarian assistance and want to uphold international human rights law.”

# AG Keith Ellison: ‘It is important to see through our tears’
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM)
*  Joining me now is Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota. He's a former United States congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=0.0s)]
*  Who represented the state's fifth district that encompasses all of Minneapolis. Attorney general, good to see you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=5.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. We were just talking Michael Beschloss and I about the historical [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=11.36s)]
*  Approach to the strategy of voting for a third party candidate. It's interesting in this country [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=17.76s)]
*  It has often worked against the interests of the people who have done it and that's the situation we're in with three days out [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=23.28s)]
*  I thought the concept of an uncommitted movement during the primaries was was a remarkable [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=29.04s)]
*  Demonstration of democracy right people going in there and saying I am [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=34.72s)]
*  Dissatisfied with something that's happening and you need to change your approach [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=38.3s)]
*  I'm a little worried about it three days into an election particularly in a place like Michigan or and Wisconsin [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and let me just say Ali. I agree 100 with the sentiment [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=48.56s)]
*  People should and need to register their their discontent and their demand for a different sort of policy [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=53.6s)]
*  but voting third party in this race is simply going to empower [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=61.36s)]
*  The person who will do the worst. I mean the fact of the matter is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=66.08s)]
*  Donald trump has said only that continue the job. He has said that he's allowed rude. Giuliani to falsely accuse [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=70.4s)]
*  Palestinian toddlers of wanting to kill americans is complete lie and a racist lie at that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=79.91999999999999s)]
*  And so a vote for a third party is just going to empower them [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  So the what comes down to is what can you do? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=90.32s)]
*  To help the people of gaza [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Uh the the to the maximum degree that you can [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=97.28s)]
*  And to me that's to support the person who says they want to ceasefire [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=100.88s)]
*  The person who says they want humanitarian assistance and want to uphold international human rights law [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=105.12s)]
*  Why is that not satisfying enough to to to people and I get it. I i'm with you. I get the sentiment sentiment completely, but [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=112.4s)]
*  What she has said I will everybody will have a seat at the table [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=119.28s)]
*  She has said very clearly including next to benjamin netanyahu that she wants to cease fire [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=123.12s)]
*  She wants the hostages released and she wants a two-state solution in which palestinians and israelis equally [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=127.52s)]
*  Can can live in safety and security with self-determination [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's just the emotionality of it. I mean you sit down and you talk to people who've lost [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=137.28s)]
*  Multiple family members and for them. It's just an emotional bridge that it's difficult to cross [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=142.0s)]
*  but what I say to them is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=149.12s)]
*  You're not doing your family members any good by putting trump in there [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=152.0s)]
*  You you you you may well be able to help them by empowering somebody who has said [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  That they are that they are concerned and want that same ceasefire that you want [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=161.6s)]
*  Even in dearborn the other day trump was asked. Are you in support of a two-state solution? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=166.72s)]
*  And he uh, he demurred he wouldn't say that he was so it's very clear [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=171.92s)]
*  That um, you know, he's not going to do anything of any good and it's very clear that kamaharis has voiced [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  her support so to me [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  Uh, the the logical argument is there but you still got to overcome that emotional [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=186.56s)]
*  Barrier people are in pain people are hurting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=191.28s)]
*  Donald trump has said things like let them finish it when it's very very vague what that's supposed to mean [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=194.32s)]
*  Let them I don't know who them is and what finish it means. He's talked about beachfront property in gaza [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=200.16s)]
*  He's talked about the fact that joe biden has constrained [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=204.72s)]
*  Netanyahu and he would let him do whatever the hell he wants [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  He's talked about the fact that he has regular [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=211.68s)]
*  Conversations with benjamin netanyahu, which might be a violation of the the logan act. He seems to be running a shadow foreign policy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=214.14s)]
*  And he's the guy who had the muslim ban [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=221.84s)]
*  He's the guy who had the muslim ban [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=224.48s)]
*  So whether or not and I I think we have to separate these two arguments you may be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=226.56s)]
*  Highly dissatisfied with joe biden's activities as it's related to this and you might be dissatisfied that kamala harris has not [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=230.88s)]
*  Created enough space between her and joe biden [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=237.28s)]
*  But this is a binary election [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=240.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way we have to think about it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  The other guy has said a whole bunch of very specific things that to your point are not going to help [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=243.04s)]
*  Whatever you're concerned about in that part of the world [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  So the question is what's the best thing you can do to help people you are concerned about? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=250.56s)]
*  To support the position that the person who says they want to cease fire [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  Or the person who just doesn't care and has demonstrated hostility to the muslim community [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=260.32s)]
*  As recently as uh madison square garden. I mean that that is what's in front of us right now [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=265.44s)]
*  It is important [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=271.6s)]
*  To see through our tears man. I mean quite honestly [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=273.12s)]
*  It is important to do the best thing we can those of us who are not living under bombs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=276.48s)]
*  Need to do what we can for the people who are and that means getting a a u.s president [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=282.32000000000005s)]
*  Who's oh who's at least willing? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  Uh and agrees that that a ceasefire is is is needed and needed now [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  It's a strong closing argument. Uh attorney general keith ellison good to see you as always [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=295.04s)]
*  Thank you for joining us today. Keith ellison is the attorney general of minnesota [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifc0T777wmM&t=298.48s)]
