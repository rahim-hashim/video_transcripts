# Farkas: U.S. has wanted 'to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat', capabilities 'for a long time'
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA)
*  Evelyn, this is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, and that continues until sundown Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't know when they might do something, but it seems as though they are taking some [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  time to make some big decisions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=11.92s)]
*  What do you expect? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=13.72s)]
*  Do you think they'll go for military installations, energy, the oil fields, domestic or foreign, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=15.72s)]
*  and the nuclear? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=23.48s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=24.48s)]
*  Well, clearly, I would imagine behind the scenes our government and most of the Western [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=25.48s)]
*  governments are telling the Israelis not to strike any oil facilities because, of course, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  especially in the run-up to the U.S. elections, a strike at the oil facilities could result [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=37.96s)]
*  in some change in the oil and gas prices, which would not help us domestically. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=42.44s)]
*  So I think that that's one message that's probably being given to the Israelis. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=48.8s)]
*  What about nuclear? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=51.92s)]
*  Nuclear is... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=53.72s)]
*  We know publicly the president has said that he does not want the Israeli government to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=54.92s)]
*  strike the nuclear facilities, and the G7, he had our European and Japanese allies arrayed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=59.16s)]
*  with him on that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=65.28s)]
*  Frankly, I don't think that our government should be having those conversations publicly [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=66.76s)]
*  through the press. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=73.24s)]
*  Even the G7 should be muted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=74.24s)]
*  They shouldn't give their advice publicly to Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=76.6s)]
*  We've wanted for a long time, Andrea, you know this, to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=80.0s)]
*  the capability that they almost have to be a nuclear power. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  So if we could find some way to do that and limit, of course, the negative implications [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  of any attack, our government should be considering that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=96.96s)]
*  Let's just put it that way. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  In terms of when they might strike, I think the Israeli governments demonstrated that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=102.0s)]
*  they're very good at picking the right time and they don't let themselves be rushed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=106.36s)]
*  Frankly, even though it's a religious holiday and this is a government that's more religious [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=110.6s)]
*  in its constitution, more conservative, I also don't think that the National Security [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=116.28s)]
*  Establishment of Israel would let that impact them if they think that the moment is right [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=121.36s)]
*  now during the high holy holiday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=127.0s)]
*  In fact, one former official very close to the government told me there are more than [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=128.4s)]
*  600 daily laws that observant Jews are supposed to follow and that part of that is also that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=133.08s)]
*  in matters of life and death you can ignore the laws and they could do it, but whether [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=139.4s)]
*  they would do it is another whole question. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=144.84s)]
*  Regarding the nuclear issues, they could not take out the underground in the mountain, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  fordough, centrifuges without American help, without the bombs, the larger bombs, the larger [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=154.36s)]
*  planes that can carry bigger payloads. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=160.12s)]
*  So it's a question of whether the US would even be involved, not likely right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=164.12s)]
*  It doesn't appear likely, Andrea, and that might be another reason to delay. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, getting back to our domestic situation right now in the run up to the election, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=174.92s)]
*  if the Israelis want to be really patient, they can wait until after our elections, then maybe [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=179.88s)]
*  a Biden administration might even consider providing assistance to Israel in that scenario [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=185.24s)]
*  because right now I think for our administration, understandably, while of course they're putting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=190.52s)]
*  US national security interests first, they don't want to do anything politically to damage the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=197.0s)]
*  prospects for the vice president. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=202.68s)]
*  And NBC News has reported that Donald Trump talked to Netanyahu, we've called Netanyahu [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=204.84s)]
*  just last week, and what he has been publicly saying for quite some time, including at Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=213.24s)]
*  when the two met two months ago, Netanyahu was in the States, he said, go all in, get this over with. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=218.12s)]
*  So he's been ordering a maximalist approach. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=225.96s)]
*  Which is interesting because usually Donald Trump is the one to say, you know, no war and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=229.24s)]
*  don't do anything. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=233.72s)]
*  Former presidents don't usually get involved. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=235.96s)]
*  Well, and that's more than interesting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=237.88s)]
*  That's actually appalling that he's getting involved in the negotiations, mixing himself. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  And frankly, it's against the law. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  We've never applied, as you know, the law when it comes to the local who are not exactly people who [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  are not the lodge, lodge act, I think people who are not in government, not in an official capacity [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  are not allowed to interfere in, in, in foreign affairs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=260.36s)]
*  And clearly this, this is an interference when we also know that Donald Trump, when he was in office, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  was very hands off. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=270.2s)]
*  He allowed Netanyahu and the Israeli government to kind of do what they wanted when it came to, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=271.96s)]
*  frankly, the situation in the West Bank and the Palestinians, his government, Netanyahu's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=278.12s)]
*  government right now is against a two state solution, which frankly is against stability and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=282.92s)]
*  security for Israel, for the people of Israel, the Jewish people and the Palestinians. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think Donald Trump is going down a dangerous path, giving a carte blanche to Netanyahu. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwselHRFxA&t=293.32s)]
