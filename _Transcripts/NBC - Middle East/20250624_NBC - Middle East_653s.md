# 'Backwards': Top Dem on Trump's military strategy
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY)
*  From the congressional perspective, all of this is putting the cart before the horse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=0.0s)]
*  The Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=5.4s)]
*  The president is the commander in chief of the Army and Navy and the militias in times [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  of actual conflict, but that means he executes the will of Congress. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=13.98s)]
*  So this whole thing has been backwards from the beginning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=17.86s)]
*  Without getting into the merits of what happened, we've got to get back to regular constitutional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=21.2s)]
*  order. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=25.36s)]
*  Can I ask you about that, congressman? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=26.56s)]
*  Because I think it is understandably tempting to frame this question of constitutionality [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=28.14s)]
*  as it relates to war powers in terms of Donald Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=33.68s)]
*  But this headline from NBC News caught my attention. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=37.6s)]
*  I wanted to make sure you and I talked about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Presidents ordering military action without Congress' approval has become routine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=42.04s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=45.96s)]
*  Unlike tangible consequences, Trump has faced for other moves in which he tested the bounds [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=46.96s)]
*  of executive power, such as court rulings against him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=50.72s)]
*  Any price he might pay for this decision would largely play out in the American political [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=54.06s)]
*  arena and on the world stage where the U.S. reputation is on the line. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  As someone who thinks a lot about the Constitution, congressman, how much of what we are seeing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=62.36s)]
*  is the continuation of a pattern and how much of this is specific to Donald Trump? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  No, it is very much a continuation of a pattern, and part of it is executive usurpation of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=71.86s)]
*  power and part of it is frankly congressional surrender of its powers over the decades. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=80.14s)]
*  A lot of members of Congress say, well, look, let's not get involved in this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=86.56s)]
*  If it goes well, we can say we were with you the whole way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=91.38s)]
*  If it goes poorly, we can say it was the president's fault. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=93.62s)]
*  But that's an abdication of our proper constitutional assignment. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=97.3s)]
*  We have not just a right and a power to be the ones to declare war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=101.12s)]
*  We've got a responsibility and a duty to be the ones to debate all of the many factors [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=104.94s)]
*  and considerations that go into it, and not just on TV, but actually in the parliamentary [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=110.22s)]
*  context where we vote on it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=115.84s)]
*  General Fleck, you attended this forum today and the conversation now is sort of leveling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=118.14s)]
*  up this idea of, okay, we know this is unconstitutional, what this president is doing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=125.06s)]
*  I laid out a few of the things in the intro, but it's beyond just what we see with the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=131.32s)]
*  War Powers Act. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=137.2s)]
*  It's beyond what we see with the assault on the 14th Amendment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=138.2s)]
*  At the core of the anchor of all of this has been, and I talked about it in our last event, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  dealing with the humanity of individuals and using the government against them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=148.6s)]
*  You noted today the absurdity of Trump's administration's argument on citizenship executive order at [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=152.9s)]
*  the forum today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Can you make a quick listen to that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  To be arguing to the highest court in the land that a baby born in the United States' [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=164.4s)]
*  citizenship should turn on whether the attorney general of their state joined a lawsuit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  That was fundamentally what they were arguing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=179.28s)]
*  They weren't even contesting whether this is constitutional. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=180.74s)]
*  Well, in New Jersey, we are a small, dense state. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  A lot of mothers choose to cross the border into Philadelphia to give birth. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Is it really the position of the United States government, this is what we were asking, that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  that child's citizenship turns on whether that mother is at the supermarket when they [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=195.56s)]
*  go into labor across the river? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=201.6s)]
*  There it goes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=203.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=205.76s)]
*  I mean, so there is a complete storyline that is not just about the obvious stuff, but the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=206.76s)]
*  everyday stuff that impacts the humanity and the families and the communities of people [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=214.16s)]
*  out there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=218.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=219.12s)]
*  And I thank Representative Raskin and his colleagues in the House and the Senate for [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=220.12s)]
*  having us and lifting up this work. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=225.36s)]
*  Look, the rule of law, I think, has been talked about a lot. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=227.32s)]
*  And a lot of times it feels abstract, even to me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=230.68s)]
*  But it's not abstract. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=233.8s)]
*  When we're talking about that mother giving birth to a child in Philadelphia, not knowing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  if her son or daughter is going to be an American citizen, it's not abstract to parents of kids [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  with autism whose services were yanked away from them, or for people on Medicaid, or for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=243.64s)]
*  law enforcement, as has happened in New Jersey, who have been cut. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=247.76s)]
*  These are real harms. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=251.04s)]
*  And the reason why we have a rule of law is so that people can't be hurt arbitrarily based [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=252.04s)]
*  on the whims of a president, the way a king or a tyrant could do. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=257.32s)]
*  We as a nation came together and gave Representative Raskin and his colleagues the authority to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=260.68s)]
*  establish the laws. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=265.76s)]
*  And the president has a constitutional obligation to follow it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=267.12s)]
*  And when he doesn't, real people get hurt. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=270.44s)]
*  More forums, please. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=274.44s)]
*  We like the forums. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=276.24s)]
*  And I say that to say, a lot of the argument nowadays from folks, people say, oh, Simone, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=277.24s)]
*  you're being very critical. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=281.96s)]
*  You are always asking what the Democrats are doing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=282.96s)]
*  But I think the Democrats matter because in a government where we are talking about that, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=284.76s)]
*  as the general noted, we are a nation of laws, not men. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=289.76s)]
*  And in a government where we are a nation of laws and not men, I think the opposition [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=293.2s)]
*  party, the Democrats in this case, they should be standing up and asserting their constitutional [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  authority as a political branch of government. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=303.28s)]
*  Can we expect more forums such as these from not just you as the ranking member of your [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  committee, but from other committees that the Democrats have as well? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, as long as the senators are willing to share their rooms with us, because the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  House Republicans are very, very stingy about sharing the rooms. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=319.08s)]
*  And so Senator Durbin was very psyched to do this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  And it was great. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=326.32s)]
*  It was bicameral. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=327.32s)]
*  We had Democratic senators. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=329.0s)]
*  We had Democratic House members. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=330.17999999999995s)]
*  Of course, we couldn't get any Republicans to show up. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=331.76s)]
*  But we had the great attorneys general from Massachusetts and Jersey and Illinois and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=334.44s)]
*  who else was there? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=340.92s)]
*  And Minnesota, Keith Ellison, who was in Congress. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=342.92s)]
*  But they talked about being on the front lines of this struggle. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  The Democrats in the House basically don't have standing to go to court to challenge [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=350.88s)]
*  all of these things, because the courts have very restrictive standing doctrines when it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=355.28s)]
*  comes to members of Congress suing to just get the law enforced. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=359.6s)]
*  So we're piggybacking on them and we're filing amicus briefs alongside them and winning in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  a whole bunch of these cases. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  It's really impressive. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=372.04s)]
*  And we just won one from Maryland, Maryland versus Trump, about AmeriCorps. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=373.04s)]
*  They think they can just dismantle federal agencies, whether it's USAID, the Consumer [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=378.44s)]
*  Financial Production Bureau, or AmeriCorps. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=383.06s)]
*  And that's lots of young people's lives that they've poured into that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=386.46s)]
*  Lots of communities depend on it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  And the district court enjoined it, struck it down saying, no, you can't just shut it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=392.02s)]
*  down when Congress has set it up and Congress has funded it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=396.78s)]
*  And that's the basic structure of what we're talking about today. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=399.9s)]
*  The House passes legislation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=402.82s)]
*  The Senate passes legislation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  The president signs it into law. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=407.17999999999995s)]
*  And then the president changes his mind and says, I'm not going to enforce it when his [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=409.08s)]
*  job is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=412.78s)]
*  And so it reminded me of watching my kids one time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=416.78s)]
*  They were talking for like three hours about what kind of pizza to get. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=418.9s)]
*  And all the nieces and nephews were there and they decided, OK, we're going to get pepperoni [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=422.29999999999995s)]
*  pizza with pineapples. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=426.38s)]
*  But then the cousin that went to go pick it up changed it around and got hamburger and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=427.96s)]
*  sausages on it just because they were the ones to go get it when it had already been [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=432.94s)]
*  decided legislatively. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=436.53999999999996s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump keeps doing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  He circumvents the entire lawmaking democratic process and decides because he's the one who's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=440.12s)]
*  supposed to write the checks that he can just thwart the whole process. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=445.36s)]
*  I know Alicia's got a question, but just real quick, I want to say, why can't those other [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=448.88s)]
*  two cousins jack up the ones who got the sausage and the hamburger? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=452.72s)]
*  So the point is, the Congress should be able to jack up the president legally on this and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=458.6s)]
*  go into accordance that we wrote the law. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=463.52s)]
*  We know what the congressional intent was. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=466.12s)]
*  Why can't you do that? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=469.54s)]
*  Well, because the Republicans refuse to do it because they've completely surrendered [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=470.94s)]
*  and are invertebrate right now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  They will not stand up to Trump on anything. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=478.18s)]
*  And the courts won't allow us in as the minority party. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=480.18s)]
*  So we have no way in other than we have great public interest groups that are moving forward, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=483.82000000000005s)]
*  like Democracy Forward and State Democracy Defenders. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=490.06s)]
*  But the state attorneys general, these lawyers represent the people and the point that they're [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=493.94s)]
*  making and Keith Ellison made this today was, look, our representatives go to Congress past [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=499.02s)]
*  these laws. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=506.94s)]
*  That's for the people. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=508.46s)]
*  So we, the state, have an interest in seeing that the law will be enforced against a runaway [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=509.46s)]
*  president. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=514.86s)]
*  Congressman, you had Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling the president's decision [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=515.86s)]
*  to bomb Iran without authorization, a grave violation of the Constitution saying it is [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=520.26s)]
*  absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=525.3s)]
*  Congressman, just real quickly, do you agree? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=527.88s)]
*  I couldn't read the whole thing, but it sounds like I agree with that, that it's an absolute [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=531.16s)]
*  violation of the Constitution. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=534.56s)]
*  It's the grounds for impeachment piece that I want you to weigh in on. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=536.4s)]
*  It's right there at the end. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=539.32s)]
*  Well, without saying what anybody should do in any particular situation, undoubtedly a [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=541.48s)]
*  violation of the war powers of Congress, the usurpation of the war powers of Congress, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=546.84s)]
*  would be an impeachable offense, would be a high crime misdemeanor. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=552.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, Israel said we've just, in what Israel did on its own, we set them [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=555.8s)]
*  back two or three years. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=561.68s)]
*  So that's not an emergency. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=563.88s)]
*  Remember, the president can only assert the power to use military in a context in which [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=564.88s)]
*  there's an imminent threat to us. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=570.92s)]
*  And that clearly wasn't there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=573.92s)]
*  So we can add this to a very long list of things where the president has violated the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=575.66s)]
*  spending power. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=581.56s)]
*  The states brought an action because the president unilaterally imposed a spending freeze on [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=583.1199999999999s)]
*  laws passed by Congress, signed by the president, for a trillion dollars in spending. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=589.0s)]
*  They wanted to hold up all of these federal public health programs, housing programs, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  local policing programs, just out of the blue. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  Where does he get the doctrine that he can just do that? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=603.0s)]
*  He just pulls it out of a hat. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=605.4s)]
*  Well, the court struck it down, and gratefully, the states are there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=606.92s)]
*  But obviously, talk of impeachment today when we're in the minority and we can't even get [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=611.48s)]
*  Republicans to vote with us on a single bill to try to restore sanity is somewhat hypothetical. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=616.68s)]
*  But I'm with my friend AOC in saying we've got to keep a very strict catalog of all of [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=624.68s)]
*  the violations of the Constitution that are taking place. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBO6eMBfrY&t=630.04s)]
