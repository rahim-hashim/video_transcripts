# ‘So dangerous’: Rep. Crow slams Trump for contradicting intel assessment on Iran’s nuclear program
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM)
*  Joining us is Democratic Congressman from Colorado, Jason Crowe, a veteran who serves [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=0.0s)]
*  on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. Congressman, thanks for being here. What do you [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=4.4s)]
*  make of the lack of information Congress has received so far throughout this entire mission? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=8.72s)]
*  Well, Ana, it's both a lack of information and constant contradictions by the President himself [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=14.72s)]
*  and his top advisors who are saying different things depending upon which hour it is. And also, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=21.04s)]
*  I sit on the Intelligence Committee. I have seen battle damage assessments. And I was attacked this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=28.16s)]
*  morning on Twitter by the President's special advisor, Rick Grinnell, who has said that Congress [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=35.52s)]
*  hasn't seen the full battle damage assessments. So which is it? Are they hiding it? Are they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  withholding it from Congress? Or are they lying to us? So there is a lot of questions here, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=45.84s)]
*  and we're very short on answers right now. When you have the chance to ask questions at this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  briefing, what do you want to learn? Well, you know, I think the most important question here is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=55.92s)]
*  what is the actual strategy if there is one of this administration? You know, I was an Army [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=62.24s)]
*  Ranger and a paratrooper. I served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. I know that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=68.08s)]
*  America went to war for 20 years. We spent $3 trillion, over 6,000 American lives, lost [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=72.56s)]
*  credibility. Both of those wars turned out poorly by almost every measure. What are we doing here? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=79.52s)]
*  Is the President's strategy just every six months to a year bomb these facilities? Are we just going [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=86.32s)]
*  to drop bombs and we'll wait for Iran to rebuild and we'll drop bigger bombs and then they'll dig [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=92.88s)]
*  deeper and then we'll drop bigger bombs? Are we going to be caught in another Middle East quagmire? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=97.6s)]
*  Or are we going to actually have a diplomatic solution that's permanent and verifiable that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=102.96s)]
*  ensures that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon? Because that is actually the only way to do this, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=108.4s)]
*  not military bombing. You point out how once again it appears the White House is at odds with its own [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=113.12s)]
*  intelligence, which as we mentioned indicates Iran's nuclear program was set back only three [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=119.12s)]
*  to six months, not, quote, obliterated as the President and some members of his administration [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  have said. I know you've seen that initial assessment. I know you won't characterize it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=128.56s)]
*  because it's classified, but you touched on this. Can the American people trust the message [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=132.4s)]
*  from this administration? How do Americans learn the truth? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I take this point so seriously. When I was a paratrooper, I was sent to war in Iraq [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=143.6s)]
*  based on distortions and lies and politicized intelligence. So I get extremely upset when I [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=150.8s)]
*  have a president and people that are at the top of our national security infrastructure [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=158.88s)]
*  that are refuting and saying that our intelligence community is lying, that is distorting, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=163.68s)]
*  twisting the intelligence if it doesn't match their narrative, if it's not something that they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=169.92s)]
*  want to hear, or if it's refuting their political narrative. This is so dangerous, so dangerous, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  when a commander in chief is doing this, because when somebody talks tough in Washington, when [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=181.68s)]
*  Washington elites pound their chest and saber-rattle, it's not them that has to go off [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=186.72s)]
*  and do the fighting. It's working-class kids like me from upper Midwest, from the West, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=192.48s)]
*  from rural towns that they pick up rifles or get into planes and do the tough, dirty work. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=197.28s)]
*  This is very dangerous business. You have been in the shoes of our U.S. service members. What [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=202.16s)]
*  do you make of the administration turning any question about the strikes on Iran as [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=206.96s)]
*  disrespecting the troops? Well, it's antithetical to everything that I believe about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=211.84s)]
*  the role of civilian control of our military. You know, when I put on those boots and I picked [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=217.12s)]
*  up the rifle and I went to war, I needed to know that people were asking tough questions, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  that they were having debate, that we were being used wisely, that we had the equipment, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=227.04s)]
*  that we had the support, and that this was actually a mission that was important for America [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=231.44s)]
*  and not some political frolic. And by the president saying that, you know, questioning [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=236.56s)]
*  the use of the military, questioning him is the same as questioning the patriotism or the support [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=243.2s)]
*  of our troops. That is extremely dangerous rhetoric. My job as a member of Congress is to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=250.0s)]
*  ask tough questions. My job is to go and say, you know what, I am not going to send our young men [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=254.88s)]
*  and women someplace in the world and risk their lives unless it is absolutely necessary, and I'm [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=260.08s)]
*  never going to back down from that important, solemn duty. That job to ask tough questions, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=264.88s)]
*  I can relate to you there as well. Thank you, Jason Crowe, congressman from Colorado. I [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=270.48s)]
*  appreciate your time and we look forward to talking to you again soon, especially after that briefing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB970AH9FtM&t=275.6s)]
