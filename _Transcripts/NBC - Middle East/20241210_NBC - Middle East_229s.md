# What comes next for Syria? Rebel leader vows to pursue Assad regime officials
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0)
*  Joining us now, correspondent and executive producer of PBS Frontlines film The Jihadist, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=0.0s)]
*  Martin Smith. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=5.16s)]
*  Martin, it's really good to have you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=6.16s)]
*  You interviewed Al Jelani, who's the head of one of the rebel groups that came in and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=7.88s)]
*  took a lot of credit for ousting Bashar al-Assad, and is somebody that could be one of the next [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=12.76s)]
*  leaders or, if not one of the main leaders, of Syria. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=19.36s)]
*  Can you tell me who he is and what his motivations are? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=23.8s)]
*  He's got a very interesting history. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=27.92s)]
*  He was put on the terrorist list in 2013. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=30.48s)]
*  Prior to that, he was a young man who, after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, decided to go up [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=34.08s)]
*  and fight the Americans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=40.8s)]
*  And after not so long, he was put into an American prison camp that worked as something [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=42.88s)]
*  like a jihadi university. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  When he got out, he went to Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, and said, look, I want to fight [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=51.3s)]
*  in Syria. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  And he got Baghdadi to give him $60,000 to go across the border with six men and begin [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  to build an al-Qaeda faction in northern Syria. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=65.66s)]
*  I met him in 2021. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=70.18s)]
*  He was already in the process of rebranding himself. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=72.38s)]
*  He had broken, as Richard said in the previous segment, he had broken with al-Qaeda. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=77.06s)]
*  He had broken with Baghdadi. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=81.10000000000001s)]
*  In fact, when I was there, he was fighting. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=82.66s)]
*  He was having skirmishes with their cells that were around Idlib province. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=84.62s)]
*  So he struck me as serious. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=90.06s)]
*  I entered a room with a bunch of armed guards wearing ski masks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=92.98s)]
*  I was sat there for a few minutes, and in he walked, and we talked for many hours. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=96.98s)]
*  And I told him, look, I want to do an interview, and I want to ask you anything I want. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=102.86s)]
*  And you can say whatever you want. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=107.3s)]
*  So that was the beginning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=110.3s)]
*  A few days later, we were off in another undisclosed location and did a long interview with him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=112.14s)]
*  You know, you ask him about what he believes in and what sort of rule he would impose. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=118.14s)]
*  You talk to him about Sharia law. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=123.5s)]
*  He's done some interviews since, and correspondents have asked him about what the future holds [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=125.54s)]
*  and what sort of society he envisions for Syria. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=129.62s)]
*  I'm going to play the latest one. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=132.82s)]
*  This is from Sky News. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=134.18s)]
*  This interview that was done today, actually, with Jolani about what's going to happen next, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=135.3s)]
*  what Syria will look like. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=141.58s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=143.06s)]
*  Their fears are unnecessary, God willing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=146.3s)]
*  The country will be rebuilt. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  The fear was from the presence of the regime. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=150.46s)]
*  The country is moving towards development and reconstruction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=152.9s)]
*  It's going towards stability. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=156.18s)]
*  People are exhausted from war. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  So the country isn't ready for another one, and it's not going to get into another one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  The source of our fears was from the Iranian militias, Hezbollah and the regime, which [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=164.62s)]
*  committed the massacres we are seeing today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=169.06s)]
*  So their removal is the solution for Syria. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=172.22s)]
*  The current situation won't allow for a return to panic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=174.58s)]
*  All right, so he was being asked what's the message to foreign countries who are worried [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=179.62s)]
*  or concerned. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=183.9s)]
*  Do you find him believable? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=185.7s)]
*  Is he going to be somebody who's going to work with the West, perhaps try to stabilize [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=188.02s)]
*  the region, or are we in for another version of Syria from 10 years ago? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll turn that question around. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=199.5s)]
*  Will the West work with him? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=200.78s)]
*  Right now, he's being attacked by Israel, and it's unclear whether or not he can even [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=202.5s)]
*  assuage the various groups, minorities within Syria, the Alawites, the Kurds, Christians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=209.66000000000003s)]
*  and others. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=217.66000000000003s)]
*  So he's got his work cut out for him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=218.66000000000003s)]
*  If I had advice to him, I'd say he should quit now and turn over the control of Syria [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=220.34s)]
*  to your salvation government, as he calls it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqUh43hcLE0&t=225.7s)]
