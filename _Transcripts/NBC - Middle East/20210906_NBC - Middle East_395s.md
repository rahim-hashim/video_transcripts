# Ascend Founder Speaks Out About Young Girls Stuck In Afghanistan After Taliban Takeover
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0)
*  Can you give us a status update? Where do things stand at 1029 Eastern Time this morning on those planes and the evacuation? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, good morning to you too. And unfortunately there's not much to report. I was hoping that we would have something that shifted overnight and the day is basically over in Kabul. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=7.44s)]
*  And it's been a full seven days now and everyone's just still sitting there waiting for information, waiting to move and nothing's happening. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=17.12s)]
*  Are you getting any kind of communications from your people on those planes? Are they being told anything? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=25.76s)]
*  I was just texting them while I was waiting to come on with you, making sure nothing else happened. But no, nothing's happening. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=31.28s)]
*  We're in constant contact around the clock and they're holding steady. I mean, the girls are pretty tough and they know that everybody's out there pulling for them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=38.24s)]
*  But they're also really frustrated and confused as to why they're still sitting there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=47.84s)]
*  It's been a week and these are some of the same people who also were called to the airport for flights on which they were manifested but they weren't able to get into the airport. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  So this is day 10 and 11 for some people. And one of our people has a three-year-old son that's been hauled around on this experience. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  So yeah, we're pretty tired of it. And we're not privy to the overall picture so I'm not sure if it's purely about money or what exactly is at stake here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  But what we do know is that we have people who are women at risk and they can't go back and we've got to go. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=80.16s)]
*  You talked about some of the feelings of frustration, of confusion here. Do any of your people feel like they are in danger? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=90.8s)]
*  Yes, they're terrified. So just to be clear, nobody's sitting on planes. They haven't made it that far. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=98.88s)]
*  They're being held in facilities nearby waiting to get the call. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=105.76s)]
*  The facilities, it starts out reasonably okay but they're getting more and more crowded. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  The people who are supposed to be managing them are letting in extra people for a little bribe at the door. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  So they're filling up every day with more people who don't belong on the manifest. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  And my team is mostly teenage girls and we couldn't bring their whole families so we said you have to come alone. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=127.2s)]
*  So we've got teenage girls traveling without their families in this kind of crowded situation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=133.92s)]
*  So it's not safe at all. The Taliban have come into the facility a number of times and hauled people out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=139.28s)]
*  We're not sure exactly why but they're just right there exposed to whatever may happen. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=145.44s)]
*  To your knowledge, are there any kind of demands being made by the Taliban? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  Would you characterize it as a hostage situation or does that go too far based on the knowledge that you have right now? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=155.04s)]
*  I would not have chosen that word because nobody's forcing them to stay in a room. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=161.44s)]
*  If they wanted to, some of the girls have moved around the city for example to see how things are out there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=168.56s)]
*  But they're also scared they're putting on burkas which is absurd because these are girls who climb mountains and are professionals. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=175.12s)]
*  And they've never had a burka in their lives but that's what they have to do now to go see what's going on in the city. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=180.88s)]
*  So they've taken a peek and then scurried back in. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not safe and the way between Mazar and Kabul, these are not people from Mazar. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=189.6s)]
*  They've taken a very long trip to get there and the road along the way is fully controlled by the Taliban of course. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=194.08s)]
*  So going back home isn't really an option at this point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=199.12s)]
*  That's where we stand. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=204.56s)]
*  And I see you're working from home, Marina. So understandable with the noise in the background there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=207.12s)]
*  What is your hope as far as a timeline? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=210.72s)]
*  And have you heard anything from U.S. government officials that is giving you any optimism that this process will accelerate ASAP? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=212.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, we've heard nothing from U.S. government officials. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=220.88s)]
*  I wish we heard something. We don't have a line in to know what the U.S. government is or isn't doing on our behalf. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=224.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're just left confused and trying to comfort our people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=232.16s)]
*  And of course there are lots of kind of increasingly far-fetched ideas on how to get people out of this situation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=236.0s)]
*  We're trying to be patient and hope and trust that our government will pull some kind of levers with these people that they've been negotiating with for a very long time in Doha. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=242.16s)]
*  I feel like the relationships are there. There must be levers that can be pulled, but I don't have any insight into what might be done on our behalf. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  The most important thing, as you note, are the women and the girls, the teenage girls specifically, who are in Afghanistan right now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=260.32s)]
*  Your organization shared with us some audio of one of those Afghan girls, one of the athletes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=266.32s)]
*  I want to play a little bit for our viewers here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=271.52s)]
*  Our sufferings in the country are so great and a lot that we cannot express them in words. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  Afghanistan is the darkest and black place in the world for women and girls. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  We do not want our living to go down and I call on the world international and humanitarian community to help us [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  and not to forget the people of Afghanistan and the brave girls climbing mountains. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=299.6s)]
*  Those brave girls climbing mountains, people want to help. What is the most important thing that you need, Marina, right now in order to help these girls? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=306.56s)]
*  We need the U.S. government to leverage the relationships that it has with the Taliban via the Qataris, most likely, and get them to let our people go. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=315.36s)]
*  It's really that simple. And then we hope that they will be welcomed. We're trying hard to get visas so they have a legal path wherever they might land. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=326.4s)]
*  These are girls who will be an asset to any society. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=334.96s)]
*  So we're looking for visa options for them in our own country, but also in Ireland, in New Zealand, in Scotland. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=337.2s)]
*  And we hope that they'll be welcomed wherever they land after everything they've been through and they're ready to get started with the next phase of their lives. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  But first, we got to get out of there. We need intervention and we need it now. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=351.76s)]
*  And you'll know, right, Marina, I mean, you're in enough constant communication and constant contact that when something happens, you'll get alerted to it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=356.56s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, nobody's sleeping. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=363.76s)]
*  Nobody's sleeping and nobody's satisfied. Nothing's happening. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  So we're just in constant contact, hoping and looking at every little clue. But so far, nothing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=370.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZBWwliXb0&t=386.4s)]
