# 'Evil' was killed: IDF spokesperson speaks out on Hamas leader Sinwar's death
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk)
*  We have much more on the breaking news. The IDF and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasizing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=0.0s)]
*  their mission is not complete, in spite of the death of top Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=5.04s)]
*  Joining me now is IDF International spokesperson Major Doron Spielman. Major, thank you so [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  much for joining us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=16.56s)]
*  First of all, understandably, and President Biden just said this in a statement, that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=18.28s)]
*  he compares the relief that the people of Israel must feel to what the United States [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=24.04s)]
*  felt after Osama bin Laden was killed. Having said that, can you give us any details about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=29.5s)]
*  the operation that took down the mastermind behind October 7th? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=36.34s)]
*  Absolutely, Chris. Thank you for having me. And I think what President Biden said reaches [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=41.7s)]
*  to the very heart of the Israeli people. Again, Israel is a small country of 10 million people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=47.0s)]
*  Yaya Sinwar planned and perpetrated an attack that left 1,200 people, men, women and children, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=52.06s)]
*  dead. They were butchered. A hundred, 250 were brought back to Gaza. A hundred and one [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=59.38s)]
*  still remain there. There is not an Israeli family in this entire country that does not [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=64.62s)]
*  either have a family member that was affected or know of a close family member that was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  affected directly by this. And there is two emotions. One, as you mentioned, is a sense [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=75.18s)]
*  of relief and joy that such a mastermind of terror has reached justice at the same time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=80.38s)]
*  We know that we still have 101 hostages left and are facing a war on seven fronts. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=87.38s)]
*  As to how this went down, the Israeli IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, have been working [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=93.58s)]
*  with really sound intelligence over the last few weeks in terms of cornering Hamas chief [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=99.38s)]
*  terrorists that are in Gaza Strip in the Ra'afah area, eliminating their areas of movement [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=107.06s)]
*  and restricting the zones in which they can operate in. We knew that Yaya Sinwar was somewhere [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=112.9s)]
*  in the area along with other terror commanders, and we were hoping to force him to act like [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=117.9s)]
*  he was having to run from place to place like a fugitive. And in fact, that's exactly what [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=123.26s)]
*  happened. He was moving from tunnels to buildings back and forth, and we were hoping he would [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=129.22s)]
*  make a mistake. He made it earlier today. He and two other terrorists opened fire on Israeli troops. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=133.7s)]
*  Israeli troops returned fire also with a tank mortar shell. The mortar shell hit the building, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=140.73999999999998s)]
*  killing Yaya Sinwar and two other terrorists. After a period of time that we had to scope out [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=146.66s)]
*  the area and make sure there were no other terrorists, no other tunnels, that this was not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  a booby trap, this was not an ambush, our forces moved in to search the building and identified [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=156.26s)]
*  a body within the rubble that resembled Yaya Sinwar. It was in a setting that was very difficult [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=162.74s)]
*  to reach. We managed to remove DNA, send it for DNA evidence and dental records, and it was confirmed [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  that in fact one of the world's greatest terror mines, a sense of evil for the world, was in fact [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  killed today. He was the most wanted terrorist. Was it very clear or at least as clear as you can be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=181.94s)]
*  from a visual identification from the IDF who were there that this was indeed Yaya Sinwar? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=189.14s)]
*  Yes, the troops on the ground were surprised. When they moved in, they identified three bodies, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  and right away when they actually saw Yaya Sinwar and they saw the resemblance that he had, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=202.82s)]
*  they immediately alerted the intelligence authorities that they thought maybe this was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=209.61999999999998s)]
*  them. Again, we have to be very, very careful. He's been out of sight for more than a year. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=215.06s)]
*  Again, we have to remember the situation here. We haven't seen Yaya Sinwar in a year. He's been [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=219.38s)]
*  underground in tunnels. The only thing we have is a video that was taken from inside a tunnel, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=224.98s)]
*  looking at him walking by, so his appearance slightly changed. While the people of Gaza [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  had been suffering and had been moving two million of them from place to place, he has been [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=234.82s)]
*  underneath the ground, and so it took time to match that picture with the DNA evidence, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=239.7s)]
*  but we held our breath, and we hope, as the president said, as Kamala Harris said, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=244.18s)]
*  as leaders around the world are saying, that this can usher in a new era, an era that is going to be [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=249.38s)]
*  good for Israelis, good for the people of Gaza, and good for the world as a whole. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=254.18s)]
*  There is no doubt the challenge that faced the IDF in the 377 days since that attack. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=259.86s)]
*  As you rightly pointed out, he was in tunnels that are very difficult to penetrate, to navigate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=265.3s)]
*  He knows Gaza, knew Gaza extraordinarily well. There was no digital footprint. We know he wasn't [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=271.3s)]
*  using any digital technology, so when you say there was surprise, there was no expectation [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=277.7s)]
*  that, first of all, he would be there, and had you been able to in any way, even with [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=284.82s)]
*  no degree of certainty but some suspicion, that he was indeed moving between tunnels and buildings? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  We did have reports that he was on the run, that he was a fugitive, and our actions were, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=297.86s)]
*  if we couldn't identify him specifically, as you said, because of the challenge, he's not using [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=303.62s)]
*  phones, he's certainly not using pagers or any electronic device, he's only moving with a small [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=309.14s)]
*  number of people, almost no one knows where he was. Our strategy then said, okay, how can we use this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  in order to catch him? The only way to do it is to reduce an area of movement to a place that amongst [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=318.5s)]
*  terrorists, hopefully one of them is Yahya Asenwar, who will be forced to move so much from place to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=325.7s)]
*  place that he's bound to make a mistake. That is exactly what happened. They fired on Israeli troops, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=330.02s)]
*  alerting Israeli troops to the presence, which enabled us to return fire and kill him. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=336.02s)]
*  It was Yahya Asenwar's last mistake. So while we didn't know that he was in that building, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=340.98s)]
*  we knew he was in the area, and we hoped in every terror attack when you identified the bodies, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=345.94s)]
*  that you get to the Hitler, so to speak, of Gaza or the bin Laden of Gaza. And today we received the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  news that he was there, along with two other people that had been by his side since the beginning. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=356.74s)]
*  I have a couple of questions about the aftermath. We just heard from President Biden, via National [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=361.62s)]
*  Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the two of them are on air force run en route to Germany, and he [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=367.94s)]
*  said, this is the day after in Gaza, again, very much familiar to those who listened to Prime Minister [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  Netanyahu. He said, where Hamas is no longer in power or control, is that your understanding [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=379.86s)]
*  that anyone who is left in the leadership of Hamas is now outside of Gaza? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=387.54s)]
*  Look, the IDF has managed to take out most of Hamas' terror force. We have taken out now Yahya [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=394.74s)]
*  Asenwar, Mohammed Dieff is number two, Ismail Haniya in Beirut, which was the previous leader, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=401.38s)]
*  along with, of course, Hassan Nasrallah, and every one of these Hamas commanders or anyone who will [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  replace them knows that the IDF is going to reach them. There is a major shakedown in their [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=413.14s)]
*  leadership. To say at this point that Hamas is no longer functional, I hope that's the case, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  but certainly not something we can act on. We have to make sure, Chris, that the Hamas ideology [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=422.5s)]
*  is also taken care of, that anyone who might represent that ideology, who took place in the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=428.9s)]
*  October 7th attack, is also eliminated so that a new generation can rise. Maybe this is the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=432.98s)]
*  opportunity. Of course, I hope it is, although we still have two major goals regarding the day [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=439.14000000000004s)]
*  after. The first is to bring home our hostages, 101 of which are in Gaza, and the second is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=445.3s)]
*  Israel's facing a war right now on seven fronts. The mastermind of evil that stands behind this [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  war is Iran. We have caused damage to Iranian proxies. We have said that we will, in fact, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  return the gift that Iran sent us with the 181 ballistic missiles, of course, something [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=462.1s)]
*  facetious that they sent toward us, and that there will be an Israeli response. We have got [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=468.1s)]
*  to take care of right now the Iranian threat and the seven fronts of war, and maybe those around [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=473.06s)]
*  the area will look, will see the fate of these terrorists, how they reach justice, and will try [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=478.82000000000005s)]
*  to take a new path, a path that is good for Israel, good for the West, and good for the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=483.78000000000003s)]
*  other people of the Middle East. Major, I just spoke to the family of Israeli-American hostage [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=488.74s)]
*  Omer Nutra, who said that Sinemar's death makes this more dangerous for their son. In fact, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=494.5s)]
*  the way they said it was, it puts our family at greater risk. Do you agree with that? How does [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=499.54s)]
*  this change or impact in any way, strategy? First of all, my heart goes out to that family and the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=507.3s)]
*  other 101 hostage families. What they are living through is a roller coaster of hell. It has been [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=514.82s)]
*  going on now for over 370 days. The relatives are in dungeons underneath the ground, being held by [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=520.82s)]
*  Hamas in horrific conditions, and it is something that none of us even want to imagine. They have [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=527.3000000000001s)]
*  had ups and downs and hope and hopes crushed, and they know that the IDF is out to try to protect [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=532.98s)]
*  them. What I can tell you is this. Yahya Sinwar was the mastermind that took those people hostage [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  he ripped them from their homes and trained people to rip them from their homes. He held them as a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=544.98s)]
*  bargaining chip. He was completely against any type of deal that would allow them to go back home. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=549.94s)]
*  And as we've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu and the president and the vice president, we hope [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=556.1s)]
*  with him out of the way that this will encourage a change within Hamas. And this is the only action. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=562.34s)]
*  This is the only answer we know. There's no way to predict what it is because your enemy has a vote [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=567.46s)]
*  that will enable our hostages to come home safely. There's a chance. We need to do everything we can [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=572.02s)]
*  to make sure that happens. Major Doron Spellman, you've been very generous with your time. Thank [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=577.22s)]
*  you so much for being with us today. Thank you, Chris, for having me. I appreciate it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=581.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaeV_H9xohk&t=602.02s)]
