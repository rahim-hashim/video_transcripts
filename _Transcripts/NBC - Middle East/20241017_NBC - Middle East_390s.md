# 'Major step' towards release: Parents of hostage react to Hamas leader Sinwar's death
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk)
*  I want to bring in Ronan and Orno Nutra, parents of Orno Nutra, a dual Israeli-American citizen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=0.0s)]
*  who is still being held by Hamas. So, we spoke recently, and I just really want to ask to get [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=6.32s)]
*  your reaction to what you're hearing from Benjamin Netanyahu. He did say that Israel has its [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=17.36s)]
*  commitment, its supreme commitment, to bring the hostages home. But did you hear in that, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=25.6s)]
*  did you hear hope in that, that Israel has a plan to bring the hostages home that you think will work? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=32.72s)]
*  So, I think this is the strongest speech that we've heard from him relating to the hostages, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=42.24s)]
*  and I think that he's feeling the pressure that's coming from the hostage families. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=48.72s)]
*  You know, we're holding our breath. This is something that needed to happen, but it also [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=55.28s)]
*  puts our family members and our son at great risk, given greater risk than before right now in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=61.2s)]
*  chaos in Gaza. And our expectation is that the American administration and Israeli government [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=66.64s)]
*  do everything, be proactive right now, and act upon the release of the hostages immediately. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=74.0s)]
*  And he insinuated to a few things that could be done and reached out to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=80.64s)]
*  anyone holding onto hostages, but that's a first step, and we really need to see action immediately. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=86.48s)]
*  If I may add... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes, no, please. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=95.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=95.92s)]
*  No, please. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=96.4s)]
*  We've been hearing all along that Sinuari is the major obstacle for reaching a deal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=97.68s)]
*  Well, here we are. Sinuari was finally eliminated today. Israel has achieved most of its goals, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=103.36s)]
*  except one, releasing of the hostages. And we've heard from Netanyahu a commitment to release them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=111.36s)]
*  I think we're at an inflection point where everything should be done to release the 101 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=118.64s)]
*  hostages, among them seven Americans. The U.S. administration must do everything to support this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=123.52s)]
*  effort, together with the mediators in the area. And also, I want to remind the audience, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=129.6s)]
*  45 Americans were murdered on October 7. This is the time for the U.S. administration to step in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=137.12s)]
*  and say, enough is enough. Sinuari is gone. We're doing everything to bring the hostages. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=143.92s)]
*  Do you believe... [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=148.4s)]
*  Seven hostages. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you believe realistically, and you've had to become, over the last year plus, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=150.72s)]
*  experts on diplomacy, on international relations, on all sorts of things that no one should be put [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=155.36s)]
*  in a position to have to do. Do you believe there is an opening that that didn't exist before, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=162.08s)]
*  and that the U.S. has the influence to help move it in the direction of bringing your son home? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, the news cycle has been insane. We woke up this morning to this news [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=175.28s)]
*  that many people have been waiting for for a very long time. We have to look at something like this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=180.24s)]
*  as an opportunity, and we can't lose hope. And we're doing our share and pressuring all the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=185.44s)]
*  parties involved to take action right now, whether again, it's the United States government, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=192.24s)]
*  the Israeli government, the different mediators that have been around the table, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=197.04s)]
*  Hamas Doha, do whatever is needed and make this happen. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=201.44s)]
*  Omar was born here in New York. He's an American. It's the responsibility of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=206.4s)]
*  U.S. administration to do everything in its power to release the seven hostages, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=212.64s)]
*  and we look at the killing of Sinuart today as a major step toward this goal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=216.96s)]
*  Omar celebrated his second birthday in captivity this past Monday. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=222.88s)]
*  This has to end. He needs to be released together with the rest of the hostages. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=227.84s)]
*  And I think you were able, I've been following very closely your story, his story. You were able to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=232.96s)]
*  have a gathering of family, friends, supporters. I think it was on Sunday right on Long Island. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=238.96s)]
*  He was a basketball fan, if I remember from some other things I read in the past, a Knicks fan. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  And so you were able to have a gathering there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  I wonder what those conversations are like and how important they are, as exhausted as you must be, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=255.92s)]
*  to keeping that hope alive? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=263.12s)]
*  It was really a beautiful and emotional event. On Sunday in the city, actually, there was a big [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=267.36s)]
*  march in Central Park and then an event that was all around basketball. Omar always said, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=274.88s)]
*  basketball. He's a New York Knicks fan. And he played basketball. He captained his high school [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=282.8s)]
*  sports team. And many kids came, spoke about him in his honor, played for him. He was the only [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  person missing there. And we pray and hope that he's back soon and reunited with his friends, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=300.48s)]
*  with his family and so many people that are rooting for him and just praying for his release. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=307.44s)]
*  I don't know how often you're in touch with members of the administration, contacts [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=313.2s)]
*  with the U.S. government, and whether you've heard from them since this news broke. But [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=318.4s)]
*  when you do talk to someone, what will be your message? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=323.6s)]
*  Since the moment, we're expecting for a call with the White House. And we're going to tell them, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=327.92s)]
*  this is one of the greatest opportunities in the last year since Omar was kidnapped and the rest [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=334.64s)]
*  of the hostages. 377 days. Seize the moment. Come up with a plan and do everything possible [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=340.96s)]
*  with the partners in the Middle East to bring the hostages back. This is the time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=348.8s)]
*  Ronan Neutra, we hope that this is the opening that you and so many others, too many others, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  have been waiting for for 377 days. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=363.04s)]
*  I appreciate it so much. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsre-gURfwk&t=368.24s)]
