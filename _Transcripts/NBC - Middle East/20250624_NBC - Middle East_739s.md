# Will the ceasefire hold? Stakes are ‘enormous for Trump’s credibility’: Glasser
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo)
*  Joining me now is staff writer at The New Yorker, Susan Glasser, former California Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Jane Harman, and MSNBC contributor and columnist Charlie Sykes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=4.84s)]
*  Susan, I'll get to these individual leaders in just a second, but if I can ask you big [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=9.92s)]
*  picture, what are the stakes of this ceasefire holding right now? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=15.0s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=19.72s)]
*  I mean, I think you saw President Trump's very overheated outburst this morning, dropping [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  the bomb on live TV. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=28.24s)]
*  Why did he do that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=30.48s)]
*  He clearly understands that the stakes are enormous for his credibility, not only in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=32.04s)]
*  the region, but as he heads to a crucial summit meeting with all of the U.S.'s NATO allies [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=36.56s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=42.32s)]
*  This is a moment where Trump's decisions are being tested, also in question, unusually, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=43.56s)]
*  by many within his own MAGA political coalition. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  So I feel like the frayed nerves are representation of how very high the stakes are right now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=52.2s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Number two, of course, is beware the initial overheated claims. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Some of what we're hearing right now from Trump's defenders is really remarkable, considering [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=64.34s)]
*  we actually don't really know yet the results of these strikes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=68.44s)]
*  And they could lead to, let's hope they do, lead to a better outcome, an outcome with [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=73.44s)]
*  Iran no longer meaningfully able to pursue its nuclear program, but it could also lead [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=78.06s)]
*  to Iran doubling down on its nuclear program. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=82.9s)]
*  So I just feel like the stakes are enormous, but the results are not yet clear. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=90.58s)]
*  Congresswoman, let me start with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=91.58s)]
*  He's been a constant presence in Israeli politics since the 90s. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=93.62s)]
*  And I think certainly when you were on the Intel Committee and Homeland Security Intel [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=96.98s)]
*  Committee, he was around. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=101.9s)]
*  So what are you watching for from him and how he'll impact the future of the region? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=103.94s)]
*  Well, he's an amazing survivor. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=109.02s)]
*  Some claim that this invasion, timing of Iran, was his way to avoid a no-confidence vote. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=113.06s)]
*  And I think that may be true. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=121.62s)]
*  He was going to face an election soon, which some thought he would lose. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=123.82s)]
*  Now nationalism is rising in Israel and people are congratulating him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=128.5s)]
*  But this is very fragile. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=132.94s)]
*  Susan is right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=134.22s)]
*  And I'm on the more pessimistic side. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=135.26s)]
*  Negotiating is fine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=138.98s)]
*  President Trump, however, this morning used the F-bomb. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=139.98s)]
*  And negotiating is not a four-letter word. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=143.54s)]
*  In order to have this come out in a way that satisfies both sides and the U.S. so that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=146.96s)]
*  the fighting stays stopped is going to be very tricky because objectives are different. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=153.34s)]
*  The Iranians don't want to give up their nuclear capability. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=158.3s)]
*  They have the know-how. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=161.9s)]
*  I think they still have a lot of the materials. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=162.9s)]
*  And conversely, that's Israel's bottom line demand and Trump's. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  So how do you get to half of that or two-thirds of that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  So I'm watching carefully, but I don't think yet that the answer is clear. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think that Bibi Netanyahu dodged a bullet, but there may be more bullets, not literally, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=179.84s)]
*  but maybe even, I hope not, in his future because if he doesn't pull this off and if [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=185.96s)]
*  allegedly he's shooting people in Gaza and all these other problems are still there and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=191.78s)]
*  the hostages don't come home, the remaining ones who are alive, it's a huge problem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=197.34s)]
*  Susan, let's talk about another unclear answer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=202.22s)]
*  OK, so we know that in Iran, the Ayatollah, who was 86, has gone into hiding with his [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=204.94s)]
*  family. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=211.14s)]
*  The regime change question is being argued. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=212.14s)]
*  For some, it's a question of whether he's taken out by political forces or assassination. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=216.58s)]
*  Reports are he's had a three-man committee working on his potential replacement. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  What are the chances that he survives this conflict and if he does not, that something [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  better would be put in his place? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=233.58s)]
*  Well, first of all, look, when you have an 86-year-old leader in a very opposite of opaque, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  a very opaque regime inside Iran, the answer is that we don't know an awful lot. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  But remember that the outcome here is not just either the status quo or some kind of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  liberal democracy that materializes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=253.78s)]
*  And unfortunately, the story of the last few decades in world politics is that many times [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=255.94s)]
*  the turnover in power leads to potentially an even worse outcome, not only chaos and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=263.82s)]
*  instability being a possibility when a government that has essentially run around since 1979, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=269.18s)]
*  if that were to fall, it's very possible that the people with the money and guns to be blunt [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  in that society may acquire more power. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=281.5s)]
*  In the short term, I think there are reliable reports. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=283.94s)]
*  You look at some of the commentary from my friend, the excellent Kareem Sajjapur from [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=287.22s)]
*  the Carnegie Endowment, and he has pointed out, I think very correctly, that in the short [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  term, the voices of the people who were urging negotiations with Donald Trump and with the West [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=297.5s)]
*  are undercut by this war that Netanyahu has launched and Trump's decision to join in on it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=303.58s)]
*  So in the short term, at least, it's very likely to me that the moderates may be undercut [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=309.02s)]
*  inside the Iranian government circles and that the hardliners, at least for now, might [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  emerge with somewhat more power. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=320.62s)]
*  But again, you know, that's part of what makes engaging in a war so very unpredictable. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=322.06s)]
*  We don't know right now if it's a great triumph or not. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And Congresswoman, let me go back to something Susan said earlier, which is the final battle [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=330.54s)]
*  damage assessment is still not finished. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=335.1s)]
*  We don't know what Iran's capabilities are. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  How much of the outcome of all of this do you think may ultimately be, if not decided, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=341.06s)]
*  heavily influenced by that intelligence and how it informs all three leaders? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=346.38s)]
*  And I guess potentially impacts them politically. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=351.42s)]
*  Well, let's start with the fact that obliterated, which was the word that the Secretary of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=354.86s)]
*  Defense and President Trump used, is not a military term. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=359.1s)]
*  And for sure, everything was not obliterate. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=363.18s)]
*  The Iranians continue to possess the knowhow. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=366.58s)]
*  And there are reports that private commercial satellites took pictures of what seemed to be [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=369.18s)]
*  allegedly some of the material taken out of Fordow three days ahead and then some mud [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=376.82s)]
*  put in the entrance to Fordow. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=384.82s)]
*  So this was telegraphed in obvious ways. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=386.46s)]
*  And the Iranians are smart cookies and they prepare. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=389.58s)]
*  But in addition to that, there may be other facilities that we don't know about. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=392.98s)]
*  There certainly it's not just highly enriched uranium that we care about. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=397.18s)]
*  We also care about the machinery to make bombs that could be somewhere else. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=401.46s)]
*  It also could be gettable from rogue states like North Korea. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=405.22s)]
*  North Korea is teaching Iran that if you have nukes, you survive. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=409.58s)]
*  Let's remember, Ukraine gave up its nukes in 1994 in exchange for a promise from the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=414.02s)]
*  Russians and others to respect its sovereignty. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  And look where it is. So I think we have to assume that it ain't over till it's over. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=422.66s)]
*  And it probably ain't over in terms of Ukraine, Iran possessing the capability to break out [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=428.70000000000005s)]
*  a nuclear bomb. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=436.66s)]
*  And Charlie, of course, the third leader, but arguably the most influential in all this, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=438.42s)]
*  President Trump, his involvement in Iran comes in direct opposition to his long stated [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  America First agenda and of course, what he campaigned on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  And I was the only president in decades who didn't start a war. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=453.98s)]
*  Instead, I got us out of wars and endless wars. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=457.66s)]
*  I will put America first every single time, every single day. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=460.58000000000004s)]
*  You don't want to have wars. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=465.18s)]
*  I ended wars. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=467.66s)]
*  I call it America first. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=468.66s)]
*  This is the policy that built this country and this is the policy that will save our [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=471.18s)]
*  country. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=475.86s)]
*  They said he will start a war. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=476.86s)]
*  I'm not going to start a war. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=478.22s)]
*  I'm going to stop wars. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=479.22s)]
*  His supporters will argue that that's exactly what he just did, was stop a war. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=480.22s)]
*  Is America first dead? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=485.94000000000005s)]
*  Is MAGA reimagined? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  How do you see all this? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=490.42s)]
*  Well, MAGA is Donald Trump, and I think we're seeing that playing out in real time, that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  in fact they are lining up behind him. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=497.82000000000005s)]
*  But, you know, Donald Trump has been railing against these endless wars for decades. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=500.86s)]
*  What he's hoping for is this is one and done, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=506.62s)]
*  You could see that with the tension and the stress this morning when he's dropping the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=509.42s)]
*  F-bomb. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=513.02s)]
*  But the problem with the Middle East is that none of these problems are easily solved, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=514.02s)]
*  you know, and the discussion has been excellent so far. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=518.22s)]
*  You know, we are still in a very, very, you know, we are in early days. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=521.02s)]
*  The outcome is unpredictable. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=525.02s)]
*  The instability in the Middle East, I think, has been accelerated. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=527.42s)]
*  And the question is, does Donald Trump actually understand or know what he has unleashed? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=533.02s)]
*  I think there's a tendency sometimes to see these things in terms of news cycles. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=539.42s)]
*  We're on day three. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=543.42s)]
*  Many of the players in the Middle East will look at this in terms of decades. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=545.42s)]
*  They will take the long term. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=550.22s)]
*  And, you know, what will happen with Iran and how many other countries are watching [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=552.22s)]
*  this and realizing, you know what, this is the reason why we're not going to be able [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=556.22s)]
*  This is the reason why we need to have nuclear weapons. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  This is the reason why we cannot be vulnerable anymore. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=565.02s)]
*  So I'm looking at this in terms of the long term nuclear proliferation, because anyone [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  who thinks that Donald Trump has just simply been the executive producer of a 48-hour Trump [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=575.42s)]
*  show in the Middle East, I think, is incredibly naive. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=581.8199999999999s)]
*  I think it was one of your colleagues, Susan, at the New Yorker, who recently wrote about [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=584.62s)]
*  Donald Trump and his patience. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=590.22s)]
*  He's not been known for it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=592.22s)]
*  All you have to do is look back to his campaign once again, where he said he was going to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=594.22s)]
*  solve all these problems in 24 hours, or maybe even before he took office. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=598.22s)]
*  He's come up against the reality of how complex the world really is. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=603.02s)]
*  But how much does patience play into this, Susan? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=608.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Charlie is absolutely right to spotlight this as sort of a contest between [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=612.22s)]
*  the kind of 24-hour news cycle version of producing the presidency, which is often how [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=617.42s)]
*  Donald Trump looks at it, and the actual long-term challenges that any president, Democrat, or [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=624.2199999999999s)]
*  Republican would face. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=630.38s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about literally a generation of American presidents. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=631.42s)]
*  All of America's Cold War presidents, from Bill Clinton on, have been absolutely obsessed [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=636.2199999999999s)]
*  with this question of Iran and its possibility to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=641.9s)]
*  This is an issue that was keeping Bill Clinton up at night, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=647.42s)]
*  of course, negotiated the nuclear deal that Donald Trump withdrew from. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=653.5s)]
*  And this, I think, is a great answer to your question. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=656.78s)]
*  Back in 2018, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, although our own intelligence [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=660.14s)]
*  estimates did not find that Iran was not in compliance with it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=666.86s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump's own defense secretary and secretary of state at the time argued [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=670.7s)]
*  for the United States to stay into that nuclear deal. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=674.94s)]
*  You could say that while Donald Trump might have impulsively decided to join in this Israeli [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=677.4200000000001s)]
*  campaign after Netanyahu launched it a couple of weeks ago, that in reality, some version [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=683.1s)]
*  of this conflict was made inevitable by the decision that Donald Trump took back in 2018. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=688.86s)]
*  And I just think that's a great example of—I look at a lot of the coverage today, and it's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=694.22s)]
*  hysterical. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=699.6600000000001s)]
*  It is literally breathless, without any context, without any history. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=700.54s)]
*  Donald Trump already has a long history of dealing with this issue, and I think that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=706.06s)]
*  it's his own action that in many ways that were a precursor to the inevitability of the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=710.4599999999999s)]
*  strike that we are seeing over the last few days. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnVxHsnfyo&t=716.06s)]
