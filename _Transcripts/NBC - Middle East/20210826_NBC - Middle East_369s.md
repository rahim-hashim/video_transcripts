# Biden To ISIS: 'We Will Not Forgive, We Will Not Forget'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M)
*  Here's the latest on what we know tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=0.0s)]
*  Two suicide bombers detonated themselves in Kabul. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=2.56s)]
*  This was earlier today, and the death toll is high. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=5.0s)]
*  Twelve U.S. service members, 15 other American service members wounded, according to the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  information we have at this hour. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=12.94s)]
*  Many Afghans were also killed, but based on the security situation, we don't have an exact [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=15.16s)]
*  number on that at this moment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=20.12s)]
*  The first explosion was at Abbey Gate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=22.48s)]
*  That's outside the airport in Kabul, and it was followed by gunmen opening fire on both [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=24.04s)]
*  civilian and military targets. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=27.44s)]
*  Now, late today, ISIS formally claimed responsibility. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=29.72s)]
*  Thousands of people have been gathering over the last two weeks in these areas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=33.56s)]
*  So it was well known on the ground about these choke points, and many people were seeking [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=37.08s)]
*  any type of evacuation, getting any flight out of the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=41.72s)]
*  The second blast at the Baron Hotel was walking distance from this airport. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=45.08s)]
*  That's also what has become a key gathering place for evacuees. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  That includes Americans, includes individuals who may be cleared to go on others gathering [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=52.24s)]
*  at some distance who are trying to go. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=56.84s)]
*  Now, the president just spoke out in very stark and at times emotional terms. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=59.04s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what the president just said. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=64.08s)]
*  To those who carried out this attack. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=69.24s)]
*  As well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=73.8s)]
*  We will not forgive. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=77.84s)]
*  We will not forget. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  We will hunt you down and make you pay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=84.48s)]
*  The president making his view on this clear and really trying to cover two bases, as [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=89.64s)]
*  Brian Williams was just covering in that address, because President Biden was both honoring [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  what he called the heroes who just died trying to save other people's lives, while also [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=99.28s)]
*  standing resolute on his withdrawal policy, saying this danger, this death is part of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=105.6s)]
*  at least the possible risk equation that the United States had undertaken. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=111.44s)]
*  Now, hospital in Kabul reporting 60 people injured, that includes children. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=115.44s)]
*  The number, though, is expected to rise. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=118.76s)]
*  As mentioned, the reporting here has been fluid in what has been a terrible emergency [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=120.44s)]
*  situation on the ground. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=124.48s)]
*  The Pentagon referred to this as a, quote, complex attack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  And the Pentagon is stating that they do believe it to be carried out by ISIS, something the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=129.44s)]
*  president also mentioned in his remarks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Officials, though, are working on a full confirmation attribution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=135.4s)]
*  United States continue the evacuation mission as the threat of further attacks does remain [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=139.16s)]
*  very vivid and an August 31st self-imposed deadline closing in. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=143.24s)]
*  We bring in our experts now. We have a former senior adviser to the Secretary of Defense, Ash [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=147.92s)]
*  Carter, who is Mark Jacobson, who advised Mr. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=151.84s)]
*  Carter, as well as a longtime Washington correspondent, Cady Kay. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=154.04s)]
*  Mr. Carter, your view of, excuse me, I should say, Mr. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=158.76s)]
*  Jacobson, your view of what it means that this is a security situation on the ground [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=163.4s)]
*  and what, if anything, you make of the president's remarks today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  All right, thanks, Ari. What's happening is a complicated situation is getting even more [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=173.64s)]
*  complicated with the president's policy that we're going to do this evacuation and be up by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=178.68s)]
*  the 31st. You have to balance security, which means it's going to slow things down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=183.44s)]
*  How many we can bring in through the gate, how many we can get on the airplanes with the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  need to bring in thousands more Afghans who served side by side with American troops and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=192.48s)]
*  are literally sitting outside the gates now, waiting to get in. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=198.0s)]
*  And they haven't gotten in yet. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=201.56s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is the Taliban have been slowing the process down, which is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=203.16s)]
*  something the president had said they wouldn't do. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=207.36s)]
*  They're taking Afghan passport holders and not letting them come with their spouses and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=210.0s)]
*  immediate family who are U.S. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=215.24s)]
*  passport holders. We still have American passport holders on the ground. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=217.0s)]
*  I don't see how we do this before the 31st. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=220.88s)]
*  So the dilemma for the president is this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=224.36s)]
*  If he is going to be committed to getting Americans out, want to get out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=226.52s)]
*  If he's going to be committed to getting Afghan Afghans out who served with us and he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  promised they would have a home in America, there's either going to have to be an [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=236.28s)]
*  extension or we're going to have to change the way we're doing things down there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  We can't have days where there are charter humanitarian charter flights going out empty. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  We can't have situations where American families are split up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=250.0s)]
*  They have to come home and come home. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=253.2s)]
*  That's there was a bit of a false choice, I think he presented by saying, well, if [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=255.64s)]
*  an American citizen decides that they're going to stay back because their family can't [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=260.92s)]
*  come, then they're somebody who chose to stay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  That that's not right. That that's absolutely not right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  And, Katty, I want to draw a little more attention to what the president just laid out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=274.32s)]
*  Some may have seen it, but it was a tough time to address the nation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=278.0s)]
*  Certainly the largest death toll and foreign policy crisis this president has faced. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=282.16s)]
*  And we are awaiting, as people can see on the screen, the briefing, which we'll bring [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=286.72s)]
*  from the White House when it happens. President Biden spoke about the service members killed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=289.6s)]
*  and talked about getting others out of harm's way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=294.36s)]
*  These American service members who gave their lives. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=303.04s)]
*  It's an overused word, but it's totally appropriate here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=307.76s)]
*  We're heroes. They're a part of the bravest, most capable, the most selfless military in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=310.2s)]
*  the face of the earth. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=314.84s)]
*  And they're part of simply what I call the backbone of America. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=316.0s)]
*  Katty, your view of what we heard from the president. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, obviously, in that respect, the president is also speaking from personal experience. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=328.2s)]
*  He mentioned his son who had served in Iraq and how he he has that capacity as the father [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  of a U.S. service member to empathize, perhaps in a way that many presidents haven't [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  with the families of those service members who have died so tragically in Afghanistan today. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbsEqDNd-M&t=343.52s)]
