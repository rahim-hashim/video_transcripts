# Netanyahu is ‘absolutely wedded’ to continuing the war against Hamas, Hezbollah: Fmr. Ambassador
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q)
*  Ambassador, earlier today in Berlin, President Biden spoke about Sinwar's death and the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=0.0s)]
*  conversation he had with Prime Minister Netanyahu about what comes next. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=5.68s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=9.52s)]
*  The death of leader Hamas represents a moment of justice. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=10.52s)]
*  He had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=15.56s)]
*  on his hands. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=20.32s)]
*  I told the Prime Minister of Israel yesterday, let's also make this moment an opportunity [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=21.8s)]
*  to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=28.84s)]
*  President Biden sending Secretary of State Blinken to the Middle East once again to soon [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=34.88s)]
*  restart the ceasefire and the hostage talks with Israel, Egypt and Qatar. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  How can diplomats seize this moment? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=43.58s)]
*  Well, this is a continuation in the aftermath of Sinwar's death now of the Biden administration's, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=47.64s)]
*  if you will, two-pronged policy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=56.44s)]
*  One to get a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of the Israeli hostages, and then to try to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=59.64s)]
*  stabilize Gaza in the long term and then on the Lebanese front to enact UN Security Council [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=65.2s)]
*  Resolution 1701, which would require his bullet to withdraw to the Lattali River, et cetera. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=71.58s)]
*  The problem is that neither Hamas, as your correspondent very accurately reported from, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=78.08s)]
*  is that they're sticking in the aftermath of Sinwar's death to their hardline positions [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=85.96s)]
*  across the board. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=90.88s)]
*  The withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza, the release of all Palestinian prisoners, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=92.82s)]
*  no hostage releases unless a political accommodation is made, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=99.36s)]
*  And on the northern front, Hezbollah is also digging in on its hardline positions despite [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=105.16s)]
*  the very effective Israeli decapitation of leaders on both fronts, Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=112.26s)]
*  The Israelis and Netanyahu's policy is basically to reestablish Israeli deterrence after the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=121.42s)]
*  horrible failure of Israeli security establishment on October 7th. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=128.46s)]
*  So what he's doing now, I think he is absolutely wedded to continuing the war, continuing fighting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=134.3s)]
*  establishing what his military seems to want is some presence in the Netanyahu corridor [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=142.62s)]
*  to keep northern Gaza free of Hamas terrorists to secure the southern border of Israel and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=149.9s)]
*  Hezbollah to drive Hezbollah back in its military operations, Israel's military operations, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=158.54s)]
*  certainly north of the border with Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=165.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=168.06s)]
*  It's going to continue. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=168.66s)]
*  And your earlier coverage of the American elections, the U.S. elections, I think is very telling. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=170.54s)]
*  Everyone is looking over the shoulders of Biden, the Biden administration to see who the next [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=178.3s)]
*  president of the United States is going to be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=183.1s)]
*  There's a political void here until we know who the next president is. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=185.18s)]
*  And I think Netanyahu is hoping for a Trump victory because he thinks he probably could [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=189.74s)]
*  get more of a green light from Trump than he could from Kamala Harris. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=196.54s)]
*  So all of this means is that we're in for continued volatile situation in the near term [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  without anyone talking about anyone looking at a strategy for the longer term. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=208.78s)]
*  Former Ambassador Edward Deregin, thank you very much for taking the time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=215.98s)]
*  We appreciate your insights and expertise. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=219.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=can8iUR_23Q&t=226.54s)]
