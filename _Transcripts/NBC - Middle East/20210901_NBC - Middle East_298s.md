# Secy. Austin On Afghanistan: 'America's Longest War Has Come To A Close'
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU)
*  We have concluded our historic evacuation operation and ended the last mission of the U.S. War in Afghanistan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=0.0s)]
*  America's longest war has come to a close. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=12.0s)]
*  Now, both as Secretary and as a veteran of our Afghan war, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=16.0s)]
*  my thoughts have been with the brave Americans who stood up to serve after al-Qaeda attacked us on September 11, 2001. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=22.0s)]
*  And my heart is with their families and loved ones and with our friends and allies [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=34.0s)]
*  and with our fellow citizens whose lives were lost or changed forever over 20 years of war. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=43.0s)]
*  We remember 2,461 American service members and personnel who paid the ultimate price in this war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=52.0s)]
*  And more than 20,000 wounded Americans, some still carrying the scars that you can't see on the outside. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=63.0s)]
*  We also remember the thousands of American contractors who lost their lives, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=72.0s)]
*  and hundreds of our allies and partners from NATO and beyond, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=78.0s)]
*  and tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers and police officers, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=83.0s)]
*  and tens of thousands more Afghan civilians. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=89.0s)]
*  Now, we have just concluded the largest air evacuation of civilians in American history. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=96.0s)]
*  It was heroic. It was historic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=103.0s)]
*  And I hope that all Americans will unite to thank our service members for their courage and their compassion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=109.0s)]
*  They were operating in an immensely dangerous and dynamic environment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=117.0s)]
*  But our troops were tireless, fearless, and selfless. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=124.0s)]
*  Our commanders never flinched, and our allies and partners were extraordinary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=132.0s)]
*  The United States evacuated some 6,000 American citizens and a total of more than 124,000 civilians. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=140.0s)]
*  And we did it all in the midst of a pandemic and in the face of grave and growing threats. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=150.0s)]
*  I am incredibly proud of those who made it happen, and they made it happen with grit and skill and humanity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=157.0s)]
*  Our outstanding men and women showed steady judgment under crushing pressure, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=167.0s)]
*  including some very young service members who summoned up exceptional courage at close quarters. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=173.0s)]
*  They ran an international airport. They sped up visas. They fed the hungry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=182.0s)]
*  They comforted the desperate. And they got plane after plane after plane into the sky. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=191.0s)]
*  Our forces risked their own lives to save the lives of others. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=202.0s)]
*  And 13 of our very best paid the ultimate price. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=209.0s)]
*  And many of them were too young to personally remember the 9-11 attacks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=218.0s)]
*  The United States military will always honor their heroism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=225.0s)]
*  We mourn with their families, and we owe them support through the days and years ahead. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=233.0s)]
*  It is noteworthy that on the day of the attack at the airport, our troops and their partners pushed hard and carry on, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=243.0s)]
*  putting 89 rescue flights in the air in the span of 24 hours and lifting 12,500 souls to freedom. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=253.0s)]
*  It has been an enormous achievement, not just by the U.S. military, but also by the militaries of our allies and partners, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=265.0s)]
*  and of course, by our teammates at the State Department. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=274.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC5tm-dPduU&t=283.0s)]
