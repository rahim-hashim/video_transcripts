# Missiles fired at U.S. bases in Qatar
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU)
*  Let me bring in MSNBC military analyst, retired Colonel Jack Jacobs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=0.0s)]
*  Jack, this was a question. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=4.12s)]
*  What would Iran consider to retaliate for the massive attack that was launched by the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=5.8s)]
*  end, unprecedented attack launched by the U.S.? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=12.52s)]
*  Again, we're getting this from Iranian state TV, but we have three new pieces of information [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=15.44s)]
*  that I want to get your reaction to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  One is this attack. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  The second is that sirens are sounding not just at that base, but in Bahrain and Kuwait [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=24.22s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=29.6s)]
*  And you have the president, defense secretary, and other key members of the administration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=30.6s)]
*  in the Situation Room. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=34.64s)]
*  Well, the report was that there were half a dozen missiles, and we don't know how accurate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=36.0s)]
*  that is. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=41.04s)]
*  But clearly, if you wanted an off-ramp, to use the old tried expression, and you were [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=42.68s)]
*  Iran, you'd fire a bunch of missiles and be done with it and hope that that was going [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  to be the end of it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=53.08s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like that's the case. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=54.46s)]
*  One report was that they were headed towards our air base in Qatar, where, by the way, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=57.48s)]
*  we had 10,000 troops thereabouts. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=63.08s)]
*  For a position of U.S. Central Command, 10,000 troops. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=67.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=70.6s)]
*  A likely target. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=71.6s)]
*  But if sirens are also being heard in Bahrain and Kuwait, we have naval forces stretch all [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=73.5s)]
*  across the Middle East as well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=81.96s)]
*  It may mean that there are other missiles, which means that Iran has decided that it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=84.64s)]
*  not necessarily looking for a way to get out of this problem, but in fact are raising mistakes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  The trouble for Iran is that it's kind of stuck. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=99.2s)]
*  It's got to do something, it thinks, in order to demonstrate that it's not weak. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=102.32s)]
*  Don't forget, it's got a domestic audience as well, not the people, but the Republican [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=108.32s)]
*  guards, who in many respects may in fact be lots less progressive even than the mullahs, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=113.36s)]
*  on the one hand, and the rest of the world also, though it's the domestic audience that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=121.16s)]
*  they've got to be most concerned about. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=126.08s)]
*  And second, to make sure that the United States understands that it's really, it's capable [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=129.36s)]
*  of responding to preclude further Western attacks, but if it really ups the ante by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=134.16s)]
*  killing American troops, by sending multiple attacks out there in multiple places, that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=141.5s)]
*  also by the way damage people like the Qataris who are acting as intermediaries, then in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=148.18s)]
*  fact all bets are off, and the likelihood of an American response that the Iranians [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=155.18s)]
*  did not anticipate, something really, really big, becomes greater. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=163.62s)]
*  The Iranians are looking at the United States and come to the conclusion that the guy who's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=169.62s)]
*  got his finger on the button is unpredictable. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=172.74s)]
*  Well if you're looking at somebody who's an adversary who's unpredictable, what you probably [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=176.74s)]
*  don't want to do is make them angry. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=181.22000000000003s)]
*  And it depends on how long this attack is going to be, how widespread it's going to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  be, and whether or not it's going to stop after this attack. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  But if a lot of American troops are hurt, then all bets are off. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  There is an Iranian semi-official news agency, Tasnim, they are saying that Iran has launched [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=198.36s)]
*  missile operations, what is called Basharat al-Fath, against US bases in Qatar and Iraq. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=203.84s)]
*  This basically translates to glad tidings of victory. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=211.28s)]
*  The operation code phrase is Ya'aba Abdullah, which is a reference to Imam Hussein. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=216.0s)]
*  So when you talk about messaging and the importance of the domestic audience that the Ayatollah [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=221.8s)]
*  and the people around him are most concerned about, just the name of it will tell you something. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=227.4s)]
*  But let's consider more specifically the dangers here of escalation because what the message [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=233.0s)]
*  was from supporters of the president, this was going to potentially just shut it down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=240.96s)]
*  This is not shutting it down. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=246.84s)]
*  Well they keep talking about, the administration keeps talking about this being a war against [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=249.44s)]
*  the nuclear capability of Iran. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=253.36s)]
*  And of course that's where the attacks were. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=256.04s)]
*  By the way, as a side... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=259.36s)]
*  Let me stop you for just a second because Courtney Qubee, who is our reporter at the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=261.0s)]
*  Pentagon, has gotten in front of the camera now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  Talk to us about what we know about these bases, and very importantly, we've heard a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=268.44s)]
*  lot over the last 36 hours or so about the defenses that are in place. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  So tell us about that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=279.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=280.76s)]
*  So one of the main bases that we're talking about here is Al-Yadid. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=281.76s)]
*  That's in Doha. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=285.24s)]
*  It's this sprawling, enormous air base that is actually owned by the Qataris, but the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=286.24s)]
*  U.S. military has been there with thousands of troops operating off that base, largely [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  airmen, for years now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=296.88s)]
*  Now it does have extensive air defense systems, and that's both ground-based systems, which [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  you've been hearing a lot about in recent days that have the ability to shoot down not [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=304.32s)]
*  only incoming missiles, but also drones. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=308.28s)]
*  But they also have multiple fighter squadrons there, fighter jets, that have the ability [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=311.55999999999995s)]
*  to go up in the air and shoot down incoming as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=316.78s)]
*  We've seen them do that in recent... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  Just frankly, in recent months, U.S. aircraft up shooting down incoming drones, and they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=321.52s)]
*  can even take down certain missiles, Chris. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=325.88s)]
*  So that is the defense that they have on the base. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=328.32s)]
*  That is, as I said, an enormous, sprawling base right in Qatar. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=330.76s)]
*  But there are other U.S. military installations that also are in the area that are well within [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=336.02s)]
*  the reach of Iran. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  One is the head of the U.S. Navy in the Middle East, known as Fifth Fleet. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  It's in Bahrain. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=347.26s)]
*  There is also... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=348.74s)]
*  There are bases in Iraq as well, multiple bases there, that have also come under attack [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=349.9s)]
*  in recent months from Iranian proxy groups, well within, obviously, range of Iran, if [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  they were to decide to go after one of those. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=360.18s)]
*  Remember, Iran has actually targeted U.S. troops and the installation at Al-Assad, which [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=362.82s)]
*  is in western Iraq. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=368.3s)]
*  After the attack on Qasem Soleimani, they retaliated with a number of ballistic missile [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=370.14s)]
*  drones striking that base, causing a number of injuries among U.S. service members, primarily [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=373.86s)]
*  in traumatic brain injuries. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=378.62s)]
*  Those are three of the main ones that we're looking at. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=380.82s)]
*  But, Chris, there are a number of other installations there, and we cannot forget we're not just [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=382.74s)]
*  talking about the U.S. military assets that exist on land. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=387.26s)]
*  There are U.S. Navy ships at sea. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  They are also well within range. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=393.22s)]
*  These are the sorts of assets that we're looking at right now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=395.06s)]
*  We're aware of the information that's coming across the semi-official Iranian news agencies. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=397.54s)]
*  But at this point, the defense officials we're speaking to have not been able to substantiate [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=403.94s)]
*  any actual attack beginning. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=407.86s)]
*  But a U.S. official that I spoke with did say that they were warned about the possibility [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=410.7s)]
*  of an imminent threat against a number of U.S. military bases in the region. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=415.14s)]
*  That includes some of the ones I spoke with in Qatar, in Iraq, and in Bahrain and elsewhere. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=419.94s)]
*  Chris. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=425.98s)]
*  Thank you so much, Courtney QB. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=426.98s)]
*  Come back to us as we get more information. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=428.46s)]
*  But I want to bring in Brigadier General Mark Kimmett, retired and former Assistant Secretary [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=430.42s)]
*  of State. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=435.78s)]
*  We just got a statement from Iran's armed forces. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=436.78s)]
*  I'm going to read you little parts of it, if I can, General, in response to what they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=438.9s)]
*  call the blatant military aggression of the criminal regime of the United States against [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=443.58s)]
*  the peaceful nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran and in clear violation of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=448.62s)]
*  international law. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=454.58s)]
*  Iran has launched a powerful and destructive missile strike on the Al-Udeid air base in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=457.02s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=461.42s)]
*  The operation is being carried out under the sacred call. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=462.42s)]
*  The message to the White House and its allies is clear. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=467.42s)]
*  It says Iran will never leave any violation of its territorial integrity, sovereignty, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=470.98s)]
*  or national security unanswered. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=477.42s)]
*  We warn the enemies of the Islamic Republic. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=480.3s)]
*  The era of hit and run is over. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=482.86s)]
*  The determined will of Iran's powerful and popular armed forces means any repeated provocation [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=485.14000000000004s)]
*  will accelerate the collapse of the U.S. military structure in the region. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=491.26s)]
*  And so what we have is missiles heading for U.S. bases in the region. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=496.70000000000005s)]
*  Your reaction to what we're seeing right now? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, I'm glad we probably have some airplanes on scramble alert. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=506.06s)]
*  Hopefully they're up in the air right now taking on those ballistic missiles and possibly [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=510.38s)]
*  drones as well. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJh31oph_MU&t=515.38s)]
