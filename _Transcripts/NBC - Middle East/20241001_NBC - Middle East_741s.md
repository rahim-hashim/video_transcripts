# 'Pivotal moment': Iran launches missile attack on Israel, IDF says
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU)
*  David and John, I was at a briefing on Friday with a senior Israeli official arguing that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=0.0s)]
*  they needed to go into Lebanon, needed to destroy the command and control of Hezbollah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=6.0s)]
*  This was immediately after the strike. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=10.92s)]
*  They did not yet know whether Nasrallah had been killed, but they pretty much thought [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  he had been and that they were waiting proof of that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=17.64s)]
*  But they argued that there were weapons in tunnels in southern Lebanon along the Israeli [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=20.56s)]
*  border and that unless they destroyed those tunnels that there were weapons in homes and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=26.84s)]
*  rockets and military equipment all pre-positioned for an attack similar to the October 7th attack. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=31.92s)]
*  The description, David, by that Israeli official was that that Sinwar, the Hamas terror leader, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=38.84s)]
*  was still alive in Gaza, had jumped the gun and that this was a long-range plan by Iran [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=47.84s)]
*  through its proxies to encircle Israel and eliminate Israel by 2040 and that the next [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=54.6s)]
*  step was going to be a surprise attack by Hezbollah and that they had good intelligence of this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=60.64s)]
*  David, we don't know if that intelligence is matched by the American intelligence, but [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  that is clearly the motivation for Israel going in or saying they're going in. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  They were under huge political pressure to get their 65,000, 70,000 Israeli citizens [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=77.04s)]
*  who've been evacuated from their homes in northern Israel since last October 8th when [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=82.16s)]
*  Hezbollah started firing in support of Hamas after the massacre. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  And so they're determined to root out these weapons and go into these tunnels. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=91.0s)]
*  And that means from the air, they said, but Gatlin said yesterday, from the air, from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=96.56s)]
*  the ground, the air and the sea. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=102.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to you're seeing a very aggressive Israeli response and now Iran is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=105.56s)]
*  trying to strike back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  And for the Iranian regime, this is a major threat to them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Losing the leader of Hezbollah was an enormous blow to their decades old strategy of using [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=114.76s)]
*  proxies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=118.48s)]
*  And this is a sort of an epic moment right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=119.72s)]
*  Can Israel's defenses, the Iron Dome, can Israeli jets and American jets down whatever [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=122.64s)]
*  Iran has fired? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=129.16s)]
*  There are ballistic missiles that take only 12 minutes from launch in Iran to Tel Aviv. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=130.16s)]
*  In the attack in April, there were waves of drones. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=135.6s)]
*  Those were shot down very quickly. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=138.2s)]
*  So what's happening right now in Israel is just critical in terms of what new directions [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=140.28s)]
*  war takes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=144.52s)]
*  And John Brennan, this time we don't know that the Jordanians and other allies, the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=146.12s)]
*  Europeans as well, will be assisting in the air defense because there has been so much [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=150.48s)]
*  dismay in the region against Israel's going into Lebanon. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=156.0s)]
*  Well, I think certainly our European partners, you know, especially the Brits and some others, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=159.8s)]
*  will do what they can to prevent any type of loss of life inside of Israel as a result [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=165.4s)]
*  of Iranian ballistic missile attacks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=169.56s)]
*  Again, the Jordanians, you know, may be a question because, again, after looking at [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  what has happened in Lebanon and so many Palestinians and Lebanese who have died because of Israeli [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  strikes, the Jordanians might be a little bit more reluctant. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=184.8s)]
*  But at the same time, the Jordanians have been good partners to the United States and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  We certainly do not want a regional conflict and wide scale war because it could in fact [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=192.48s)]
*  envelop them and seriously threaten their national security interests as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=199.24s)]
*  So I would like to think that the players in the region as well as those supporters [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=203.32s)]
*  will do what they can to try to prevent this from just spiraling out of control. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=209.84s)]
*  But again, as we watch what is happening over Israel and if we see some, you know, explosions [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=216.84s)]
*  there to me that augurs ominously for an escalation because I think Israel will want to lash back [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=221.96s)]
*  at Iran and could be in a major way. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=230.72s)]
*  And as you can see over the night skies over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on your screen, it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=234.44s)]
*  is almost 8 p.m. in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  There's seven hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  School children were in school earlier today, but there is a school holiday starting tomorrow. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=246.12s)]
*  Leading up to the New Year's holiday, which starts at sundown on Wednesday. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=252.24s)]
*  So starting tomorrow, schools are closed through Sunday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=257.44s)]
*  So children will be home. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  They'll be near their shelters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=262.36s)]
*  Right now, what is happening in Israel is people going into their shelters. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=264.66s)]
*  Every building there has shelters, all the hotels. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  David, whenever we go to Israel on any of these trips, I've gone to so many with the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=272.64s)]
*  Secretary of State as he's been trying 10 trips, he has tried to negotiate a ceasefire [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=278.18s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=283.5s)]
*  And one of the biggest reasons was that all of the Iranian proxies had observed the ceasefire [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=285.16s)]
*  that did exist last November and for a few days in Gaza. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=290.06s)]
*  So the hope was that Hezbollah would observe another ceasefire. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=294.14s)]
*  Then they tried for a ceasefire in Lebanon, thinking that they could switch the sequencing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=298.66s)]
*  But clearly, they have failed at all of these diplomatic efforts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=304.34s)]
*  Matt Bradley and Erin McLaughlin, our thanks to you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  We're hoping that Erin is down in the shelter. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=313.14s)]
*  But coming up next, Ben Rhodes is joining us as well, the former deputy national security [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=319.14s)]
*  advisor. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=324.92s)]
*  Ben, you're with John Brennan and David Rhodes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=325.92s)]
*  Here is with me. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=329.78s)]
*  This is what the U.S. feared when they said to Netanyahu, for all of his reasons to go [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=331.68s)]
*  in against Hezbollah, they said, that's not the best way to get your people back into [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=337.2s)]
*  their homes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=341.4s)]
*  You don't escalate to de-escalate. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=342.8s)]
*  And obviously now, with the Iranian retaliation, Israelis are in their shelters as they go [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=345.88s)]
*  into the New Year's holiday weekend. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=354.02s)]
*  Ben? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think since October 7th, the Biden administration has had a number of goals. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=358.56s)]
*  One was obviously to provide support to Israel as it aimed to go after Hamas. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  But then also, one of the principal goals of U.S. diplomacy since October 7th had been [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  avoiding the escalation into Lebanon, precisely because I think there was an understanding [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  that Lebanon could be kind of a tripwire to this broader regional war, that essentially [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  it's one thing if there's a conflict in Gaza that alone is destabilizing enough and has [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=386.08s)]
*  obviously brought a tremendous human toll and has grinded on here for a full year. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=392.32s)]
*  But I think the concern has always been that if Israel launched a ground operation and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=398.88s)]
*  significantly escalated things in Lebanon, that that could draw Iran into a conflict [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=403.96s)]
*  in a direct way, as we're seeing tonight, and that then Israel might be compelled to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=408.56s)]
*  respond against Iran. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=414.3s)]
*  And then suddenly the kind of whole region could light up because you're dealing with [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=415.78s)]
*  Lebanon where there could be internal conflicts and obviously a longer term Israeli presence. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=419.74s)]
*  You're dealing with proxy forces like the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=425.3s)]
*  Iraq is a place that the U.S. always watches carefully for potential escalation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=428.58s)]
*  We have obviously enormous diplomatic presence and some troops there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=433.46s)]
*  And so the concern has always been that if the whole region kind of catches the fire [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  that has been burning in Gaza and kind of in northern Israel and southern Lebanon, we [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=441.62s)]
*  could see what we're seeing now. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=446.9s)]
*  And again, I'm struck by the fact that these are ballistic missiles. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  The last Iranian attack on Israel felt almost calibrated with drones and with other longer [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=452.18s)]
*  missiles that took longer to reach their targets, to kind of send a message without trying to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=460.9s)]
*  escalate things. This feels like the kind of thing that is going to compel an Israeli [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=465.34s)]
*  response at the same time that they're in Lebanon. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=470.66s)]
*  This is what the administration, I think, had been seeking to avoid for the last year. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=473.14000000000004s)]
*  And David, when we talk about the region, the militias in Iraq are of great threat to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=477.54s)]
*  U.S. forces there. The Iraqis, under pressure from Iran, were demanding the exit of all [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=485.22s)]
*  U.S. forces that hasn't taken place yet, but they've been drawing down. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=492.06s)]
*  This is a pivotal moment, I think, for the Biden administration. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  One of their goals, they've told some of our colleagues in NBC, is to try to prevent this [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=499.02s)]
*  kind of regional war from erupting in the Middle East between now and November 5th to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=502.85999999999996s)]
*  show that the Biden-Harris administration can deliver stability. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=507.58s)]
*  And so the killing of the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan al-Dhrala, which I think shocked many [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=511.17999999999995s)]
*  people, the success of the Israeli airstrikes, in addition to killing him, they killed [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=517.54s)]
*  multiple of the leaders. They've taken out large arms depots that compelled Iran to respond [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=521.62s)]
*  as they're doing right now. And it's what Ben said. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=527.9000000000001s)]
*  How does Israel respond to this? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=531.58s)]
*  If one missile gets through, or two, and dozens of Israeli civilians are killed in these [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=533.1s)]
*  attacks that are happening right now, there'll be tremendous pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=539.34s)]
*  to then retaliate against Iran. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=543.62s)]
*  So again, this is a grave moment, a historic moment. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=546.0200000000001s)]
*  We just have to see how events play out. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=549.9000000000001s)]
*  And Ben Rhodes, to follow up on that, you've been in the White House in these kinds of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=552.22s)]
*  circumstances, difficult circumstances, during your eight years in the Obama administration. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=559.66s)]
*  This is exactly what the administration did not want to happen five weeks from an election. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=566.22s)]
*  That opens up all kinds of issues as we see the lack of stability in the Middle East. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=576.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there are multiple concerns. Obviously, the initial concern is the safety [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=582.86s)]
*  of the people that are under bombardment now in Israel, also the kind of risk of scenes [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=587.18s)]
*  of chaos and violence and further loss of life in Lebanon, and the ways in which this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=593.8199999999999s)]
*  could escalate. And just to bring other concerns into it, that the Middle East kind of erupts [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=598.9399999999999s)]
*  in chaos, well, that drives up energy prices as well, something that has obviously already [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=604.6999999999999s)]
*  been a grave concern to the American electorate. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=611.5s)]
*  And there are all these other wild cards too, Andrea. Just looking out several weeks, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=614.46s)]
*  what happens with the Iranian nuclear program, which is now no longer under any international [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=619.34s)]
*  monitoring or verification? As Iran has kind of lost some of the capability that they saw in Hezbollah [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=624.78s)]
*  and Lebanon, do they feel like they need to make a move in the direction of pursuing a nuclear weapon? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=630.94s)]
*  You know, what happens to kind of the stability of governments like Jordan that have been [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=637.1800000000001s)]
*  under a lot of pressure from their own domestic populations? And so, anytime you wargamed this, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=640.94s)]
*  without getting into too much detail in the White House, you know, there really is a chain reaction [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=647.26s)]
*  that can get set off here. And Lebanon often is a part of the Middle East where those kind of chain [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=652.7s)]
*  reactions can get set off, because there are so many different parties that have interests there, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=659.5s)]
*  that are active there. It's not kind of contained in the same way that Gaza is, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=664.22s)]
*  because it brings in these Iranian interests, brings in different kind of regional sentiment. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=669.6600000000001s)]
*  And so, again, I think we are watching that scenario that has the potential to be, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=675.5s)]
*  above all, tragic for the people kind of in the crossfire in the Middle East. But yes, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=680.86s)]
*  you're right. In terms of the political calendar, for there to be an escalating war in the Middle [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=685.58s)]
*  East in October is certainly not anything that... I mean, I'd like to separate these issues from [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=690.86s)]
*  politics, but inevitably it enters into our politics. And I think Donald Trump will say, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=697.98s)]
*  look, there's chaos, and I'll end the chaos. And his strongman message will be his answer to this. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=703.5s)]
*  And here, the best politics for the Biden-Harris administration is better policy outcomes. And [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=709.98s)]
*  I'm sure that's what they'll be working towards frantically in the days ahead. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=717.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1UNiEjwynU&t=720.86s)]
