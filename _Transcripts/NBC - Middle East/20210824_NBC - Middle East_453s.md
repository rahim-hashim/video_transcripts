# Brennan: 'Very Encouraging' To See Dir. Burns Meet With Taliban
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU)
*  Joining me now is former CIA Director John Brennan, a senior MSNBC national security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=0.0s)]
*  and intelligence analyst. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Director Brennan, it's great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=6.12s)]
*  Boy, have I been wanting to talk to you about the threat levels now that we know the prisons [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=8.32s)]
*  have released all of these terrorist prisoners, the worst of the worst, from Bagram and other [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=14.32s)]
*  places. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=20.84s)]
*  And now a meeting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  How extraordinary is the fact that there was a meeting in Kabul between Mullah al-Baghdadi [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  and William Burns? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Well, I find it very encouraging that we have such high-level reach out to the Taliban so [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  that we can coordinate some of these moves at the airport in Kabul to ensure the secure [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  evacuation of U.S. citizens as well as others. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=45.44s)]
*  And so Bill Burns, who has extensive experience dealing with Afghanistan, is one of our nation's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=49.2s)]
*  most accomplished negotiators and diplomats, as well as who has the expertise and the longstanding [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=55.36s)]
*  presence of the CIA behind him as he meets with Baradar, I think that really sends a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=62.36s)]
*  signal that we are serious about trying to ensure the coordination as best we can between [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=67.68s)]
*  now and at least the end of the month. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  I also think it's a good move not to have a senior State Department person meet with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  we don't want to send any unintended signals that this might portend diplomatic recognition. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=80.8s)]
*  So I think having Bill Burns be that interlocutor, who again, knows Afghanistan very well, again, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=86.88s)]
*  I think this is an encouraging sign that they're moving forward with doing everything possible [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  despite those early misjudgments and missteps, I think, by the U.S. government. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=97.16s)]
*  But they're doing everything now over the last several days and over the next week to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=101.28s)]
*  try to make sure that this runs as smoothly and as safely as possible. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Now, what we do know is that the Taliban today said that they're not willing to extend the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=110.36s)]
*  deadline, and even by a few days, to get more people out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=114.6s)]
*  In fact, they're worried about a brain drain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, these are the people, the very people who are most anxious to leave, many of them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=120.48s)]
*  women who have been educated and couldn't be educated under Taliban rule. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  So what you know of the Taliban, what is the likelihood, first of all, that they will continue [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  as they are to cooperate and work with us on these parameters and not attack their own [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  citizens, especially half the citizens who are women? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't think either the Taliban or the United States government is going to negotiate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=146.68s)]
*  on this issue about when we're going to depart in the public sphere. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=151.52s)]
*  These are negotiations that are taking place, again, I'm sure with Bill Burns, as well as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=155.8s)]
*  with the commanders on the ground, how we're going to affect this safe and secure environment [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  and safe and secure evacuation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=166.4s)]
*  So I don't think the United States government wants to say, yes, we're staying past the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=167.68s)]
*  31st of August if there hasn't been already some understanding with the Taliban that that's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=170.8s)]
*  not going to then result in some type of conflagration there in terms of a military exchange or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=176.8s)]
*  engagement. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=182.48s)]
*  So I am encouraged that there are these backchannel negotiations that are going on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=183.52s)]
*  And so we may hear within the next several days that there is going to be an extension, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=188.72s)]
*  but it does take several days to be able to move out those six thousand or so U.S. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=193.32s)]
*  troops, as well as the other civilians, U.S. civilians who are there at the airport. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=197.48s)]
*  But again, I think there are intensive discussions going on between ourselves and the Taliban [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=202.12s)]
*  to see whether or not we can have some additional time to evacuate folks safely. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=206.4s)]
*  The word from the White House and the State Department has been that we've accomplished [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  our goal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=216.56s)]
*  We accomplished it 10 years ago when we got bin Laden, that we have decimated al-Qaeda. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=217.56s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=222.32s)]
*  There's plenty of evidence that al-Qaeda could could resurge is already there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=224.28s)]
*  Other groups, ISIS-K. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=229.44s)]
*  So have we actually eliminated the threat of terror groups, of Afghanistan again becoming [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=232.28s)]
*  a safe haven for terror groups? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  Well a lot depends on how one defines our goals in Afghanistan. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes, we're able to dismantle and destroy much of the al-Qaeda infrastructure in Afghanistan, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  as well as along that Afghan-Pak border. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=250.9s)]
*  We were able to kill bin Laden. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=252.94000000000003s)]
*  And we've also been able to bring a sense of normalcy to a lot of Afghan lives of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  last two decades, something that they didn't have during the Taliban. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=259.86s)]
*  But there is the near-term and then the longer-term concerns that we have about the regeneration [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=264.06s)]
*  of some of these terrorist groups. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=268.58000000000004s)]
*  Now I know the U.S. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=270.7s)]
*  government has in place a lot of capabilities in the region that they can call upon to be [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=271.7s)]
*  able to try to suppress the re-emergence of these terrorist organizations. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=276.74s)]
*  But clearly, as has been said publicly by senior U.S. officials, we're not going to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=281.3s)]
*  have the same capability if we don't have that presence on the ground throughout Afghanistan. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=285.7s)]
*  And we relied on it for so many years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=290.82s)]
*  The technical collection systems, the human source networks and other things. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=292.94s)]
*  So I think this is going to be a period of transition. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=296.6s)]
*  And also I think a lot depends on whether the Taliban is going to allow the growth of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=299.42s)]
*  these terrorist organizations once again to be able to threaten not just our presence [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  in the region, but even beyond here at the homeland. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=309.98s)]
*  Director Brandon, what about the initial decision to put the priorities, the safety of our military [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=313.74s)]
*  and a very important goal, in other words, closing Bagram and doing it in the middle [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=319.06s)]
*  of the night, above getting the civilians, the diplomats, Afghan allies out? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  Once Bagram was closed, that denied air cover and resupply to the Afghan military. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=329.32000000000005s)]
*  They clearly felt that they'd been abandoned first by their own government, corrupt and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=335.88000000000005s)]
*  not feeding them, not paying them for a year in many cases, then by the U.S. pulling out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=340.12s)]
*  And so once they had no air cover, the fact that they caved in and flipped sides is not [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  all that surprising, is it? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=352.86s)]
*  Couldn't we have kept Bagram open longer? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=356.24s)]
*  Could we have put a higher priority on the evacuation and a well-planned evacuation? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=359.16s)]
*  Well, I think looking back on it now, yes, there should have been, I think, some better [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=363.8s)]
*  preparation and planning. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=368.24s)]
*  But I must tell you that the retrograde or the full withdrawal of thousands of U.S. military [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=370.2s)]
*  from basically what was a war zone, and doing that safely and securely is an immensely complex [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=375.2s)]
*  effort. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=381.36s)]
*  You have to coordinate with other U.S. government agencies. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=383.2s)]
*  You have to coordinate with host government officials and military forces, as well as [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=385.52s)]
*  with allies and partners. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=389.24s)]
*  And clearly, I think there was some deficiencies there, that that interagency and multinational [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=391.0s)]
*  coordination and cooperation did not go as smoothly as was hoped. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=397.18s)]
*  And I do think that there was this snowballing effect of the Taliban taking over. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=402.18s)]
*  And yes, I think the priority was, understandably, on ensuring the safe evacuation of U.S. military [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=406.68s)]
*  and civilians. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=412.44s)]
*  But at the same time, I think we had a lot of obligations and responsibilities to the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=413.44s)]
*  Afghans, as well as to partner and allied nations, who also gave blood, sweat, and tears [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=418.24s)]
*  in the Afghan struggle over the last 20 years. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=425.04s)]
*  Director John Brennan, former director of the CIA, thank you very much. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsvyvwRavU&t=429.24s)]
