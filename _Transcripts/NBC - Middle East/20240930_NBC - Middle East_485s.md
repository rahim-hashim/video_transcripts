# 'Every sign appears to indicate' Israel preparing for ground offensive in Lebanon
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ)
*  NBC's Raph Sanchez is reporting from Haifa, Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Also with us, retired Army Colonel Jack Jacobs, Medal of Honor recipient and NBC News military [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=4.04s)]
*  analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=9.16s)]
*  Aaron David Miller is senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=10.16s)]
*  It's good to have all of you here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=14.52s)]
*  And I know, Raph, you've got some new reporting on these Israeli raids. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=16.44s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Chris, an Israeli official tells NBC News these are small-scale operations being carried out [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=22.0s)]
*  by Israeli commandos who are crossing the border into southern Lebanon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=28.44s)]
*  We're just about 15 miles south of that border right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=32.56s)]
*  And this official says the goal of these raids is one, to gather intelligence, and two, to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=36.08s)]
*  probe Hezbollah's defenses, to see where Hezbollah forces are positioned, where they may be weak. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=41.84s)]
*  And we are learning of these raids as every sign appears to indicate that Israeli forces [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=48.64s)]
*  for a ground offensive into southern Lebanon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=56.04s)]
*  Israel's defense minister was here in the north of the country earlier. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=58.92s)]
*  He told the heads of local towns, local villages, that the next phase of the war begins soon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=62.44s)]
*  He was also meeting with Israeli ground troops, telling them that they will be expected to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=70.4s)]
*  go into combat at this stage. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=75.32s)]
*  No indication of exactly when a potential ground offensive could come. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=78.18s)]
*  I can tell you this is a country right now on high alert. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  You drive the highways of northern Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=86.4s)]
*  You are seeing many, many military vehicles, some of them on your screen right there, Israeli [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  tanks, artillery, moving, it seems, into position so that if the order does come for them to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=94.48s)]
*  cross the border into southern Lebanon, they can carry that out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  Chris, just a little bit of the broader context here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  If Israeli forces do invade southern Lebanon, it would be the first time that they go in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=108.96s)]
*  in large numbers since the end of the last war between Israel and Hezbollah back in 2006. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=112.72s)]
*  That was a brief, very bloody, but ultimately pretty inconclusive conflict. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=119.0s)]
*  Israel left without really pushing Hezbollah back. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  But then you go back to 1982, when Israel invaded southern Lebanon the first time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=128.68s)]
*  That was supposed to be a limited operation, and Israeli forces ended up staying there [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=134.4s)]
*  for 20 years. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=139.04s)]
*  That was a decision that rewrote the history of the Middle East. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=140.72s)]
*  And it seems that similar decisions are being taken by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=145.0s)]
*  and his government tonight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=149.68s)]
*  Israeli official tells us Israel's security cabinet will meet at 2 p.m. Eastern time, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  9 p.m. local. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=157.44s)]
*  We expect the top of their agenda will be any decisions around this ground offensive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=158.84s)]
*  And of course, Chris, this would be a major, major escalation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=164.2s)]
*  We have talked for 11 months about the possibility of the war in Gaza spilling out into an all-out [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=169.32s)]
*  regional conflict involving Iran and its proxies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=174.64s)]
*  This would be a very significant step. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=178.0s)]
*  We have already seen major escalation with some 1,100 people, including nearly 100 children, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  killed in Lebanon over the last two weeks as Israel has stepped up its bombing campaign. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  Among the dead, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a man who for decades has been [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=193.0s)]
*  feared and hated by Israelis for the attacks his forces have carried out, feared and hated [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=200.6s)]
*  across other parts of the Middle East for his forces' involvement in Syria. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=205.92s)]
*  I'll tell you, Chris, people here thought that that assassination would lead to very [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=210.96s)]
*  widespread Hezbollah rocket fire. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=215.76s)]
*  So far, that isn't something we've seen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=218.26s)]
*  But people here are on high alert. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=220.78s)]
*  Chris? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=222.9s)]
*  Well, and understandably so, Aaron, David Miller. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=223.9s)]
*  I mean, now that there is a meeting coming up in just 40 minutes of the Security Cabinet [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=226.02s)]
*  is in Israel about the potential for a ground offensive, what are the discussions like and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=230.3s)]
*  what's the role, if any, that the U.S. has in terms of influence? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=235.7s)]
*  You know, as I've said, the Israeli experience in Lebanon from 82 to 2000, when Ahud Barak, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=239.46s)]
*  Mr. Barak withdrew to acknowledge blue line recognized by the U.N., even though there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=246.06s)]
*  are disputed points along that border between Israel and Lebanon, was a very, very, very [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=251.0s)]
*  unhappy experience. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=255.86s)]
*  I don't imagine the Israelis are considering a military deployment anything like the number [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=257.54s)]
*  of forces they used, either in 78 when they initially went in and set up a security zone [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=264.06s)]
*  or in 82, where they essentially went to Beirut and beyond. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=270.52s)]
*  I think the objective will be limited, basically to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, military [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=275.62s)]
*  infrastructure, both above ground and below ground, and to clear that area of Radwan forces, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=280.7s)]
*  the elite Hezbollah military brigades, assuming they are still there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=287.02s)]
*  The real issue here, Chris, I think, is how did the Israelis tether their brilliant tactical [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=291.9s)]
*  and operational successes over the last 10 days with the objective that they say they [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=298.18s)]
*  want, which is a return of the 78,000 Israelis who have been forced to relocate from the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=303.22s)]
*  northern Kibbutzim villages and border communities? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=312.46s)]
*  And I don't see any quick way. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=313.46s)]
*  There's no military objective unless the Israelis are prepared to stay in southern Lebanon in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=315.22s)]
*  force. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=320.02s)]
*  And that would expose them, I think, to an insurgency, which would probably help Hezbollah [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=321.02s)]
*  regain some of the currency that it's lost. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  So Colonel, what will you be looking for out of this meeting and from Israel? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you believe that Israel wants a war now and is, I guess, prepared to do what needs [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=335.38s)]
*  to be done to win? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=342.44s)]
*  Well, nobody wants a war now, and you have to define what win means. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=343.94s)]
*  I couldn't agree more with Henry David Miller about the limited nature of the attacks of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=348.46s)]
*  all the actions on the border. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=354.34s)]
*  Netanyahu is under intense domestic pressure to make that border area safe so that these [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=357.7s)]
*  people can return to their homes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=366.38s)]
*  And they did something that focused not just on that, but focused on the strategic objective [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=367.88s)]
*  of eliminating Hezbollah's capability to repopulate the area north of the border and to continue [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=376.18s)]
*  to harass Israel by eliminating command and control nodes, the leadership, ammunition [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=383.58s)]
*  stores and so on, to make it difficult, if not impossible, for Hezbollah to reconstitute [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=389.94s)]
*  itself in any meaningful fashion over a reasonable period of time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=397.46s)]
*  The terrain up there is extremely difficult for an attacking force. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=402.9s)]
*  It favors the defense, cross-compartmented, and to the extent that any enemy seizes the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=408.38s)]
*  high ground, it makes it extremely difficult to move in any further than just a little [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  ways. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=418.5s)]
*  And so the objective clearly is to clear a zone close to the border to make it safe for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=419.5s)]
*  Israelis to return to that area. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=424.74s)]
*  Chris? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=426.78s)]
*  Aaron, it's estimated a million people have been driven from their homes in Lebanon. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=427.78s)]
*  I think 100,000, it's estimated, have crossed into Syria, and obviously that's a country [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  that has its own serious problems. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=436.18s)]
*  What can and should the international community be doing right now to prevent an escalating [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=438.82s)]
*  humanitarian crisis? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=443.82s)]
*  I mean, I think we're beyond that, Chris. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=445.14s)]
*  I mean, what did the international community do with respect to the last 10 months in Gaza? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis are responsible, as are the Egyptians, but events are in charge now, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=452.46000000000004s)]
*  Chris, and events are beyond, I think, America's control, let alone the control of the international [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  community. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62YTZpaqgQ&t=463.74s)]
