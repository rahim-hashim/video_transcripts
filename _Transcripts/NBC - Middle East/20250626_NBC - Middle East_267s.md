# ‘Trump is deliberately misleading the country’: Dem senator on Iran strike
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8)
*  And how concerned are you about the stability of our foreign policy makers to deal with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=0.0s)]
*  the thing that they've started to unleash in the Middle East by going after Iran and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=7.44s)]
*  sort of carrying the waters, if you will, for Benjamin Netanyahu's designs against Iran? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=13.8s)]
*  Well, Michael, I'm very concerned. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=20.28s)]
*  And obviously I can't get into the details of the briefing, but I agree with all the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  comments that you played from my colleagues. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  And it's pretty clear that at this point, President Trump is deliberately misleading [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=32.28s)]
*  the country about the results of the military action he took. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  I remain absolutely convinced that this was unjustified. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=42.32s)]
*  There was more time for diplomacy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  And instead of giving that time, the president decided, as you say, once Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=52.0s)]
*  had launched attacks on Iran to abandon the diplomatic talks and join those attacks, drag [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=59.16s)]
*  America into a conflict when he said he would be the president to keep America out of conflicts. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=67.96s)]
*  And finally, I am really worried right now about the information that the president and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=73.88s)]
*  political minions will allow to come out of the intelligence community, because right [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=82.72s)]
*  now the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, has essentially declared [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  that anybody who has a different explanation or different narrative is somehow a traitor [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=93.88s)]
*  to our country, which is just a way of saying to all the folks in our professional intelligence [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=100.56s)]
*  community that if you tell the truth, you're going to be punished. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=106.56s)]
*  That's very dangerous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=110.44s)]
*  Senator, this administration is obsessed, literally obsessed with controlling the narrative [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=112.16s)]
*  because if they control the narrative, in my humble opinion, then they can do all the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=119.36s)]
*  nefarious things that they would like. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=124.24s)]
*  But in order to do that, they need willing participants and members of Congress and folks [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=125.8s)]
*  in the media apparatus. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=130.0s)]
*  I'm going to play for you just a bit from Secretary Pete Hex. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=133.12s)]
*  I don't know what we're going to call what he did this morning, but he went before the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=137.16s)]
*  press. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=142.52s)]
*  We'll play a little bit, and I want to get your comments on the other side. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=143.52s)]
*  Because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=149.96s)]
*  because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=157.0s)]
*  against Trump because you want him not to be successful so bad. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=162.92s)]
*  You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=167.83999999999997s)]
*  How about we talk about how special America is? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  So we're used to that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=175.64s)]
*  But we also have an opportunity to stand at the podium and read the truth. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=177.2s)]
*  Senator. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=182.56s)]
*  Well, Simone, this is exactly what Donald Trump and Hexeth and others are doing, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=185.28s)]
*  They don't want to tell the truth. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=193.12s)]
*  They don't like it when the press tells the truth. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=195.28s)]
*  And so what they do is attack the truth tellers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=198.7s)]
*  And that's very dangerous in a couple ways. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=202.28s)]
*  Number one, that is, of course, what authoritarians do to try to undermine the free press and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=204.82s)]
*  those who are willing to tell the truth. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=211.68s)]
*  But it also sending this terrible message, as I said, to people in the intelligence community, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=214.12s)]
*  that if they dare present the facts to their countries or even the facts to other people, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  their higher ups, that they will get slapped down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=226.0s)]
*  This is how you get bad intelligence that leads to very bad decisions. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=229.32s)]
*  And in my view, the president ignored the intelligence before he took these attacks [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=235.28s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=241.78s)]
*  And now they're ignoring the results because they don't like them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8cpJrXxN8&t=243.42000000000002s)]
