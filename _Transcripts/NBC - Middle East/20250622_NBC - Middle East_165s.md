# U.S. ambassador to United Nations: 'The Iranian regime cannot have a nuclear weapon'
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok)
*  Let's go live right now to the United Nations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=0.0s)]
*  We have a representative there speaking. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=3.08s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=4.68s)]
*  This operation sought to eliminate a long-standing but rapidly escalating source of global insecurity [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=5.68s)]
*  and to aid our ally Israel in our inherent right of collective self-defense consistent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=13.16s)]
*  with the U.N. charter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=20.0s)]
*  For 40 years, the Iranian government has called for death to America and death to Israel, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=22.76s)]
*  and posed a constant menace to the peace and security of its neighbors, the United States [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=31.28s)]
*  and the entire world. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Iran has attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles and through terrorist proxies. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=40.92s)]
*  For decades, Iran has been responsible for misery and countless deaths across the Middle [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=48.28s)]
*  East. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  Iran's government and its proxies have also killed numerous Americans, including American [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=56.64s)]
*  service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=61.8s)]
*  In recent weeks, Iranian officials have intensified their hostile bluster and rhetoric. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Iran has long obfuscated its nuclear weapons program and stonewalled good faith efforts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=73.36s)]
*  in recent negotiations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Madam President, the time finally came for the United States, in the defense of its ally [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=82.32s)]
*  and in the defense of our own citizens and interests, to act decisively. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=89.08s)]
*  The Iranian regime cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=94.84s)]
*  Let us be clear. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=98.96s)]
*  Iran should not escalate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  As President Trump said, any Iranian attacked, direct or indirect, against Americans or American [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=104.44s)]
*  bases will be met with devastating retaliation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=111.16s)]
*  To fulfill its core mission of maintaining international peace and security, this council [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  must call upon the Iranian regime to end its 47-year effort to eradicate the state of Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=121.16s)]
*  To terminate its drive for nuclear weapons. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=129.48s)]
*  To stop targeting American citizens and interests. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=133.23999999999998s)]
*  And to negotiate peace and good faith for the prosperity and security of the Iranian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=137.2s)]
*  people and all other states in the region. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv90iMHVDok&t=141.84s)]
