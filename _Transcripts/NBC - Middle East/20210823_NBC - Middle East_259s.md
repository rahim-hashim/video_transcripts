Video Description: Olivia Troye, a former homeland security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, shares with Andrea Mitchell insights as to how the special immigration visa processing system "was destroyed" under former President Trump by his top immigration adviser Stephen Miller. She says that Miller peddled "racist hysteria" to justify limiting the number of visa applicants who were approved, contributing to a back log that's stymieing the Biden administration's ability to process and evacuate Afghan allies at risk of retribution from the Taliban.

# Olivia Troye: Visa System For Afghan Allies 'Was Destroyed' Under Trump
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k)
*  Olivia Troy joins me now. Olivia, it's good to see you again. So, former President Trump is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=0.0s)]
*  strongly criticizing what's going on now, claiming he would have done a better job than President [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=4.96s)]
*  Biden at evacuating refugees. So, how was the SIV process handled in the Trump administration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=10.16s)]
*  when you were working at Homeland Security? And what impact is that having now on the backlog [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=16.32s)]
*  that the Biden administration inherited? Well, thanks for having me, Andrea. Yeah, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=21.92s)]
*  it's ludicrous for Donald Trump to go around saying that he would have handled this better and he [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=28.4s)]
*  would have figured this all out because he had four years when he was president to get these [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=32.64s)]
*  people through the system, to get them processed, to issue these visas. And the reality is that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=38.48s)]
*  system was destroyed under Donald Trump because of his main enabler and ally and confidant advisor, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=42.8s)]
*  Stephen Miller. And Stephen Miller went out of his way to reduce the refugee ceiling, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=49.28s)]
*  as has been reported throughout those years. And underneath that refugee cap, there are other [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  categories that fall under it and other programs that work similarly with it, like the P2s from [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Iraqis and that Biden has now actually expanded that program for Afghans and on the SIVs. And [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=64.72s)]
*  it was critical because what you see is that a lot of these people did not get the visa issued, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=71.04s)]
*  they did not get through the system. So, what you see today is now we're in crisis mode. And I know [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=76.0s)]
*  that it is a devastating situation, what we're happening there. But we would not be having to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=80.24s)]
*  push a system, a system that's already cumbersome and challenging with thousands of people through [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  it. The system's not meant for that. It's not meant to evacuate thousands of people at once [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=90.72s)]
*  if they had been properly processed to begin with. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  And tell me what went on internally when there were memos, in fact, about what Miller was peddling. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=98.64s)]
*  And he, of course, was that White House aides, very, very close to President Trump [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=105.76s)]
*  till the end, fiercely anti-immigration. Yes. I mean, these were staunch anti-immigration, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=111.36s)]
*  anti-refugee people who were spread out throughout the U.S. government. I mean, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  his main enablers were in charge of some of the refugee resettlement offices. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=122.48s)]
*  Look, I met with NGOs who were having issues, refugee resettlement agencies who work closely [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  with these offices, who couldn't figure out what was going on. And so what would happen is that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=131.92s)]
*  there would be meetings on this topic. Stephen Miller would cut people out of it so that people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=135.92s)]
*  would not know what was going on. And top military brass generals would push back on it. They would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=140.32s)]
*  write memos. I clearly remember when General Mattis couldn't attend a meeting, a cabinet-level meeting, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  where he was, he writes a memo actually on this topic, especially when the T-2s on the Iraqis, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=151.04s)]
*  because he knows that he can't be there personally and he knows the dynamics in the room. So he goes [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=157.6s)]
*  on record and has it distributed during a meeting to make sure that people know his position on this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=161.68s)]
*  because he knew what the dynamics would be. And we face this ongoing. I was in the White House for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=166.08s)]
*  two and a half years. For most of my tenure, this is a topic that I worked on. And I saw this start [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  off back at DHS, back when the administration first came into office. And this was General Mattis, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  as you're pointing out, the former defense secretary, trying to get the rest of the national [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  security cabinet. So we're going back to, I mean, he was forced out a couple of years early, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=188.08s)]
*  before the end of the administration. Correct. And they had acting secretaries. But he was trying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  so hard because he knew the importance of getting these SIVs out because they were people working [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=198.4s)]
*  with the Afghan military, as well as working in, as we know from an incredible memo over the weekend [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=204.08s)]
*  that NBC uncovered from State Department employees. Yes, absolutely. And the importance of this is a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=213.04s)]
*  message it sends to the entire world. Right. And the implications for national security, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=220.16s)]
*  because we rely on these people on the ground. They keep us safe. They do their interpreters. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=224.56s)]
*  They lead us. And so we really need them as our allies going forward. And the world is watching. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  They watch this process and see how we treat these people who are our allies. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=233.76s)]
*  Olivia, thank you so very much. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKPY1f0p6k&t=236.64s)]
