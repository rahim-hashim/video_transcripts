Video Description: Jen Psaki looks at the strenuous lengths to which Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard are going to support Donald Trump's story that bombing Iran was a work of military genius that obliterated the Iranian nuclear program, even as facts continue to emerge that suggest a different reality.

# Trump team frantically moves goalposts, throws tantrums to preserve Trump Iran bombing story
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M)
*  So there has been a scandal at the Pentagon every single day since January 25th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, every single day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Because every day since January 25th, Pete Hegseth has been the Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=8.26s)]
*  And some days, that scandal is more jarring than others. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Like today, when the country and the entire world really turned to the Pentagon, tuned [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=17.96s)]
*  in this morning for an update on the outcome of the U.S. strikes on Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=23.64s)]
*  And instead, they got this meltdown. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=28.2s)]
*  In hunting for scandals all the time, in trying to find wedges and spin stories, this press [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=32.8s)]
*  corps and the press corps miss historic moments. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=40.08s)]
*  Because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=44.7s)]
*  against Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=50.6s)]
*  Let's take half truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=51.6s)]
*  Classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  president look bad. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=63.44s)]
*  But just a little portion, just a little portion that makes it seem like maybe the strike wasn't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=64.52s)]
*  effective. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=68.64s)]
*  If you want to know what's going on at Fordow, you better go there and get a big shovel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=69.64s)]
*  That was Trump Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who I would note was until recently a Fox [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=75.0s)]
*  News anchor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=79.88000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what was in his coffee this morning because that took place at 8 a.m. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  Now if he had behaved like that on Fox News, even many of their viewers, many of their [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  loyal viewers might have been alarmed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=89.08s)]
*  But he's not a Fox News weekend anchor anymore. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=91.92s)]
*  He is the Secretary of Defense and he was speaking from the Pentagon. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=94.36s)]
*  He was answering questions about a series of recent reports based on intelligence from [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=98.76s)]
*  inside Hegseth's own agency that say Trump's strikes on Iran did not obliterate Iran's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=103.28s)]
*  nuclear sites, like Trump has claimed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=108.2s)]
*  Intelligence analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency, again, the Pentagon's own [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  intelligence arm, said that Saturday's U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=115.08s)]
*  strike did not destroy Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  And the best question of the day on that reporting came from a former colleague of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth, Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=125.84s)]
*  Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=131.24s)]
*  Fordow Mountain or some of it because there were satellite photos that showed more than a dozen [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=136.8s)]
*  trucks there two days in advance? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=141.72s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=143.68s)]
*  That is kind of the question right now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=148.36s)]
*  It is the question. And the satellite imagery she's referencing from days before the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=150.72s)]
*  U.S. strike shows a line of 16 cargo trucks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  You can see it right there on the screen, lines up at the entrance to the underground [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=159.36s)]
*  nuclear site, the U.S. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  bombs. But it's not even just the photos, which everybody can see. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=164.48s)]
*  Earlier this week, two Israeli officials with knowledge of the matter told The New York Times that they had [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=168.64s)]
*  intelligence that Iran had moved nearly 900 pounds of enriched uranium from the site in the days before the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=173.0s)]
*  attack. So are you certain none of the highly enriched uranium was moved is the question of the moment? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=178.64s)]
*  Because it tells us whether or not Iran has materials to continue pursuing a nuclear program. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=184.88s)]
*  It was a good question. It was the right question. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=190.12s)]
*  And this is how Pete Hegseth answered that question. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=192.32s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=197.6s)]
*  Of course, we're watching every single aspect. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=200.56s)]
*  But, Jennifer, you've been about the worst, the one who misrepresents the most intentionally. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=202.16s)]
*  I should say, Jennifer Griffin is a tough reporter. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=210.04s)]
*  I've been on the other end of that, and she's the person who relentlessly presses every [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=213.32s)]
*  administration because that's her job, whether they're Republicans in power or Democrats in power. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=217.76s)]
*  It's, of course, actually Secretary Hegseth, who has been misrepresenting things intentionally for months now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=223.88s)]
*  And this is all seems to be a part of a desperate attempt to avoid actually answering questions about the military [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  strikes last week. And that kind of evasiveness is a hallmark of his time at the Pentagon. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=235.32s)]
*  It's not a one off this morning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, just a week after being sworn in, Hegseth kicked the New York Times, NBC News, NPR and Politico out of their [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  Pentagon offices because he did not want these reputable, hard hitting news organizations to have as much easy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=248.8s)]
*  access to the building. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=255.0s)]
*  And back in April, a former adviser of Hegseth went on Megyn Kelly's show and talked about his genuine concern about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=256.72s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, given how obsessed he had become with leaks. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=263.32s)]
*  Do you think he's OK? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=269.36s)]
*  Do you think Pete is OK? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=271.12s)]
*  Yeah, I honestly I don't know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure. He was very focused on the leaks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=275.12s)]
*  And honestly, I think it's kind of like consumed the team a little bit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=278.12s)]
*  Like if you look at a pie chart of the secretary's day at this point, 50 percent of it's probably leak [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=281.76s)]
*  investigation press. Like it's that like that can't be. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=287.8s)]
*  That's the bad thing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=290.6s)]
*  I mean, 50 percent of his time on leaks, he is the secretary of defense. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=293.2s)]
*  And one of his closest staffers said, I'm not sure if he's OK. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  And that interview, by the way, was before we bombed her on long before. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=302.2s)]
*  Think it's safe to say he's only become more obsessed with leaks and pushing the media out and less OK since then. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=306.68s)]
*  But what's clear is that Pete Hegseth will say and basically do anything to keep the boss happy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=315.52s)]
*  I mean, even this morning, it seemed like Hegseth was speaking less to the American public or the reporters in the room or his [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  counterparts around the world and more like he was kind of speaking to an audience of one. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=327.2s)]
*  And this morning, Pete Hegseth knew exactly what the assignment was. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=332.28s)]
*  I mean, maybe Trump even told him directly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=336.64s)]
*  And Trump has spent the past few days calling for journalists who reported on U.S. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  intelligence to be fired, some of them by name, because that intelligence says his strike was not as successful as he [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=343.32s)]
*  claims. And he probably knew that he could get at least a few of his lackeys to go out there and do his bidding. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  Last night and this morning, Trump even promoted Hegseth's press conference, posted about it, which is not something [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  he normally does, saying that the fake news had been lying and Hegseth would tell the truth. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=361.4s)]
*  And then at today's press conference, Hegseth didn't provide evidence that the strike had successfully destroyed [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=366.88s)]
*  Iran's nuclear capabilities because perhaps it doesn't exist. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=373.4s)]
*  But he did aggressively attempt to shift the definition of success. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=377.12s)]
*  That seemed to be part of his goal as well. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  Maybe a directed goal. Who knows? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=382.84s)]
*  As the New York Times put it, the briefing gave no new assessments of the state of Iran's nuclear program or the damage to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=385.12s)]
*  the sites. Instead, the briefing focused on the planning and execution of those strikes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=390.4s)]
*  That is a classic case of moving the goalposts. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=396.28s)]
*  Doesn't matter anymore if we destroyed anything, according to Pete Hegseth, what matters was how well planned it all was. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=400.2s)]
*  To give you a little reminder, though, of where the goalposts used to be just a few days ago, on Sunday after the strikes, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance declared that we were not at war with Iran, but that we were at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  Literally, that was his quote. Got it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=419.2s)]
*  So the idea was not to start a war with Iran, but to destroy Iran's enriched uranium and prevent the country from being able to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=421.6s)]
*  build a nuclear weapon. That was the stated goal by the vice president of the United States on Sunday, four days ago. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=428.4s)]
*  Here's what Republican senators said today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=434.92s)]
*  It's not part of the mission to destroy all their enriched uranium or to seize it or anything else. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=439.52s)]
*  I don't know where the 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium exists, but it wasn't part of the target set. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=445.64s)]
*  I have no idea what you're talking about. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  None of them do, it seems, at this point. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  So the Republican Party line here is that whatever Trump did was the right decision, even if it was different from what he was saying [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=457.44s)]
*  yesterday. Whatever intelligence there is about what actually happened or whatever our previously stated goals used to be, that doesn't [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  matter. They'd rather keep moving the goalposts and kind of gaslight all of us rather than respond to the facts. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  And they've been following the direction of their leader since this whole thing started. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=484.12s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=486.92s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=490.6s)]
*  Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=495.48s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  Back in March, Trump's director of national intelligence, who they're referring to, which you probably all remember, but she told the Senate [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=500.72s)]
*  Intelligence Committee that U.S. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  intelligence, that U.S. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=508.12s)]
*  intelligence community did not believe that Iran was building a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=509.32000000000005s)]
*  Then a few weeks, a few weeks ago, Tulsi Gabbard posted this kind of weird, strange, bizarre, straight to camera video on her personal [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=512.76s)]
*  Twitter account. In it, she tells the public that we are, quote, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=519.88s)]
*  because of political elite and warmongers carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=526.72s)]
*  Again, posted on her personal account. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=532.88s)]
*  I don't know what Tulsi Gabbard knew when she posted that cryptic video or entirely what her goal was. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=534.88s)]
*  But three days later, Israel struck Iran's nuclear sites, starting the back and forth that led to the U.S. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=539.48s)]
*  strikes. Clearly, Trump was not a fan of whatever intelligence or analysis Tulsi Gabbard had been providing him with, he said so much [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=545.28s)]
*  publicly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=551.92s)]
*  But now Gabbard appears to be falling back in line. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=553.24s)]
*  I mean, yesterday, Gabbard announced that she magically had new intelligence that shows that the U.S. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  strikes really did destroy Iran's nuclear sites, that new intelligence very conveniently contradicts the assessment Trump has been so [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=561.56s)]
*  mad about all week. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=568.4799999999999s)]
*  Now, new data means analysis can change and the intelligence on this matter is evolving. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  But the thing is, Tulsi Gabbard has a huge credibility problem here for a range of reasons, including the fact that back in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=575.36s)]
*  March, Trump claimed that a Venezuelan gang was perpetrating an invasion of the United States at the direction of Venezuelan [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=582.52s)]
*  President Nicolas Maduro. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=588.8s)]
*  That claim that a foreign government was invading the United States was the legal basis Trump needed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=590.88s)]
*  and deport people without due process. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=598.28s)]
*  That's what they were leaning into. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=599.92s)]
*  But there was a huge problem. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=601.96s)]
*  That claim wasn't true. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=603.72s)]
*  In May, the classified intelligence report contradicted Trump's claim, saying that the U.S. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=605.64s)]
*  spy agencies did not think Venezuela's president controlled this gang at all. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=610.56s)]
*  A few weeks later, we learned that Gabbard fired the leaders of the intelligence group who wrote that report. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=614.88s)]
*  Days after that, the New York Times reported that Tulsi Gabbard's top aide had ordered intelligence analysts to rewrite the report to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=620.72s)]
*  make it look better for Trump. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=628.12s)]
*  All that was reported just last month. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=630.96s)]
*  And now, a couple of weeks later, we are supposed to believe that Tulsi Gabbard, the same person I just described, suddenly has magical [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=633.64s)]
*  new intelligence that says exactly what Trump wanted to say and contradicts the previous U.S. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=641.88s)]
*  intelligence assessment from a few days ago. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=646.68s)]
*  Look, Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard are uniquely unqualified for the incredibly serious and important roles they have. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=649.8s)]
*  Their behavior can be so bizarre at times, it is almost funny. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=657.8s)]
*  But the stakes here couldn't be higher. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=663.0s)]
*  So the facts matter and the people in charge matter. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=665.16s)]
*  And whatever we saw this morning was a lot of things from Pete Hegseth. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=668.16s)]
*  That definitely wasn't what the American people deserve when we just use military strikes in a foreign country. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=672.88s)]
*  And it certainly wasn't the truth either. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=679.68s)]
*  President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=683.84s)]
*  Move over D-Day. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=690.2800000000001s)]
*  Pete Hegseth would like a word. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  Maybe he's not exactly a historian either. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieJU5t7A8M&t=692.8800000000001s)]
