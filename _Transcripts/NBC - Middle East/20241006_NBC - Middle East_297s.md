# Aunt of hostage: ‘The government has to do what it needs to do and bring them home’
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o)
*  Joining me now, Efrat Moskovitz. She is the aunt of Naama Levy, and that is a hostage who's been held in Gaza by Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=0.0s)]
*  And I want to welcome you in these obviously super difficult times as you looked ahead to tomorrow and marking one year since the Hamas attack on Israel and Naama's abduction. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=7.8s)]
*  I mean, how are you coping? What is it that goes through your mind? And what do you want to share with the world about Naama and your family's ordeal? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=19.48s)]
*  Hi, thank you for having me. Yes, it has been a year, but it also has been a minute or a second or an hour. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  Right. I think for all of us who are on hold, everything is kind of stood still for a year or 366 days, to be exact today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=37.8s)]
*  And we are still in that hell of day one of October 7th of last year, praying and hoping and fighting and just in anguish for this past year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=50.36s)]
*  Yeah, I cannot even begin to imagine. But we have images of Naama who's been abducted on October 7th. She's barefoot. She's bloodied. It is so disturbing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=63.92s)]
*  Do you know anything about her condition and her health? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=74.16s)]
*  We heard I think the last time was months ago. I want to say spring. And since then, we have not heard anything. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=80.36s)]
*  So we are confident and we believe that she's alive. But we have not had any confirmation for months now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=91.12s)]
*  Your sister, who's Naama's mother, refused a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accompany him to his visit in Washington in July. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=99.76s)]
*  With ceasefire and hostage release talks at a stalemate, what is your message to the Israeli government? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Focus on what's important. That's my message. That's my sister's message. That is my family's message where, you know, we are interviewing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=118.08s)]
*  We are participating in what we feel would actually make an impact as opposed to the theatrics around it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=129.6s)]
*  You mentioned the visit here in July. And our message is, yes, that's escalating to different fronts in the north. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=136.16s)]
*  And you talked about Iran earlier. But the most important thing is to bring these hostages home. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=145.04s)]
*  There's nothing more important than that. The country cannot heal. Our families cannot heal until that is done. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=153.0s)]
*  And that is the most important thing. And we are all really worried that it has taken a backseat to other efforts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=160.04s)]
*  As you look at the Jewish New Year, that has just passed. Yom Kippur begins on Friday. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=168.44s)]
*  What are you hearing from members of your community ahead of tomorrow's terrible anniversary? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=173.72s)]
*  What I'm hearing in the U.S., I'm hearing a lot of prayers, kind wishes, a lot of support. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=179.68s)]
*  And asking for forgiveness, right? Yom Kippur is around the corner on Day of Atonement. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=189.64s)]
*  And people are just saying, we're so sorry. This hasn't happened yet, that we haven't been able to bring Naamaa home. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=196.27999999999997s)]
*  And that is strengthening. And it's encouraging that the community is so supportive and so sympathetic to what is going on and what we're going through. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=203.92s)]
*  But it's not enough. The government has to do what it needs to do and bring them home. That's the most important part. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=215.52s)]
*  Can I ask you how Ayelet is doing, your sister, Naamaa's mother? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  She is such an inspiration. She is incredible. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=227.84s)]
*  I see her thrown into this unbelievable anguish and into the spotlight and into a fight she's never asked for. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=234.96s)]
*  And she is just... I can't say it without crying, but I watch her and I am in awe of where her strength is coming from and how determined she is to do every single thing she can to bring Naamaa home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=246.16s)]
*  And it's just... I don't know how she does it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think, Afrat, she does it a little bit with your help. I sense your unwavering support. And I want to thank you for sharing your story with us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=267.68s)]
*  We think about you guys a lot. Thank you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67biGQ7G0o&t=274.28s)]
