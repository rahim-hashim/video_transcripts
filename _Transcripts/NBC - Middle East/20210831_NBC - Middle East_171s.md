# Biden: ‘I Was Not Going To Extend This Forever War’
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8)
*  Let me be clear, leaving August 31st is not due to an arbitrary deadline. It was designed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=0.0s)]
*  to save American lives. My predecessor, the former president, signed an agreement with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=10.0s)]
*  the Taliban to remove U.S. troops by May 1st, just months after I was inaugurated. It included [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=17.72s)]
*  requirements that Taliban work out a cooperative government arrangement with the Afghan government. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=27.08s)]
*  But it did authorize the release of 5,000 prisoners last year, including some of the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=33.68s)]
*  Taliban's top war commanders, among those who just took control of Afghanistan. By the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=40.6s)]
*  time I came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=48.24s)]
*  controlling or contesting nearly half of the country. The previous administration's agreement [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=55.56s)]
*  said that if we stuck to the May 1st deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't attack any American forces. But if we stayed, all bets were off. So we were left [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=70.88000000000001s)]
*  with a simple decision. Either follow through on the commitment made by the last administration [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=78.68s)]
*  and leave Afghanistan, or say we weren't leaving and commit another tens of thousands more [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=83.72s)]
*  troops going back to war. That was the choice, the real choice between leaving or escalating. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=90.6s)]
*  I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  The decision to end the military lift operations at Kabul Airport was based on the unanimous [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=110.6s)]
*  recommendation of my civilian and military advisors, the Secretary of State, the Secretary [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=116.68s)]
*  of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all the service chiefs, and the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=124.2s)]
*  commanders in the field. Their recommendation was that the safest way to secure the passage of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=131.16s)]
*  remaining Americans and others out of the country was not to continue with 6,000 troops on the ground [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=138.12s)]
*  in harm's way in Kabul, but rather to get them out through non-military means. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycwvqTf9x8&t=145.96s)]
