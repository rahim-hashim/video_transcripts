# WH: Trump to decide in the next two weeks on whether to attack Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM)
*  Joining us, New York Times chief White House correspondent and MSNBC political analyst [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter Baker and NBC News correspondent Yasmin Vesugyan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=5.04s)]
*  All right, so Peter, there's news on Steve Woodcoff today, there's news on Steve Bannon [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=8.28s)]
*  today, there's news on assets moving around. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=14.8s)]
*  Up until a couple of minutes ago, it seemed like Donald Trump was on the verge of making [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=17.78s)]
*  a decision, but then you had the press secretary come out and say he's going to make a decision [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=21.94s)]
*  in two weeks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  And the reason I think it's important to bring that up is we've heard him say the, I'm going [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=28.64s)]
*  to make a decision in two weeks on so many things, so many times before. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=32.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering, does that imply to you that maybe this is not coming? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=38.68s)]
*  I mean, I know it's a big question on a big topic, but the two weeks thing, he's just [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=43.6s)]
*  said it so many times in the past, and it's never come to pass, those decisions or those [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=47.8s)]
*  announcements. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=53.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, definitely backing away from the edge of the military cliff here, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  By saying two weeks, he's giving himself time to rethink it, to see if the negotiations [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=60.72s)]
*  restart and actually lead anywhere useful, to see whether he can manage his politics [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  at home, which seemed to be quite fractious in terms of his base over that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=73.0s)]
*  You mentioned Steve Bannon, who's one of the ones along with Tucker Carlson and other MAGA [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  figures leading the critique of the White House for even thinking about participating [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=80.24s)]
*  in this Israeli strike campaign against Iran. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=84.8s)]
*  So he's basically put a pause button in effect on the sense that we were on the edge of an [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=88.32s)]
*  American involvement in the war, an offensive part of the war. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Where that leads, we don't know. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=98.56s)]
*  I mean, he himself said, nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=99.56s)]
*  And of course, what he didn't say was maybe he doesn't know what he's going to do because [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=101.72s)]
*  he doesn't, you know, he's very torn here, as far as we can tell, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  He has made a point in the 10 years he's been on the public stage of politics of being against [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=108.52s)]
*  forever wars, against Middle East involvement, against using force that often. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=114.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean he hasn't and won't. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=119.16s)]
*  He obviously did, you know, authorize a strike that killed Iran's Soleimani during his first [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  term and obviously authorized the campaign against ISIS that he inherited from Barack [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=126.44s)]
*  Obama. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=131.88s)]
*  But he also, as you mentioned, pulled back from one strike on Iran in retaliation for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=132.88s)]
*  an attack on an American drone at the very last second. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=137.0s)]
*  So where he goes on this, we can't tell right now, but he's basically hitting the pause [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=139.72s)]
*  button for a moment to see where this could lead. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  I want to play a little bit from the show yesterday, and I think it's important to bring [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=146.44s)]
*  this back up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  This is the vice chair of Senate Intel, Mark Warner, on this show talking about what he [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  does know, but more likely what he does not know about what's happening. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=160.52s)]
*  I have no foggy idea what American policy is right now towards this circumstance. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=163.28s)]
*  I'm the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=168.88s)]
*  If I don't have the foggiest idea, what do the American people know? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=171.16s)]
*  And for that matter, what do our friends, few friends remaining around the world know? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Last week he was saying Israel can do this on our own without our help. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  We have been helping them defensively, but now making these threats on tweet. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  What does unconditional surrender mean? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=188.88s)]
*  Who is Iran supposed to surrender to? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=190.76s)]
*  And as I said a little more respectfully, you start a war in the Middle East, it's easy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=193.84s)]
*  to start. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=200.6s)]
*  They are hard to end. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=201.6s)]
*  And I thought the American public, one of the reasons I hired this guy was not to create [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=202.6s)]
*  endless wars in the Middle East. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=206.72s)]
*  And with a lack of a policy, without any brief to Congress, for him to potentially take this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=208.76s)]
*  action. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=214.32s)]
*  Peter, how, give me the context here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  How normal is it for a member of the gang of eight to not have the foggiest idea of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=218.4s)]
*  what the administration is doing when it comes to potentially striking a foreign government, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=224.4s)]
*  striking their nuclear facilities, and you know, saber rattling against their leader? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=230.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think Mark Warner should feel too lonely in this regard. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=237.76s)]
*  I think there are people inside the administration who don't have the foggiest clue either what [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=242.08s)]
*  way the president is going to go. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=245.92s)]
*  Or as he says, what the policy is, because it does seem to vary depending on whatever [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=247.08s)]
*  statement he makes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=251.56s)]
*  Sometimes it varies even within the same statement that he makes, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=252.56s)]
*  He threatens on the one hand, you know, some sort of an all out attack and even a potential [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=255.28s)]
*  assassination against the Ayatollah Khamenei on one minute, and then the next minute he [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=259.68s)]
*  says, no, I'm really for negotiations. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=264.44s)]
*  We have a real chance here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=266.0s)]
*  So how much is he rattling the saber in order to try to leverage that threat into a better [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=267.48s)]
*  negotiation? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=272.68s)]
*  We'll see, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=273.68s)]
*  I mean, his own people say, look, he is the master dealmaker. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=274.68s)]
*  That's obviously not something that's borne a lot of actual tangible results yet in this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=279.16s)]
*  second term. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=283.56s)]
*  But he may be using this uncertainty, this confusion, this sort of unpredictability as, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=285.12s)]
*  in his view anyway, a tactic. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=290.04s)]
*  It reminds you of the Nixonian strategy they call the madman strategy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=291.88s)]
*  He told Kissinger, his secretary of state and national security advisor, to go out and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=295.64s)]
*  tell other countries that he didn't know what Nixon was going to do because Nixon was so [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=299.08s)]
*  erratic and crazy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=302.24s)]
*  Well, in this case, you know, you have a president again sort of so unpredictable that maybe [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=303.36s)]
*  that's part of the tactic or maybe he just doesn't know what he's going to do yet. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=309.44s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=313.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=314.2s)]
*  The other thing that Senator Warner brought up, and this is a question we've had, is, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=315.2s)]
*  you know, if you take out the Ayatollah, you want regime change, and that's what Israel [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=319.12s)]
*  wants. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  It's what the U.S. wants long term. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  What a lot of the region wants. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=325.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=327.72s)]
*  What a lot of Iranians want as well, maybe not this way. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=328.72s)]
*  But who's there to take over? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, let's take a step back because I think that's an important point that you made. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=334.16s)]
*  And I think for a lot of folks that don't necessarily understand what has gone on with [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=336.88s)]
*  Iran for the last couple of years, I mean, we saw the protests during the women's life [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=339.48s)]
*  freedom movement, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=342.6s)]
*  We know the large majority of Iranians do not like their current government. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=343.6s)]
*  It's a brutal regime that tortures Iranians. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  It is a brutal regime that has killed people not only during the women's life freedom protests, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  but during the Arab Spring movement as well in 2009 to 2011. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=352.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a regime that the large majority of Iranians do not want to see in power any [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=356.28s)]
*  longer despite the fact that they took over back in 1979 after the Iranian Revolution. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=360.68s)]
*  That being said, Iranians are extremely nationalist, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=365.24s)]
*  They don't necessarily believe, though, even with the fact that they don't want the regime [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=368.32s)]
*  in power, that the Israelis or Americans have their best interests in mind. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  And they think that especially because the way in which this campaign has been carried [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  out. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=381.0s)]
*  I mean, they are running for their lives, literally and figuratively, if they can. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=382.48s)]
*  And let's not forget the large majority of Iranians make a couple hundred dollars a month. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=387.04s)]
*  That is the average salary. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=390.68s)]
*  And we have an unemployment rate of almost 50 percent. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=391.68s)]
*  So a lot of people don't have second homes. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=394.16s)]
*  They don't have friends to go to outside of Tehran. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=395.36s)]
*  And there's an internet blackout. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=397.68s)]
*  So they don't know if they should be evacuating or not. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=398.68s)]
*  Or where they should go. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=402.04s)]
*  Or where they should even go. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=403.04s)]
*  They want to run. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=404.04s)]
*  Where they should run to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=405.04s)]
*  To go to, exactly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=406.04s)]
*  And so for them, for so many of them, they've seen the death toll. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=407.36s)]
*  We're looking at 600 plus people that have now died, including many civilians. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=412.24s)]
*  Young children that I know for a fact were in fact killed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=415.74s)]
*  Because of that, they say they're not taking us into account in this campaign. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=419.54s)]
*  Had this been kind of a more strategic attack, taking out all of the nuclear sites, nuclear [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=424.86s)]
*  scientists without the civilian death toll that we have seen so far, that seems like [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=429.82s)]
*  would be more of something that Iranians could get on board with. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=434.3s)]
*  But because we are now in a situation in which they're seeing this large death toll, they're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=436.62s)]
*  running for their lives literally and figuratively. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=439.9s)]
*  They're in a place where they feel as if we want to do this in our own terms. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=442.58s)]
*  And if you're going to go for regime change, as you just asked me, what happens next? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=446.38s)]
*  And nobody knows the answer to that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=450.26s)]
*  And let's not remind, let's, important to remind folks here, it's the exact same question [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=452.09999999999997s)]
*  we asked with the assault on Gaza. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=455.62s)]
*  What does the day after look like? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=459.29999999999995s)]
*  And we're still asking that question as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  And you were mentioning that there's been hundreds of deaths. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=463.46s)]
*  The New York Times had a little bit on the civilian impact. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=467.22s)]
*  And part of the reason why this has been hard for Western media to report is you can't get [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=470.06s)]
*  into Iran. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=474.98s)]
*  We can't get into Iran, yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=475.98s)]
*  We're getting a lot on the impact of Israelis who have been killed. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=476.98s)]
*  And Israel is feeling strikes in the heart of Tel Aviv that they haven't felt before [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=480.74s)]
*  and deaths. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=485.94000000000005s)]
*  But let me just read a little bit about what's happening in Iran, including an eight-year-old [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=486.94000000000005s)]
*  girl who loved dancing in a red dress at her dentist's office, a 28-year-old national [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=492.42s)]
*  equestrian champion, a poet one week away from her 24th birthday, a graphic designer [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=498.1s)]
*  who worked at a, worked at National Geographic, grandparents in their 80s. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=503.98s)]
*  I mean, these are, these are civilians, civilians who, I mean, if you're looking at the numbers, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=508.34000000000003s)]
*  likely did not support the regime either. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=512.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=514.78s)]
*  I mean, full disclosure, I'm Iranian-American. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=515.78s)]
*  I have family inside Iran right now. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=518.4200000000001s)]
*  My mother is trapped inside Iran. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=521.22s)]
*  A good friend of my cousin's, they were asleep and they were killed in an attack. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=524.5400000000001s)]
*  So this is affecting everybody. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=531.46s)]
*  It has become very personal for Iranians. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=533.74s)]
*  And because of the internet blackout, which is because of the Iranian government, because [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=537.22s)]
*  of the regime, right, you can actually call within Iran, but you can't call from outside [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=541.14s)]
*  Iran. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=546.7s)]
*  They don't know if their relatives, you know, a couple miles away are still alive at this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=547.86s)]
*  point, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  It's as if we're operating during a time in which the internet did not exist. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=553.9000000000001s)]
*  You've been able to get in touch with your mom? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=556.34s)]
*  Not for the last few days, but I personally, but I know I have someone inside the country [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=559.34s)]
*  that's able to contact her and I know she's okay. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=564.1s)]
*  That's good. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=566.74s)]
*  But it's not easy for a lot of people. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=567.74s)]
*  And listen, I have, you know, access and I'm able to reach her in ways in which other people [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  may not be able to. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=574.72s)]
*  But it's a difficult situation that a lot of folks are in right now. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=575.72s)]
*  And, you know, and a lot of Iranians are worried about what that kind of quote unquote day [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  after is going to look like if in fact there is a day after. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=583.96s)]
*  And again, it speaks to what you were just talking about with Peter, which I think is [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  an important discussion as to what President Trump will do next. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=590.84s)]
*  I mean, people realize and know that if the U.S., if and when the U.S. gets involved, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=593.88s)]
*  this war will go from zero to 60 or 20 to 60. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=599.12s)]
*  And I think it's also important to note that there are a lot of Iranian Americans here [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=602.12s)]
*  in the United States, a lot of Iranians who fled after the revolution. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=605.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=608.52s)]
*  Who can't go back. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=609.52s)]
*  I mean, there's such a tie between this country and that country. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=610.52s)]
*  Also a big tie between this country and Israel. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=614.24s)]
*  It's just, it's very complicated. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=617.56s)]
*  There's a lot of Iranians that live in Israel right now. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Z_XOyImdM&t=618.56s)]
