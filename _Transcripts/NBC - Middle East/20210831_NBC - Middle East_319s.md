# Leon Panetta: 'We Are Very Much Still In A War On Terrorism'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo)
*  I want to ask you because you referenced Richard Engel's interview, the extraordinary interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=0.0s)]
*  with the Taliban communications guy who said that Bin Laden had nothing to do with, you know, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=4.8s)]
*  9-11 and you were leading the team, had tracked for years, for 10 years, Osama Bin Laden, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=10.32s)]
*  with your CIA colleagues and then at the Pentagon. So obviously the Taliban has not changed its [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=19.44s)]
*  colors. This is not Taliban 2.0. Maybe just in contrast to ISIS-K, they seem at this moment [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=26.32s)]
*  less radical. But the counterpoint from the White House is they're not a threat to the homeland, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  that they are a threat internally and to each other and to the region perhaps. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=40.56s)]
*  But they're not a threat to the U.S. What's your response to that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=44.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, Andrea, let me just say that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=49.28s)]
*  victims of the hurricane. It's a tragic event and our prayers are with them every moment of the day. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=57.6s)]
*  Look, I think it's pretty clear that we are very much still in a war on terrorism, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=68.16s)]
*  dealing with Al-Qaeda in various parts of the Middle East, dealing with ISIS, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  dealing with other elements like Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab. And the reality is that those [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=84.88s)]
*  terrorists have one goal and one goal only, which is to kill Americans. And what we saw happen with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=94.56s)]
*  ISIS in Afghanistan with the killing of 13 Marines is a wake-up call that the terrorists [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=102.8s)]
*  are going to continue to try to target our country. Now, look, after 20 years of war, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=112.32s)]
*  we did a pretty good job going after Bin Laden. We did a pretty good job at trying to make sure [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=118.56s)]
*  that another 9-11 never happened. But the reality is that now having a safe haven again in Afghanistan [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  represents a continuing threat in terms of our country. They are continuing to plan [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=132.56s)]
*  for attacks against us and against our people. And for that reason, we have got to constantly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=139.2s)]
*  be vigilant. And I understand that it's largely a diplomatic mission, but let's not kid ourselves. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=146.72s)]
*  If we have to go after terrorists in Afghanistan, it will be a military mission as well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=154.4s)]
*  And what is our responsibility to try to extricate hundreds of thousands of Afghan allies [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=159.6s)]
*  who have been left behind and as many as 200 Americans who never got to the gates in time? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=167.12s)]
*  I think it's really important for the president today in his remarks to hopefully turn a corner [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=174.88s)]
*  here. He's obviously made the decision. He's accepted responsibility for the mistakes that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=180.24s)]
*  were made. But I think now we've got to show where we're going from here. And first and foremost is to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=187.36s)]
*  complete the evacuations, not only of the 200 U.S. citizens, but also the Afghans [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=196.16s)]
*  who fought alongside of us. We owe them something. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=203.44s)]
*  How do we do that, Mr. Secretary? How do we accomplish that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=206.16s)]
*  I think we have got to work not only using our CIA capabilities, not only using our contacts, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=209.12s)]
*  who I'm sure are located within Afghanistan, but also continuing to put pressure on the Taliban [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=221.04s)]
*  to cooperate with us in that effort. We cannot give up on those that were left behind. We're [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=228.16s)]
*  going to have to continue to go after them. We're going to have to continue to make sure [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=236.0s)]
*  that we are dealing with any growth of terrorism in Afghanistan. We're going to have to continue [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=241.28s)]
*  to put pressure on the Taliban. Very frankly, we should push them to create a coalition government. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=247.92s)]
*  That's their best hope if they want to participate in the governing process in Afghanistan. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=254.48s)]
*  And the last point I'll make, Andrew, is that we have got to learn the lessons [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=261.92s)]
*  from what occurred over these last few weeks, not only in the larger strategy dealing with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=266.64s)]
*  Afghanistan, but why were we not better prepared to deal with the challenges that we faced both [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=271.36s)]
*  in evacuations and in the situation that developed into chaos in Afghanistan? We have got to learn [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=280.56s)]
*  those lessons in order to make sure it never happens again. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=287.68s)]
*  Leon Panetta, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director, thank you very much. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=292.24s)]
*  you [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYbVNMyahJo&t=317.68s)]
