# Trump: ‘I may, I may not’ on plans to strike Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0)
*  We begin this hour with our NBC News team, White House correspondent Monica Alba, international [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent Matt Bradley in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=5.04s)]
*  Also with us, Samantha Vinograd, former DHS Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=7.16s)]
*  Threat Prevention, who worked on Iran policy under three different presidents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=11.96s)]
*  Monica, catch us up on the president's thinking. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=16.84s)]
*  Who's he listening to and why he may be considering a strike on Iran? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=18.96s)]
*  Yeah, and there were a couple of other relevant comments from what you just played there on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=22.44s)]
*  that took place last hour, which was he told reporters that in his most recent conversation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=26.6s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told him to, quote, keep going to continue [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  with whatever they have planned as they continue to exchange fire with Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  So that was notable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  And he was also asked about something that he had posted on social media yesterday where [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=43.08s)]
*  he wrote, our patience is wearing thin. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=46.92s)]
*  He was asked at what point essentially does that patience run out? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=49.52s)]
*  And he just told reporters that it already has. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=53.46s)]
*  So of course, this is a precarious moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=56.42s)]
*  It is a time where the president was answering many, many questions on this very fragile [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  moment in foreign policy, where he was a little bit ambivalent about whether he has made a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=64.38s)]
*  decision or not. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=69.26s)]
*  But in terms of your question of who he's listening to, we know that he huddled with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=70.26s)]
*  some of his top military advisers and some of his top cabinet officials yesterday, but [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  that it sounds like he's really also been in touch over the last couple of days with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=78.82s)]
*  key world leaders on this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=82.7s)]
*  We know that he spoke to President Putin of Russia over the weekend. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=84.06s)]
*  The president says that the Russian president offered to mediate potentially some conversation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=88.3s)]
*  between the U.S. and Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=93.58s)]
*  The president just a moment moments ago said he spoke to President Putin again yesterday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=95.14s)]
*  We're checking on whether he means a new phone call or that phone call from over the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  weekend. But a lot of questions still here about what the U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  involvement could be. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=107.44s)]
*  And we know that, again, he may have been presented with a menu of options yesterday, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=109.1s)]
*  but he has been inching closer to implying and trying to set out the rationale for the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=113.46s)]
*  U.S. further diving into this conflict and perhaps providing some military offensive [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=118.38s)]
*  support to Israel. We just don't know if he has authorized that, asked for that, approved [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=124.1s)]
*  that or not. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=128.9s)]
*  Sam, we know Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is still testifying in the Senate, but so [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=130.74s)]
*  far has refused to publicly say if he is given the White House options for a possible [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=135.54s)]
*  Iranian strike or strike against Iran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  What could those options include, do you think? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  Anna, we have had detailed military options to take out Iran's nuclear facilities for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=147.54s)]
*  over a decade. I've been part of those conversations in the Situation Room, and those [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=152.82s)]
*  options really require the use of a heavy bunker buster bomb known as the Massive [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=157.26s)]
*  Ordnance Penetrator. Only the United States really has the capability to deploy that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=163.78s)]
*  weapon with our B-2 bombers and to strike at Iran's underground facilities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=169.62s)]
*  If other assets are used, other offensive capabilities are used, we could set back the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=174.26s)]
*  program a bit, but that Massive Ordnance Penetrator would really be what would do [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=179.02s)]
*  irreparable damage to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=183.82s)]
*  Other military options could include, on the defensive side, more air defense support [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=187.18s)]
*  for Israel, as well as potentially launching ballistic missiles of our own into Iran [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=192.9s)]
*  itself. But those detailed military options have been on the table for a long time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=199.1s)]
*  And the question is whether President Trump is going to pull the trigger, no pun intended, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=203.38s)]
*  and allow the United States to deploy our B-2 bombers and this bunker buster bomb. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  You said you've been inside the Situation Room. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  What do you think those discussions are like? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=214.1s)]
*  What are the pros and cons? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=215.94s)]
*  These national security heads are all weighing or the risk reward of potential U.S. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=217.7s)]
*  action inside Iran. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=222.66s)]
*  Well, Ana, I know this president has a unique relationship with intelligence, but at the end [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=224.78s)]
*  of the day, the most important part of any Situation Room discussion at this time is what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=229.82s)]
*  the intelligence community is briefing and whether the president is listening to it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=234.9s)]
*  In every Situation Room meeting I was in, the meeting kicked off with an intelligence [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  assessment. In this case, it would be an intelligence assessment about the Iranian [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=242.98s)]
*  regime, really the supreme leader's intentions, whether the supreme leader intends [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=247.5s)]
*  to break out to a nuclear weapon and whether the supreme leader intends to keep Iran [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  fighting or for Iran to go to the negotiating table. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=258.26s)]
*  That intelligence assessment should be guiding the president's decision making. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=262.3s)]
*  And from there, the second most important part of this discussion, perhaps even more [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=266.58s)]
*  important, is the safety and security of Americans in the region. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=270.94s)]
*  And I am concerned, Ana, that this White House has not yet helped Americans in Israel [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=274.38s)]
*  to depart. And so I believe part of the deliberations based on my sources relate to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=279.86s)]
*  whether the U.S. will engage in assisted departure for Americans in Israel while [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=285.18s)]
*  considering these military options. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=290.3s)]
*  Coming back to the nuclear abilities and capabilities of Iran and this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=292.14s)]
*  Forteau nuclear facility, how much does the U.S. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=297.42s)]
*  really know about that facility and the potential fallout of striking it, Sam? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=299.98s)]
*  The United States has good intelligence on the status of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=305.66s)]
*  At the same time, the U.N. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=311.22s)]
*  nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has issued a public assessment of Iran's progress as it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=312.78s)]
*  pertains to its nuclear program, namely the amount of what we call highly enriched [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=318.98s)]
*  uranium or the material needed to break out and build a weapon that Iran is currently [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=323.34s)]
*  stockpiled. What is really under review is whether or not the Iranian regime has [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  actually decided to break out to a bomb. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=334.9s)]
*  That is where the intelligence assessment just a few weeks ago indicated that the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=337.97999999999996s)]
*  Supreme Leader has not made that decision. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=341.85999999999996s)]
*  DNI Gabbard reiterated that assessment a few days ago, and I believe President Trump [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  said he disagreed with that assessment. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=348.62s)]
*  So we do have decent intelligence on the state of Iran's nuclear program, but there [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=350.58s)]
*  does appear to be disagreement between President Trump and intelligence professionals [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  about whether Iran has decided to break out to a weapon or not. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  Matt, what is the feeling right now there in Israel? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=363.9s)]
*  Do they want U.S. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=367.34s)]
*  help? Are they rallying around Netanyahu right now? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the people that I've been speaking to really do want to see U.S. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=374.26s)]
*  help. And some of the things that I've been hearing is kind of like, well, why doesn't [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=377.42s)]
*  the U.S. just give Israel the bunker buster bomb that's needed in order to penetrate [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=380.78s)]
*  that Fordo facility that we keep hearing about? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=385.3s)]
*  There is a lot of anxiety about the fact that we've just endured bombings for the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=388.34s)]
*  past couple of days. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=393.58s)]
*  But I do have to tell you that over the past two days, for the past 48 hours, we [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=394.94s)]
*  haven't seen a fatality from any of these Iranian counterattacks. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=399.34s)]
*  We haven't seen many injuries. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=403.1s)]
*  Most of the injuries, according to the Ministry of Health here, are from people who [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=405.42s)]
*  either tripped and fell while they were running to these safe homes or safe rooms or [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=408.82s)]
*  they had anxiety. So really, we're seeing a big turn in the Iranian response. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=413.3s)]
*  So for the home front here, things are starting to look up. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  The Israeli authorities are lifting restrictions on people's movements. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=421.54s)]
*  So it looks like people and that's going to happen around now. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=424.98s)]
*  So it looks as though people are going to start to move around the city a lot more if [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=427.9s)]
*  they trust what the government is saying. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=432.42s)]
*  And I think most of them do. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  So I think that this is a situation right now where everybody is sort of waiting to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=436.06s)]
*  see what's next. But there's some level of optimism here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=439.94s)]
*  And, Matt, we were speaking with Yasmin Vesugian about what's happening inside Iran [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=442.62s)]
*  right now. There were new Israeli strikes just this morning in Iran. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=446.74s)]
*  What's your sense and what are you hearing there in the region about where the Iranian [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=450.86s)]
*  people stand on possible regime change? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=454.70000000000005s)]
*  Because there seems to be no organized opposition waiting to seize power. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  No, there doesn't. And I've been asking Israeli officials about who would possibly be [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=462.66s)]
*  working with the Iranians on the ground, whether or not they have partners on the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=467.1s)]
*  ground who can affect this regime change. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=470.54s)]
*  You know, one of the things that we have heard from the military is that their military [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=472.38s)]
*  orders are to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=475.66s)]
*  Those orders do not include necessarily moving beyond that and trying to unseat the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=479.46000000000004s)]
*  regime. And yet we've been hearing from Israel Katz, the defense minister today, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=483.98s)]
*  saying that they've started attacking things that aren't necessarily strategic. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  Intelligence headquarters, the state propaganda arm. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=491.62s)]
*  And, you know, they're really threatening not just the nuclear program, but also the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=496.34s)]
*  entire regime. At the same time, it's unclear whether they really have that day [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=500.62s)]
*  after plan. You know, and I think you can see this in a lot of the theaters where [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=505.08s)]
*  Israel has been fighting over the past year and a half, overwhelming Israeli military [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  superiority, but no real set plan for the day after for a political solution [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  that could ensure longer term peace. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=519.58s)]
*  And, Monica, President Trump has certainly been critical of regime change in the past. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  But then yesterday he was posting on social media that he knows where the Ayatollah [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=526.3s)]
*  is hiding, but won't quote, take him out for now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=531.3s)]
*  Do we know the president's thinking on possible regime change, where his head is on [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=536.46s)]
*  this specifically right now? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=542.18s)]
*  Yeah. And the White House had been saying in the last couple of days that that is not [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=544.38s)]
*  what it was looking for. Over the weekend, we had reported that, in fact, President [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=548.46s)]
*  Trump had rejected joining an Israeli plan to potentially assassinate the supreme [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=552.1s)]
*  leader. So this is an area where I think you're seeing a little bit more of the heated [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=557.22s)]
*  rhetoric and perhaps some bluster on social media from President Trump as opposed to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=560.6600000000001s)]
*  making some real policy implication in real time, though the repercussions are [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  significant. But we are now also getting a response from Iranian officials specifically [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  to what the president said a short time ago, which is that he implied there had been [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  direct outreach from someone in Iran to come to the White House, to come for some potential [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=579.78s)]
*  meetings, to perhaps resume some of those diplomatic talks. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=585.14s)]
*  But Iranian officials, the Iran mission to the UN specifically, is responding, saying, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=588.3s)]
*  no Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=592.78s)]
*  The only thing more despicable, the Iranians say, than his lies is his cowardly threat [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=597.06s)]
*  to, quote, take out Iran's supreme leader. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=602.38s)]
*  So that certainly had reverberations around the world when he posted that, as he [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  often does on his social media, doing foreign policy on the fly. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=609.86s)]
*  Yes. And what would a regime change in Iran mean for the U.S.? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=614.18s)]
*  Well, that's hard to hard to know, Ana. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=618.9s)]
*  It's hard to know what would come next if the supreme leader was not in power any [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=621.34s)]
*  longer. I do think that the news leaking that Israel asked for President Trump's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=625.58s)]
*  permission to assassinate the supreme leader and then, of course, President Trump's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=631.06s)]
*  true social tweet about Khamenei and knowing where he was hiding certainly send a [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=635.26s)]
*  message to Iran that both Israel and perhaps United States have excellent intelligence [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=639.9799999999999s)]
*  on the supreme leader's whereabouts. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=645.38s)]
*  That unto itself, along with Israel being able to launch a significant intelligence [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=647.42s)]
*  operation and military operation against Iran without Iran detecting that it was [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=652.5s)]
*  underway are unto themselves a black eye for the Iranian regime. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=657.46s)]
*  The fact that Israel thinks that it is capable of finding and assassinating Khamenei [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=661.3000000000001s)]
*  certainly publicly indicates that the Iranian regime is no longer capable of protecting [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=666.74s)]
*  its most prized assets. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4Ja5Ty-O0&t=673.3000000000001s)]
