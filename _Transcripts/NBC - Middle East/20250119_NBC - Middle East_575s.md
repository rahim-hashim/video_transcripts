# ‘A very happy moment’: National security advisor discusses release of 3 hostages from Hamas
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM)
*  Okay, we're going to spend a lot of time today looking ahead to tomorrow's inauguration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=0.0s)]
*  I've got a fascinating conversation with California Governor Gavin Newsom to show you, but I do [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=4.68s)]
*  want to start with that breaking news out of the Middle East, where just moments ago [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=9.32s)]
*  three hostages were released as a long-awaited ceasefire is now underway in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=13.8s)]
*  Now, the three women are now back in Israel, where they will receive medical checks and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=18.72s)]
*  treatment before making their way home to be reunited with all of their friends and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=22.7s)]
*  family. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=26.64s)]
*  You can see video right there on your screen here of the families of these hostages watching [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=27.64s)]
*  them as they joined IDF soldiers overcome with emotion and relief. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=31.34s)]
*  Huge crowds also gathered in Tel Aviv's Hashtag Square today, celebrating and cheering as [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=36.28s)]
*  the news of this hostage release came in. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=41.4s)]
*  A total of 33 hostages are expected to be released during this first phase of the ceasefire, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=43.88s)]
*  which lasts for six weeks, in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=49.44s)]
*  NBC News has also just learned that the first American to be released will be 65-year-old [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=54.72s)]
*  Keith Siegel on day 14 of the ceasefire, and that will be 36-year-old, and after that will [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  be 36-year-old Sikhi Dekel-Hen, who is injured as well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=65.88s)]
*  And the other five Americans, alive and dead, will not be released until phase two of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=70.28s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=74.32s)]
*  That is from NBC reporting. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=75.32s)]
*  I'm going to talk about it with my next guest. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=76.32s)]
*  And along with the release of the hostages, we saw another welcome sign today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  Aid trucks have started to cross into Gaza, bringing much-needed relief to a region that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=82.28s)]
*  has been suffering. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=86.28s)]
*  Six hundred trucks of aid will be able to enter Gaza each day, a significant increase [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=87.76s)]
*  from what has been allowed to date. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=92.56s)]
*  Now, this ceasefire deal took months of painstaking diplomacy between the United States, Egypt, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=94.28s)]
*  and Qatar. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=100.44s)]
*  And just in the last hour, President Biden delivered remarks on the release of those [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=101.44s)]
*  three hostages. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=104.8s)]
*  Three Israeli women held against their will in the dark tunnels for 470 days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=107.44s)]
*  Four more women will be released in seven days, three additional hostages every seven [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=113.4s)]
*  days thereafter, including at least two American citizens in this first phase. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=117.58s)]
*  We pray for them and their families for their going to be a long recovery ahead. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=122.64s)]
*  We got here without a wider war in the Middle East than many predicted. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=126.92s)]
*  And now it falls on the next administration to help implement this deal. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=129.92s)]
*  I was pleased to have our team speak as one voice in the final days. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=134.8s)]
*  It was both necessary and effective and unprecedented. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=138.72s)]
*  But success is going to require persistence and continuing support for our friends in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  the region and the belief in diplomacy backed by deterrence. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=147.4s)]
*  Starting us off today is White House Deputy National Security Advisor John Feiner, who [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=152.24s)]
*  is on his second to last day in the job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=156.0s)]
*  I'm grateful to you for taking the time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=158.24s)]
*  We've known each other a long time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  We spent a lot of time traveling overseas in diplomatic talks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=161.98s)]
*  It doesn't always result in a positive outcome. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=166.42s)]
*  And I just wanted to ask you, I mean, anybody who's read the reporting knows this took [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=169.66s)]
*  dozens of trips by Brett McGurk, by Tony Blinken, by Bill Burns, involvement by you, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=173.7s)]
*  by Jake Sullivan, of course, by the president. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=179.62s)]
*  What is it like watching the video of these hostages being returned of the families celebrating? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's a really good point, Jen, because you well know you don't get a lot of good [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  days in foreign policy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=191.3s)]
*  Often it's managing really hard problems and choosing among least bad options. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=192.5s)]
*  So when there is an unequivocally happy moment like seeing those three hostages come out [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=196.94s)]
*  of Gaza this morning, it is nice to take a minute to reflect. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=202.12s)]
*  Now, the reality is, though, implementing this deal is going to be a challenge. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  And because of that and because the six week period for implementation extends into the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=209.86s)]
*  new administration, President Biden has directed us to be totally transparent, totally open [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  and integrated with the incoming Trump team. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  They were involved in the talks. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  They played an important supporting role and it will now be on them to make sure this deal [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=222.5s)]
*  gets implemented as the president just described. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  And I want to ask you about that as well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=228.42s)]
*  But one of the questions I wanted to start with here is just about the status of the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=230.61999999999998s)]
*  Americans and NBC News. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  I mentioned this in the opening here, reported this morning that the first American to be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=235.66s)]
*  released will be 65 year old Keith Siegel on day 14 of the ceasefire because it's every [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=239.14s)]
*  seven days. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  So that would be one between now and then. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  After that would be 36 year old Saki Dekel-Hen, who is also injured. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  And then the other five Americans in the second phase. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=250.62s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=252.94000000000003s)]
*  So the way this deal is structured is that the people who come out in phase one of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=253.94000000000003s)]
*  deal are people who are wounded, are women and are what is defined as elderly under the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=258.06s)]
*  terms of this deal, basically people over the age of 50, which it's a little close to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  home if you're close to 50. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  But that's how the deal defines elderly. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  And so the theory there is the most vulnerable people are the ones who should come out first. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=269.86s)]
*  We see two Americans in that category, the two that you just mentioned. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=273.7s)]
*  After that phase two, there'll be a negotiation for how to start phase two. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=277.54s)]
*  It'll be IDF soldiers come out in that second phase. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=281.62s)]
*  And then in the third phase, remains of hostages who tragically did not survive would come [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=283.98s)]
*  out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=288.62s)]
*  Phase two is when the war ends definitively with a permanent ceasefire. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=289.62s)]
*  But for people who are waiting for an American to come back, obviously amazing footage, amazing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=293.14s)]
*  news about these three Israeli women today and one of them is a British citizen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=298.34s)]
*  Keith Siegel, we should anticipate not until two weeks from today. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=303.06s)]
*  So I'm not going to confirm exactly which date which people are going to come out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=306.22s)]
*  I think there's going to be some work between now and then to determine who comes out on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=309.58000000000004s)]
*  what date. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=312.66s)]
*  But that rough timeline is, I think, what we should expect. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=313.66s)]
*  You mentioned this earlier and Jake Sullivan and the president, you have all been very [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=316.74s)]
*  effusive in thanking the incoming Trump administration, Steve Woodcoff specifically for their work [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=320.1s)]
*  and efforts in this process. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  It's important to restate, I think, that this is the same plan as was proposed in May, that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=329.88000000000005s)]
*  have been, again, as I noted earlier, dozens of trips by Biden, high level national security [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=333.85999999999996s)]
*  officials to get here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=338.7s)]
*  Trump and Netanyahu obviously have a close relationship, a closer one than Biden. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=341.21999999999997s)]
*  Why do you think now? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, as you say, I think the president laid out the broad contours, the elements of this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=346.82s)]
*  deal back in May. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=351.82s)]
*  There was some fine print to be worked out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  But if you look at the deal that actually now appears on paper, it is more or less exactly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  what the president described back then. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  But there was a lot of work that had to take place between now and then. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  There were tragic incidents that took place between now and then, including the murder [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=363.38s)]
*  of several hostages by Hamas, including one American, which we all mourned and were outraged [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=366.82s)]
*  by. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=371.94s)]
*  All of that made this take longer, I think, than many of us wanted. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=372.94s)]
*  And at the end of the day, the president identified, even when attention moved on from the press, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=375.14s)]
*  from other governments, the president almost every single day would call Jake Sullivan [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=380.46s)]
*  or me or others on the team to say, what is going on with the hostage negotiations? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=384.26s)]
*  How can I help? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  Is there someone I should call? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  Should we be sending someone out to the region? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=390.46s)]
*  He stayed on top of this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=392.12s)]
*  And as you say, we deployed constantly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=393.52s)]
*  And when it got close to the end of the administration and became clear that implementation would [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=395.52s)]
*  go into a new term, he asked us, bring them in, tell them what's going on, make sure they're [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=399.8s)]
*  comfortable with the approach and see if they're going to be willing to help. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=404.94s)]
*  Now, you know as well as I do, we don't agree with 100 percent of what the new administration [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=407.96s)]
*  is likely to do on a whole range of things. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=412.92s)]
*  I'll let them speak to their policy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=414.48s)]
*  But on this issue, there was an alignment of interests and an alignment of messaging [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=416.16s)]
*  publicly to the Israelis and behind the scenes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=422.44s)]
*  I mean, you gave them credit for forgetting Netanyahu to kind of come to the table at [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=423.44s)]
*  this moment in time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=426.88s)]
*  The negotiation for a second phase, though, is going to require maybe the Israelis giving [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=428.32s)]
*  some things up that they don't want to give up. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=434.72s)]
*  Trump has basically said that Netanyahu should have unfettered freedom to move forward with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=436.92s)]
*  military action. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=441.2s)]
*  Is that the biggest concern about moving forward to a second phase or is there something else? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=442.6s)]
*  So that negotiation begins a couple of weeks into the deal. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, stay tuned for exactly how that will proceed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=449.44s)]
*  And it is what determines whether we go from phase one to phase two, the permanent ceasefire [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  that ends the war. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=457.32s)]
*  Everything we're told by our incoming Trump administration counterparts is that they have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=458.67999999999995s)]
*  every intention of bringing this deal all the way through phase two and phase three. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=462.28s)]
*  They're the ones that are going to have to help foster that negotiation. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  We wish them every luck in doing so and think that would be a very good thing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=470.12s)]
*  And if there are ways we can be helpful, I'm sure we will. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask you about TikTok. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=475.56s)]
*  I know you're very present on TikTok. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  You're not. I'm joking. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=479.12s)]
*  But it it Trump. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=480.56s)]
*  Donald Trump announced this morning on in a post that he was going to sign an executive [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=482.28s)]
*  order to delay the implementation. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=486.68s)]
*  Anyone who went on TikTok this morning couldn't go on TikTok. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=489.12s)]
*  Mike Johnson said this morning that he thinks it will be an effort to move forward to a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  sale to an American company. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  Is that the only way that this could meet the national security standards Trump identified [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=499.79999999999995s)]
*  in his statement? Or how could those standards be met? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=505.47999999999996s)]
*  So, Jen, it's not just national security standards. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=508.0s)]
*  There's a piece of legislation, as you know, that lays out exactly what is required now [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=510.2s)]
*  under the law. And I'm not going to parse the details or interpret it other than to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=514.64s)]
*  say. And I think this is important. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=518.96s)]
*  The last couple of days in this administration, the Biden administration, which is still in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=520.84s)]
*  office until tomorrow, has been quite clear. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  We are not going to take any actions that require the drastic step that TikTok decided to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=526.4s)]
*  take by pulling its platform down. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  We said that quite publicly. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=533.16s)]
*  They made a different choice. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  I think there are clearly conversations going on between TikTok and the new administration. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=536.52s)]
*  So we'll let those play out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  But nothing we said or we did would have required them to take the action that they took. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=540.96s)]
*  Clearly a discussion since they thanked Trump in the holding place if you open TikTok this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=545.96s)]
*  morning. John Feiner, thank you for your work. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfhqSWsIjM&t=554.08s)]
