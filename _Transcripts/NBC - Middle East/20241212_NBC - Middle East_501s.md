# ‘Hope’ new Syrian government are motivated to bring Austin Tice home to U.S.: Farkas
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo)
*  An American man missing for months has been found alive today in Syria. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=0.0s)]
*  He says he was detained by authorities and released from prison by the rebels after the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=5.64s)]
*  collapse of the Assad regime. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=9.88s)]
*  Travis Timmerman said that he was on a religious pilgrimage on the road to Damascus when he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  was arrested crossing into Syria from Lebanon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  The Missouri man says he was treated fairly well and was not tortured. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=20.44s)]
*  NBC's chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel spoke to Timmerman shortly after he [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=23.96s)]
*  was found in Damascus. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=28.0s)]
*  It's just remarkable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=58.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Evelyn Farkas, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=68.8s)]
*  and Ukraine and the executive director of the McCain Institute. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=72.64s)]
*  Evelyn, thanks for being here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=76.08s)]
*  The announcement that Timmerman was released initially raised hopes around four o'clock [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  this morning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=81.6s)]
*  A lot of us were getting very excited that this could be the American journalist Austin [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=82.6s)]
*  Tice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=86.08s)]
*  But then when people saw the video, they realized it was not Austin Tice. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=87.08s)]
*  It was another man, but an American. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  President Biden has said that Tice is alive. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  He's been there, you know, for all these years since 2012, but that the U.S. is not sure [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=97.16s)]
*  where he is. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=103.4s)]
*  Here is what Secretary Blinken, who's just arrived in Turkey, had to say before leaving [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=104.4s)]
*  Jordan earlier today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=109.16s)]
*  No update on Austin Tice except to say that every single day we are working to find him [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=112.44s)]
*  and to bring him home, making sure that the word is out to everyone, that this is a priority [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=119.08s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=123.6s)]
*  Tice's mother, Deborah, said last week that she's been assured by very good sources that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=124.6s)]
*  he is alive and has been treated well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=129.52s)]
*  So their confidence, and I talked to the siblings the other day, the brother and the sister, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=131.8s)]
*  they really are very encouraged by this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=136.36s)]
*  What do you think is happening behind the scenes trying to find him? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=140.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Andrea, we know from the phenomenal media coverage, including Richard Engel there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=143.72s)]
*  on the ground, that people are the Syrian people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=151.08s)]
*  And then, of course, some media with them are just going basically from jail to jail. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=155.28s)]
*  They're looking for hidden prisons. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=160.84s)]
*  Obviously, Austin Tice was somebody that the Syrians wanted to hold on to and did not want [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=163.16s)]
*  Americans to free him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=169.28s)]
*  So I would imagine that he wouldn't be easy to find. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  But I would hope that this new government, this new organization that's now in control [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=173.88s)]
*  of the Syrian government, the so-called HTS, their initials, that they would be motivated [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=179.56s)]
*  as a gesture of goodwill to really put out every effort to find Austin Tice and to bring [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=185.12s)]
*  him home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=190.56s)]
*  He has been there way too long. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  He was there, of course, chronicling the brutal civil war in Syria that Assad unleashed on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  his people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  And he's been one of the longest held Americans now in captivity that's currently still in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=200.38s)]
*  captivity. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  And the Biden administration says it's exploring whether or not to remove the foreign terrorist [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  designation from HTS. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=212.2s)]
*  This group, Mohammed Al Jalani, the leader, has been saying very moderate things, but [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  he does have roots in al-Qaeda, ISIS. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=219.18s)]
*  There are radical groups in that coalition. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  It's a very diverse coalition indeed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  They are leading the most powerful of the rebel groups, of course. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=228.66s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=231.94s)]
*  There's a $10 million reward on his head. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=233.54s)]
*  The UN and the U.S. have him on their terror list, but it's very difficult legally for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=236.18s)]
*  the U.S. to provide any kind of humanitarian aid as Syria tries to stabilize if they're [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=241.38s)]
*  led by a terror leader. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=249.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=251.5s)]
*  I mean, Andrea, this has to do obviously with the history of this organization. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=252.5s)]
*  They were a terrorist organization allied with al-Qaeda. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=256.9s)]
*  But a while ago, I don't remember how many years ago now, the organization severed ties [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=261.02s)]
*  and said that we no longer espouse the values, the agenda, the terrorist agenda of al-Qaeda. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=266.7s)]
*  When they came, when they first took control in Syria, in the Idlib area, they essentially [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=274.38s)]
*  went and reassured the Christians who were living there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=279.78s)]
*  And frankly, they've reassured Christians now throughout Syria that they will not be [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=283.5s)]
*  persecuted. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=287.58s)]
*  One of the things you look at when you're looking at a new government that's creating [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=288.58s)]
*  a government and government information is how do they treat minorities? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=292.94s)]
*  They have said the right things. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=296.8s)]
*  They have not conducted to our knowledge, I guess, any recent terrorist activities. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=298.94s)]
*  So I would kind of side with our former ambassador, Robert Ford, I believe he was the last ambassador [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=303.5s)]
*  in Syria, who said, you know, we probably should take a hard look and seriously consider [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=309.42s)]
*  removing the designation because these folks are in control. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=315.26s)]
*  And so far, they are demonstrating, again, inclusive inclusivity and that they really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  might be able to rule Syria in a way that is, of course, mindful of human rights and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  will uphold the sovereignty of the entire nation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=333.22s)]
*  And Jake Sullivan is in Israel today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=335.9s)]
*  Listen to what he just said in Tel Aviv, because there is talk about a possible hostage deal, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=337.7s)]
*  even with only 39 days left before January 20th. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=343.06s)]
*  We've been close before and haven't gotten there, so I can't make any promises or predictions [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=349.26s)]
*  to you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=353.14s)]
*  But I wouldn't be here today if I thought this thing was just waiting until after January [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=354.14s)]
*  20th. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=357.38s)]
*  I am here today because I believe every day matters and we're going to use every day we [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=358.38s)]
*  have to try to close the deal as soon as we possibly can. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=362.26s)]
*  I mean, there's a talk that Hamas might finally be willing to consider a ceasefire and hostage [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  deal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=370.61999999999995s)]
*  They've been disappointed so many times. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=371.61999999999995s)]
*  This is Lincoln's 13th visit to the region, and Jake as well has been going repeatedly. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=373.38s)]
*  Well, I think Hamas, Andrea, realizes that time is not on their side. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=379.14s)]
*  Their allies, the Hezbollah fighters, were dealt a massive blow by Israel because they [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=385.17999999999995s)]
*  joined in the fight with Hamas against Israel. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=390.64s)]
*  As a result of that, Iran also was weakened substantially militarily because of Israeli [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=394.3s)]
*  strikes against Iranian weapons depots. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=400.42s)]
*  So Iran was not available to help out Assad in Syria. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=403.62s)]
*  And so Hamas sees the writing on the wall. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  Iran is not going to help us out. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=408.98s)]
*  Russia is not going to help us out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=410.26s)]
*  We need to make a deal because the future will get only worse for us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=411.86s)]
*  If we can make a deal, get back. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=415.86s)]
*  They intend to get back several hundred, I believe, hostages that the Israelis are holding, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=417.92s)]
*  in exchange for the hostages that they're holding, which are up to 100, maybe a little [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  bit fewer because some of them may have perished. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=433.42s)]
*  But the Hamas folks realize time is not on their side, so I'm not surprised to see a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  deal in the making. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  And I will also add that, of course, President Biden wants this to happen on his watch. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  Interestingly, President-elect Trump has also said, you know, I want this taken care of. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=446.94000000000005s)]
*  So I think all the variables are aligning in the right direction here, fingers crossed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=451.3s)]
*  And we really are out of time, but I know that someone who was a global leader in 2023 [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=459.38s)]
*  for the McCain Institute, Jesus Armas, was arrested. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=464.82s)]
*  I know you're a waiting word. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=468.62s)]
*  And if there's any breakthrough on that, please let us know. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  Everyone, of course, is very concerned. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=474.46s)]
*  Thank you, Andrea, very much. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=477.7s)]
*  Evelyn Farkas, thank you so much. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7YL8nLxqo&t=479.22s)]
