# Brennan Says The U.S. Should Tap Money Levers To Control Taliban
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w)
*  Assuming we end up having to stick to this August 31st deadline, what are the realistic ways we can still get Afghan allies out? Is it just through negotiation with the Taliban? Is it covert missions? Are those too dangerous? What are the plans Cs, Ds and Es here? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I think Plan A is to try to stay at Kabul airport as long as we can in order to affect the safe evacuation of the folks we want to get out. And yes, we need to talk with the Taliban, but I don't think that we should allow the Taliban to dictate to us. That's why it was heartened that Bill Burns went out there and spoke with Mullah Barada to tell him what our plans are. Also, so I think send a clear message that the United States is going to hold the Taliban responsible for any violence that's perpetrated before the Taliban. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=16.72s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing.

I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=46.72s)]
*  to us. We're a lot of things [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=76.72s)]
*  that we're going to be able to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=78.28s)]
*  do in the next few weeks and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=80.12s)]
*  years ahead. Is it wise to use [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=82.98s)]
*  here with the Taliban or do you [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=87.36s)]
*  think that implies that we may [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=88.9s)]
*  recognize them and that's not [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=90.44s)]
*  something we should ever do? I [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=90.94s)]
*  think it's wise to use whatever [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=94.16s)]
*  sticks and carrots we have and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=97.1s)]
*  clearly the Taliban is going to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=98.0s)]
*  be very interested in having the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=100.88s)]
*  capability to govern to take [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=102.78s)]
*  important to them. And so I would say that, yes, we should look at those levers and see which ones [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=105.5s)]
*  we need to tap. It doesn't imply that there's going to be any type of near-term recognition, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=111.58s)]
*  diplomatic recognition of the Taliban government. But I think there are some things that we can do [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  in this interim period when they are in control, but they're not the recognized government of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=120.54s)]
*  Afghanistan, and to ensure that what we do is not going to further empower the Taliban, hopefully [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=125.02s)]
*  not, but will take care of the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people. We don't want the Afghan [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=131.18s)]
*  people to suffer any more than they already have as a result of staving off or starving off that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=137.58s)]
*  money flow into Afghanistan. So I think we have to find some creative ways to get that money in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=144.46s)]
*  there. At the same time, extract from the Taliban certain concessions or certain understandings [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=149.18s)]
*  about what they will and won't do when they're in control. If you're in your old job and the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=154.94s)]
*  president of the United States asked you for an intelligence briefing that was, what is the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=160.62s)]
*  ambition of the Taliban? What is the ultimate ambition? What would you say to a president that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=165.9s)]
*  asked you that question? Well, I would say that the Taliban itself is a different organization [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=171.18s)]
*  than it was when it left Afghanistan in 2001 or when it was pushed out of power in Kabul. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=178.22s)]
*  Although it has demonstrated, I think, tremendous discipline over the last year or so in terms of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=183.82s)]
*  taking the fight to the Afghan government, it is not a monolith. There are disparate views. There [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=189.82s)]
*  are pragmatists, there are moderates, as well as hardliners and extremists in the organization. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=195.1s)]
*  And so I think now that they are governing, it's going to be much more challenging to them [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=199.5s)]
*  than fighting the Afghan government. And so I think we're going to have to watch and see [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  whether or not Mullah Barada, who I do think has a pragmatic streak, whether or not he is going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=209.34s)]
*  see that there are certain things that he is going to have to do in order to govern effectively [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  and to be able to engage with the international community. So I would say that we need to sort of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=220.22s)]
*  watch and wait and look at what's going to happen and hold the Taliban accountable, not by its words [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  but by its actions in the country, how it treats the Afghan people, especially Afghan women, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=230.46s)]
*  and I think take it from there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwMcLInA7w&t=235.9s)]
