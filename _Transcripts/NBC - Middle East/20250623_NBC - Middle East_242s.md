# Full extent of damage on Iranian nuclear facilities is 'still not clear': Expert
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw)
*  Joining us now, Darya Dolzykova, a research analyst at the Proliferation and Nuclear Policy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Program. Darya, thanks for taking the time with us. The International Atomic Energy Agency did [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=6.0s)]
*  release an update on Iran's nuclear sites after the U.S. attacks. Their latest one mentions that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  you can see there is visible damage to Fordow, and enrichment tunnels and plants also appear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  to have been impacted at two other sites. What questions do you still have about the scale of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  the damage this morning? Well, there's a lot of questions still left. I mean, at Fordow, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=27.12s)]
*  which you mentioned, you know, we can see from satellite imagery that what looks like to be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=34.64s)]
*  craters, so impact points, but this facility is very deep underground, so it's actually hard to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=39.68s)]
*  assess what's happening underground, what damage might have been done, the extent of that damage. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=44.32s)]
*  Similar questions around the underground facility at Natanz. We've had a little bit more [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=50.56s)]
*  confirmation around the fact that some of the centrifuges or many of the centrifuges seem to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=54.64s)]
*  have been damaged at that facility as well, but the full extent is still not clear. Yeah, some of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=60.0s)]
*  the affected buildings at Esfahan also were related to the uranium conversion process, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=67.12s)]
*  that tunnels used for storage appear to have been hit, was additional information from the IAEA, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  and they said they do expect that there is significant damage to have occurred at Fordow [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=78.64s)]
*  because these very heavy attacks and involving vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=82.96s)]
*  So how long, if there were damages there, would it take for Iranians to repair and replace that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  kind of infrastructure? I mean, it depends. It depends to what extent they actually want to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  replace it and how much they would want to rebuild at the facilities that have been damaged. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Would they need to do so? Well, so there is the outstanding question of what material and what [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=108.96s)]
*  equipment might have not been damaged. So there's been some talk of the possibility that some of the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  IAEA and Resturianium at some of the facilities might have been moved in advance of these strikes, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=121.6s)]
*  that perhaps there are centrifuges, advanced centrifuge models that Iran still has elsewhere [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=128.0s)]
*  that it could use. Again, not to be tried, but we don't know. We don't know, but there might be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=132.4s)]
*  facilities that Iran could use to reconstitute using existing material that managed to save [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=137.36s)]
*  some of that. At the time of the attacks, Iran already had a stockpile of enriched uranium, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=143.12s)]
*  and you mentioned that they're claiming they moved some of that before these strikes. Here's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=148.96s)]
*  some of what the White House press secretary said about the impacts of these attacks on that stockpile. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=153.52s)]
*  Let's watch. We have a high degree of confidence that where those strikes took place is where [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Iran's enriched uranium was stored. The president wouldn't have launched the strikes if we weren't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=164.24s)]
*  confident in that. So this operation was a resounding success, and administration officials [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  agree with that, as well as Israel. Darya, is there any way in which the U.S. could actually know [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  that's where the uranium was being stored? I mean, I don't know what the intelligence capabilities [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=180.0s)]
*  were to identify specifically where the uranium might have been stored, but we had a decently good [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=189.04s)]
*  sense of the program in the last several months, years, because of international atomic energy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=195.76s)]
*  agency access. What has happened to that material over the last week and a half is a much more [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  difficult question to answer. So yes, some of the material was stored at Isfahan for some time, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=206.72s)]
*  but again, the last week and a half might have changed a lot of things on the ground. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=212.16s)]
*  So much to learn still. Darya Dolzykova, thank you very much for offering your expertise and sharing it with us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdijCKA_jiw&t=215.28s)]
