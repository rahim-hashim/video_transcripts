# ‘Gives hope’ to Israelis that ‘evil will see justice’: IDF spokesperson on Hamas leader’s death
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4)
*  Joining us now is IDF international spokesperson Major Deron Spielman. Major, thank you for being with us. This wasn't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=0.0s)]
*  Apparently a targeted operation against Sinwar specifically. How surprised were you when you got word that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=7.68s)]
*  You had gotten him [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  So, thank you for having me jose erin's details, I think pretty much match the record [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=17.92s)]
*  We were on an intelligence based patrols of the area of southern gaza known as rafa [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=22.96s)]
*  This by the way is an area that israel insisted we had to go into for military reasons [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=28.4s)]
*  To go after the highest level terrorist leaders and we were told by many of countries even our closest allies [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  We had nothing to achieve in rafa and now we can see we were on intelligence patrols [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=40.08s)]
*  We had information that sinwar and other high level intel operatives were in that area [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=45.2s)]
*  Most likely in tunnels and we tried to flush them out of those tunnels by slowly moving towards them [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=50.8s)]
*  Closing off tunnels closing off escape routes hoping that they would try to flee above ground [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=57.12s)]
*  In fact, we saw three terrorists. We assumed that that is exactly what they did. They were acting like fugitives [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  They were in as you can see an already abandoned structure that had been shelved and we carried out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=68.0s)]
*  Just the same military operation we were doing to look for every terrorist and this time we were lucky [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=73.84s)]
*  It was sinwar. We did not have precise intelligence [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  And we just feel like good luck shined with the people of israel and on the world [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=82.64s)]
*  This is a man of evil. He killed people from more than 20 different countries [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  He killed thousands of israelis sleeping in their beds [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=92.16s)]
*  He is our osama bin laden and today is a day that gives hope to the people of israel that evil will eventually see justice [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=95.44s)]
*  Among other things he was the mastermind of that horrible october 7th massacre [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  That killed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=110.72s)]
*  1200 plus men women and children i'm just wondering so he was with two other people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=113.02s)]
*  It seems as though and again, I like your thoughts on it and your information [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=119.6s)]
*  He was traveling with two other people. That's it. Whatever happened to those two other people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=124.24s)]
*  Who were those two other people and was there any find of of any other? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=128.4s)]
*  Hamas forces around that area [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=134.72s)]
*  Syria [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=137.36s)]
*  Yes, there was so first of all those two other people were one of the keys [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=138.56s)]
*  That gave away that this was sinwar's identity even before we found the dna [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=142.24s)]
*  One of them was the battalion commander of chan unis, which is a city in northern gaza. This is his birthplace [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  In fact, he was known as the butcher [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=153.52s)]
*  Sinwar was the butcher of chan unis because he used to butcher gossens that he thought were collaborators with israel [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=155.52s)]
*  We knew that he was traveling with this person. He had another apparently [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=161.84s)]
*  Employee of a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  Humanitarian aid organization with him when we saw the battalion commander dead. Okay, we we kind of understood [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  That's likely to be sinwar on him. We found [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=173.84s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of shekels of cash. We found ids. We found a gun [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=177.5s)]
*  It seems like sinwar left his tunnel and was just worried about his own skin [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=183.68s)]
*  He felt he couldn't travel with hostages [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  He needed to hide with a small group of people and he was fleeing for his own life, which is of course [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=190.72s)]
*  You know the same cowardly action if october 7th began [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  As you were mentioning with a cowardly action against men women and babies sleeping in their beds unarmed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=200.0s)]
*  It ended with sinwar fleeing for his own life while the people of gaza are living in the rubble. He left behind it's it's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=205.52s)]
*  Yeah, i'm sorry to interrupt you i'm just i'm just wondering about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=215.68s)]
*  The the hostages you said that he he was probably in one of those tunnels and is there any [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=218.88s)]
*  Light at those tunnels or any other tunnels about where the remaining hostages may be we're talking about more than 100 people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=225.52s)]
*  It is it's 101 people including let's not forget seven americans four of which are presumed to be alive [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=234.96s)]
*  After sinwar and his group executed six people just a few weeks ago [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=241.68s)]
*  We have intelligence obviously, I can't release the intelligence on air right now [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=246.4s)]
*  But I can tell you sinwar was verently against any type of hostage deal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=250.72s)]
*  That would allow those people to go free and we're hoping that in addition to our intelligence that we're acting on hourly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=256.08s)]
*  The fact that he's out of the way jose and that we can have a shakedown in the khama structure [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, I read the words you had on the screen. They say that they're, you know, not giving up [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=268.24s)]
*  Of course, they're gonna say that but as we have a shakedown in their structure [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=271.76s)]
*  Hopefully it will give voices to other people in gaza the same people who are celebrating right now that he's dead to rise [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=275.76s)]
*  Help us get our hostages home and create, you know a better future for those people [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=282.64s)]
*  So you talk about that structure. I mean israel has taken out almost the entirety of hamasa's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=287.36s)]
*  Leadership you've won. Why not stop now? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=293.34s)]
*  You know, there's a hundred and one reasons which are those hostages underneath the ground if we were to pull out right now without finishing the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  Job, you know, let's go back to world war two [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  Imagine if the u.s. Was this close to defeating nazi germany and they just said you know what we've done enough [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=306.56s)]
*  Let's just pull back there would still be nazi germany today [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=312.0s)]
*  You've got to finish the job. You have to defeat from us down to its core [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=315.76s)]
*  Defeat its ideology remove that leadership so that these young people are not looking up to these self-righteous [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=319.76s)]
*  Hommasadistic killers that are still giving the orders we need an entirely new regime change in gaza [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=326.96s)]
*  We need a breath of fresh air if we stop now [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=332.56s)]
*  It's literally giving hamasa past and we know what that means. It means another october 7th down the road [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=335.52s)]
*  We've got to finish the day before to get to the day after [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  And when you talk about people not looking up to the sin wars over the world many people are now [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=346.24s)]
*  looking at the destruction of great parts of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=352.32s)]
*  Of gaza and saying well, maybe what they're looking up to now is a different reality. Aren't you worried about that? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=356.0s)]
*  Of course, we're worried about it. No one had any hopes to go into gaza and try to root out a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  A terrorist core people who buried their buried themselves buried, you know tunnels directly underneath their civilian structure [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  It's on my mind. It's on every israeli soldier's mind. I've been inside gaza [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  I've seen what is left from sin war and hamas and are trying to find them inside civilian areas [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=381.44s)]
*  This was what sin war wanted. He was hoping that israel would chase them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=387.2s)]
*  He purposely put their infrastructure in civilian areas hoping the world would see this and cry out, but I can tell you I feel [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=391.52s)]
*  very [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=398.56s)]
*  Hopeful right now because the messages that i've been looking at on the internet on telegram are of people in gaza and brave people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=399.52s)]
*  That are saying that this is the greatest day of their lives now that sin war is dead [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=407.12s)]
*  They've even been speaking heber to the israeli people saying they want peace [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  I believe that there are enough people that will realize sin war the evil brought that destruction on them [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  That they will move beyond that and it to hope just like the germans did after nazi germany was defeated [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=422.72s)]
*  Is is aid going into gaza? I mean there is so much suffering and so much need [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=429.92s)]
*  Aid [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=434.24s)]
*  It is going in we take very seriously what the united states says and also what we feel as well [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=435.44s)]
*  That aid has been subject to an enormous amount of theft by hamas a very poor management inside of gaza by [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  humanitarian aid agencies [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=449.1s)]
*  But we have been pushing a lot of aid in there 120 trucks of tens of thousands of tons of aid of intergaza [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=450.56s)]
*  Just in the last few days and we're trying trying to wrap it up [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=456.72s)]
*  I don't want to see the people of gaza suffer. They've suffered enough [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=460.24s)]
*  We need to bring an end to this war get our people home and the threat to israel. We can have a better life [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=463.44s)]
*  They can have a better life [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=469.12s)]
*  You [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_-zNtZhWo4&t=490.0s)]
