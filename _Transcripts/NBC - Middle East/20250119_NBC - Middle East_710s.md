# Ex-CIA staffer talks reality of ceasefire deal for American hostages
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU)
*  by phone is NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, Andrea Mitchell. Also with us is the former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=0.0s)]
*  chief of staff at the CIA and the Department of Defense, Jeremy Bash. Andrea, can we just [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=5.7s)]
*  start with you? The Red Cross has been just critical in the efforts that we're going to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=10.82s)]
*  see over the next couple, has been in the efforts leading up to in terms of understanding [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  how the state of the hostages, they have been allowed access into see them. This is how we know that there are people that are actually alive. What can you tell us about how what we're going to see choreographed over the next just minutes, frankly, and then in the days and weeks to come? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=22.54s)]
*  Simone, It's going to be on and off and very difficult to assess as it was overnight when there was a brief halt in all this around 1 a.m. Eastern time. One thing we do know is that these three women are being released three Israeli women because officials in both countries and the negotiators have said they're in very bad shape. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=40.5s)]
*  So the good news is that they're coming out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=62.86s)]
*  The bad news and what is going to become apparent to Israelis, to their families, is that they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=65.46s)]
*  have suffered grievously. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=70.28s)]
*  We've been told by officials that they've been attacked in every possible way. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=72.16s)]
*  That is why they are the three first to be released. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=77.36s)]
*  And that is the sequence that we're going to see, the injured. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=80.86s)]
*  The last to be released will be healthy military, especially healthy military Americans. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=84.3s)]
*  And that is unfortunate for some of the American families as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=89.14s)]
*  The American families, the hostage families in general, have been very supportive, although [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=93.94s)]
*  distressed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=100.94s)]
*  Ruby Hen in particular and some of the others have been really supportive of their colleagues. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=101.94s)]
*  They're a big family, these hostage families, all of them together, especially the Americans [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=107.94s)]
*  who bonded as well as the Israelis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=112.14s)]
*  But they realize that they are not going to get their hostages, their family members, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=114.58s)]
*  their sons and daughters back, in this case all sons, there are no American women still [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  held. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=125.38s)]
*  They are not going to get them back alive or dead, equally important to them, until [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=126.38s)]
*  later in this whole process. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=132.98s)]
*  And the process, the second phase of which, this will start six weeks from now, hasn't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  even begun to be negotiated. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=140.18s)]
*  It was very perilous. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=141.78s)]
*  I should also point out the Red Cross, to your initial question, has been critical. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=142.78s)]
*  And one of the things that's been horrific for everyone involved in this, on the Israeli [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=147.18s)]
*  side and international hostages as well, is that the Red Cross was not involved as is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=151.68s)]
*  required under international law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=158.38s)]
*  They were not permitted to see the hostages. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=160.18s)]
*  To assess their condition from day one, that is what is supposed to be done under international [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=162.98s)]
*  rules of law, a rule of law I should say, and that has not been done. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=169.78s)]
*  So we don't know very much about the condition of some of the other hostages. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=174.38s)]
*  The Americans are not to be released to American men, one, Keith Segal, who is 65 years old, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=178.38s)]
*  the other is Sahih Dessal Ken, until several weeks into this process, it's a six week [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=185.18s)]
*  process. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=191.18s)]
*  And one of the critical things that has happened also, which is really unprecedented, is that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=192.18s)]
*  a big push to get this done came from Donald Trump, from his post on social media, from [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=198.18s)]
*  what he said in the radio program, just the last few days, from what he said most memorably [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=203.58s)]
*  on Tuesday, a week ago Tuesday, or two weeks ago this coming Tuesday in a news conference, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=209.58s)]
*  and dispatching Steve Wichoff, his potential U.S. media Middle East negotiator, his envoy, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=214.78s)]
*  already taking that role, dispatching him, going to Jerusalem last weekend, and basically [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=223.98s)]
*  laying the hammer down in some very tough conversations, telling Netanyahu that he had [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=231.18s)]
*  to expect that Donald Trump wanted this to happen before the inaugural, and now it is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=236.28s)]
*  Apparently, with every minute we wait to see with basic breath whether this transfer actually [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=241.28s)]
*  takes place, but we understand from Danielle that the 35 prisoners from the U.S. and the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=246.48s)]
*  West Bank are beginning to be released, and that was one of the last details that had [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=254.18s)]
*  to be worked out. What were their names? What have they done? Where would they be going? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=259.18s)]
*  Would they be allowed to stay in the West Bank? Would they be allowed to export to other [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=263.28s)]
*  countries, export to other countries? And whether or not these three women would get [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=269.78s)]
*  out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=275.78s)]
*  Simone? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=276.78s)]
*  Andrea Mitchell. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=277.78s)]
*  Andrea Mitchell. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=278.78s)]
*  The queen. Thank you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=279.78s)]
*  Appreciate you very much. Andrea, thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=280.78s)]
*  Appreciate you very much. Andrea, we've got Jeremy Bash here with us, and it's very interesting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=282.78s)]
*  one of the points that Andrea made, Jeremy, about Donald Trump sending his envoy, his [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=288.78s)]
*  private citizen sending an envoy. Yes, the president elected all of that, but this deal [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=293.78s)]
*  is something that has been worked by the Biden administration for quite some time. In fact, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=298.78s)]
*  let's listen to John Kirby explaining how this ceasefire deal got together in the first [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=304.78s)]
*  place. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=309.78s)]
*  This is the deal that the president put on the table back in May, was endorsed by the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=310.78s)]
*  international community, and time and time again, Hamas just kept throwing up obstacles [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=314.78s)]
*  and wasn't willing to negotiate in good faith. What changed was they're weaker now. They're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=319.78s)]
*  more isolated now, they're in more trouble, and so they're willing to make a deal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=324.78s)]
*  Speak to that aspect of this, that this was a process that requires a lot of pieces to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=329.78s)]
*  come together, but a central part of that is the weakening of Hamas along the way. It's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=337.78s)]
*  not just a hot rhetoric of there will be hell to pay if you don't do what we say. You still [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=343.78s)]
*  have to put in place the building blocks of a deal in order for it to hold, and to Andrea's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=348.78s)]
*  point, in order for that process to unfold over what will take likely six weeks, eight [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=353.78s)]
*  weeks or more. Well, the Israeli Defense Forces, Michael, decimated Hamas' leadership, and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=358.78s)]
*  they took out Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, and from that perspective, Hamas has been [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=363.78s)]
*  badly damaged, debilitated, and they don't have a command and control system. They also lost a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=368.78s)]
*  major ally in Hezbollah, the terrorist army that lives on Israel's northern border, inside [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=374.78s)]
*  Lebanon. That's one of the key proxies for Iran. In addition, after Iran attacked Israel with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=379.78s)]
*  ballistic missiles, drones and cruise missiles, back in April and then again in October, the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=386.78s)]
*  United States, Israel and a coalition of countries took out those missiles and then Israel [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=391.78s)]
*  conducted operations inside Iran, deep inside Iran, taking out not only Iran's air defenses, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=396.78s)]
*  but their ballistic missile production capability. So Iran was left without Hezbollah, without [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=401.78s)]
*  their ballistic missiles, without their air defenses, and then the regime in Syria, the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=407.78s)]
*  Assad regime, which had long been an ally of Tehran, collapsed. And so you've got the remnants [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=412.78s)]
*  of Hamas badly weakened without regional allies, and they had to make a deal. This all [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=417.78s)]
*  happened, Michael, really over the last few months since the fall, since Israel went on the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=423.78s)]
*  offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon. So again, I'm happy to give credit to any group of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=428.78s)]
*  people. The reality is that we can't celebrate, we can't rejoice, we can't take credit until all [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=435.78s)]
*  of the hostages are home. And as Andrea was describing, the Americans are not coming home [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=442.78s)]
*  today. There are seven Americans in captivity. We should talk about them. They won't be coming [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=447.78s)]
*  home today. Can I just note for, again, news is happening in real time. President Biden is in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=452.78s)]
*  South Carolina today. He had no publicly scheduled events on his schedule, but now the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=459.78s)]
*  president is going to deliver remarks on the ceasefire and hostage deal at 1030 a.m. Eastern [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=466.78s)]
*  from Charleston, South Carolina. And MSNBC will bring those two folks when we have that. But the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=471.78s)]
*  president now going to speak on, again, what is a historic day, but still very much in flux. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=476.78s)]
*  Jeremy, as you were speaking, we were watching images from Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=482.78s)]
*  obviously. This is an incredibly emotional day, not only for the families of these hostages, but [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=487.78s)]
*  for nation states that have watched and waited for their own people to be returned. Talk to me [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=492.78s)]
*  about the American hostages that are yet to be released, especially given that we know that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=501.78s)]
*  Phase 1 of this deal was the most solid. Phase 2, Phase 3, that is where things become more dicey. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=506.78s)]
*  Let's go over the story of the American hostages. 12 American hostages were taken on October 7. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=511.78s)]
*  45 Americans, by the way, were killed on October 7. This was an attack against the United States [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=516.78s)]
*  as much as it was an attack against all nations of the world and Israel. So 12 were taken. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=521.78s)]
*  Early on, two American women were released, and then Aviva Siegel was released. She's the wife of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=526.78s)]
*  current hostage, Keith Siegel. And then baby girl Abigail Moridan, the four-year-old young toddler, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=531.78s)]
*  was released, and she's the one that President Biden welcomed to the Oval Office. So that left [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=538.78s)]
*  eight American hostages. On September 1 of last year, Hirsch Goldberg, Poland, was murdered at [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=543.78s)]
*  point-blank range by Hamas terrorists. He was the one, 23 years old, taken from the music festival. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=548.78s)]
*  His parents, John and Rachel, known to the world because of their amazing advocacy and their [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=553.78s)]
*  advocacy for all hostages. And so that left seven hostages. We subsequently learned that several of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=558.78s)]
*  them had been killed on October 7. Omar Nutra, Itay Khan, and Gadi and Judy Haggai. And so there are [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=564.78s)]
*  three living American hostages, and you just showed them. Keith Siegel, 65 years old. Sagi Jack El-Hen, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=572.78s)]
*  36 years old, a father of three, from Kibbutz, New Roves. And Edan Alexander, a military-age male. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=579.78s)]
*  Now, Keith Siegel and Sagi Jack El-Hen will likely be released in the first group of 33 over the coming [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=586.78s)]
*  42-day period. We don't yet know the fate of Edan Alexander. The American Edan Alexander has not been [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=594.78s)]
*  listed in the first tranche because he's a military-age male. And so we have to press continuously [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=600.78s)]
*  against Hamas to fulfill their agreements here and ensure that this deal happens so that all Americans [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=607.78s)]
*  can be reunited with their family. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=614.78s)]
*  Can I follow up on that point? You referenced what happens in the next phases of this is a very [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YE9KxnHeU&t=616.78s)]
