# 'Absolutely ridiculous and inhumane': Trump blasted for calling Gaza 'Riviera of the Middle East'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM)
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York, the ranking member of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=4.24s)]
*  We will keep monitoring what the speaker is saying right now, but I want to get your reaction [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=5.24s)]
*  to what he has already said on the record and the fact that if this were to move forward, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=9.88s)]
*  this idea that President Trump has thrown out there, it would require U.S. troops, it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=15.76s)]
*  sounds like, going into Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=20.28s)]
*  At least he is not ruling that out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=22.36s)]
*  What is your reaction to all of this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=24.12s)]
*  It is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=25.6s)]
*  It is something that I think on its face is contradictory of what the presidents have [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  even said. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=35.04s)]
*  As you said, sending troops into Gaza, American troops, does not make sense. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=36.04s)]
*  Then to remove people from their homelands, you know, that seems, it's just absolutely [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=41.24s)]
*  ridiculous and incredible and inhumane in talking, not talking to any of our allies, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=49.88s)]
*  Egypt, Saudi Arabia, any of the other areas, that does not make sense. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=55.96s)]
*  So it's again a president that is talking off the top of his head, although I was concerned [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=61.32s)]
*  because it looks as though he was reading from some papers, so someone is advising him [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=69.36s)]
*  in a very bad way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=74.44s)]
*  I don't know whether that's Elon Musk or someone else in that regard, but there's very various [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  dangerous things that are taking place and coming out of his mouth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=80.6s)]
*  This is one of them, to say that the United States is going to just take over Gaza and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=84.92s)]
*  you're going to see luxury condos and things of that nature, not thinking about the group [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=89.72s)]
*  of people when they stay at homeland and how we're working together to make and have a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=96.16s)]
*  two-state solution so that we can have a real peace in the Middle East. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=100.96s)]
*  We should be talking about how we maintain the ceasefire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=104.64s)]
*  That's what we should be focused on right now, the returning of the hostages, trying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=108.36s)]
*  to make sure that Hamas is not in control of any government. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=112.44s)]
*  There's a lot of serious business that needs to be taking place right now, and we are now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  distracted from that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  That should be the conversation that he should be having with Prime Minister Netanyahu right [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=121.84s)]
*  now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=126.4s)]
*  We've got a second phase of the peace agreement that's supposed to take place, and Netanyahu [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=127.4s)]
*  has indicated some indications he may not want to continue. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=133.08s)]
*  That's the kind of serious dialogue that should be taking place between the president of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=136.8s)]
*  United States and the prime minister of Israel right now as we speak, not talking about going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=141.04s)]
*  in and taking land and sending in U.S. troops. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=146.12s)]
*  It just does not make any common sense. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=151.24s)]
*  Congressman, we have the sound now with Speaker Johnson talking about this just moments ago. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=153.8s)]
*  I want you to listen to it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=158.48s)]
*  Yesterday, I think, was greeted by surprise by many, but cheered by, I think, people all [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=160.28s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=167.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=168.76s)]
*  The Israeli area is so dangerous, and he's taking bold decisive action to try to ensure [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=169.84s)]
*  the peace of that region. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  It's a bold move, certainly, far bolder than what's been done before, but I think we've [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=176.64s)]
*  got to stand unequivocally in an unwavering manner, as the whip said, with Israel, our [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=182.04s)]
*  closest ally and friend in the Middle East. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=187.32s)]
*  I think if we could bring control of that situation and bring about a lasting peace [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  there, it would do well for everybody, not just in the region, but around the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=194.2s)]
*  It's a volatile place. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=197.44s)]
*  I think the strong and decisive move is an important step in that regard, as was noted earlier. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=199.12s)]
*  So he talks about it in very positive terms. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  I thought MAGA was almost synonymous with America first, and so we hear that then from [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  We saw a tweet from Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace posting, let's turn Gaza into Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  And of course, some of these same members were against aid for Ukraine, but they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  willing to go along with this? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=226.74s)]
*  But look, it becomes clear that some of these members, they really don't have any responsibility [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=229.12s)]
*  for themselves and the responsibility for which they took their oath of office. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=237.28s)]
*  So whatever Donald Trump says, no matter how foolish it may be, no matter how silly it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  may be, they will agree to it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=246.68s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=249.4s)]
*  They don't want to do, take care of their legislative responsibilities, because if you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=250.4s)]
*  did, many of the things that Donald Trump currently is doing is against the law. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=256.4s)]
*  It's against bills that we passed in the United States Congress. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=261.88s)]
*  And now, without even coming back to Congress, without even talking to us at all, you're [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=265.88s)]
*  going to have an individual who says that no matter what we did, no matter what laws [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  were passed, he is now the king, and so therefore he is going to determine what is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=274.35999999999996s)]
*  And as opposed to us doing our legislative responsibility, because who needs someone [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=279.84s)]
*  to be in a legislative body if you don't do your responsibility and you just do what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=286.84s)]
*  the president says without regard to making it make, whether it makes any sense or not? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=293.44s)]
*  That's what happens in Russia, by the way. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=299.44s)]
*  If you look at the Russia Parliament in proceeding, it doesn't mean anything, because the only [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=302.12s)]
*  thing that means anything is what Putin says. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=305.44s)]
*  That's what happens in China, by the way, because the dictator there is what he says, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=308.36s)]
*  not what the legislative body says. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=313.12s)]
*  There is no check and balance. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  That's just a set up to have some people in there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=317.56s)]
*  That's not who we are as the United States of America. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  That's not who the American people is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=326.04s)]
*  American people understand that we can't have an Elon Musk going into our records, getting [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=328.64s)]
*  into our privacy with a 19-year-old. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  It's national security interest to us and to everything that we stand for as members [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=337.92s)]
*  of the United States Congress and as people and citizens of the United States of America. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=343.28s)]
*  Congressman, let me ask you more about Elon Musk here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=348.76s)]
*  I know you were among House ranking members who wrote a letter to the president asking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=351.24s)]
*  for information on potential doge access to classified information in the Treasury Department. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  Can you walk us through what you're hoping to find out? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=361.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=364.0s)]
*  Look, what are they looking for and why and who are they? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=365.0s)]
*  Do they have any clearance? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=368.24s)]
*  You know, we're talking about very important and sensitive personal data and information. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=369.76s)]
*  And so you have someone who's unelected, the rich billionaire, so he's an oligarch, coming [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=375.44s)]
*  in with a 19-year-old and others that are younger, accessing private information. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=382.68s)]
*  And we've been talking about China coming in and dealing with private information and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=389.22s)]
*  now internally we're going to have this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=393.92s)]
*  What for? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=396.16s)]
*  What are they going to utilize it for? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=397.16s)]
*  What medical records are at stake? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=399.08000000000004s)]
*  Social security payments, disability payments. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  These are all private information of American citizens that this man is moving into with [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  19-year-olds who have no clearance, no information, no wine or anything of that nature. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=411.92s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  And we, as a member of the United States Congress, all of us, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=420.6s)]
*  should be standing up and speaking in one voice and say we are not going to allow that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=426.0s)]
*  to happen. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTN48xeckrM&t=431.64000000000004s)]
