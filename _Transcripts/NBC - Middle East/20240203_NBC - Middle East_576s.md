# Ex-CIA Director calls U.S. strikes against Iran’s revolutionary guard a 'clear signal'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA)
*  Now, former CIA director and MSNBC senior national security and intelligence analyst [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=0.0s)]
*  John Brennan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=5.8s)]
*  Director Brennan, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=6.8s)]
*  Before we get into the specificity of these attacks, the response that we are now hearing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=8.26s)]
*  from Iraq, I want to talk about the complexity of the decision that the Biden administration [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  had to make here, a need to respond balanced by a need to not be drawn into a larger war. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=19.28s)]
*  Well, Alicia, the U.S. government and Biden administration continues to support the presence [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=27.08s)]
*  of our troops in that area. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=34.0s)]
*  The ones that were attacked in Jordan have been there for many years, working with the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=36.32s)]
*  Jordanian government to prevent the flow of ISIS fighters in that region. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=40.0s)]
*  And so when U.S. forces are attacked and the casualties, three dead and over 50 wounded, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=44.76s)]
*  it was incumbent upon the Biden administration to be able to respond appropriately, to take [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=49.94s)]
*  away the capabilities of these proxy groups. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=55.74s)]
*  And so the Biden administration is trying to decide exactly how to balance the need [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=58.1s)]
*  to respond to these attacks, these aggressive attacks on the part of the Iranian proxies, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  without triggering a broader war. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=67.58s)]
*  And I think what they've done now is to target these areas, these sites that have been responsible [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=69.54s)]
*  for carrying out these attacks, and also the sites where the Iranian Quds Force, that's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=74.26s)]
*  the element of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that has worked with these groups for many [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=84.22s)]
*  These are Quds Force members that are embedded there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=85.74s)]
*  So it was a clear signal to Iran that the United States government is not going to tolerate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=87.46s)]
*  these attacks, but also it was an effort to try to degrade as severely as possible the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=92.22s)]
*  capabilities of these groups from carrying out further attacks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=97.38s)]
*  Mr. Director, the question we have now is what are the next steps for the administration [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=100.66s)]
*  and how do they prosecute this response with Iraq? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=107.78s)]
*  But also, as NBC News correspondents are just reporting, do that delicate dance with Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=113.46s)]
*  to bring some stability to the region. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=122.7s)]
*  You've got Secretary Blinken traveling to the Middle East tomorrow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=124.82s)]
*  He's going to also be going next week to visit Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Israel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=128.5s)]
*  What do you think the messaging from the administration is going to be to them in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=133.82s)]
*  light of what happened today? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=140.82s)]
*  Well, Michael, as you say, the Middle East is a very complex region. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=142.82s)]
*  There are a number of things happening simultaneously. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=148.14s)]
*  So Secretary Blinken is going out to the region to continue to push forward as far as seeking [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=151.06s)]
*  the ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages that Hamas continues to hold. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=155.98s)]
*  At the same time, Secretary Blinken is going to talk to leaders in the region, the Saudis [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  and others, about the need for the United States to continue to take actions to prevent [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  the Iranians from exerting its influence and continuing to provoke violence in many parts [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=169.42s)]
*  of that region. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  And so I do believe that there is going to be receptivity privately to Secretary Blinken's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=176.76s)]
*  explanation as far as what the United States is trying to do, balance the equities that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=182.94s)]
*  we have there, continuing to support the negotiations that are ongoing between Israelis and then [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=187.86s)]
*  Hamas as far as the negotiations on Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=193.66s)]
*  But at the same time, doing what we must in order to protect our troops, protect our interests [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=196.34s)]
*  and also to prevent the export of Iran's revolution basically to the rest of the region. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=201.38s)]
*  Director Brennan, Simone Sanders Townsend here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=209.82s)]
*  We just talked about the fact that today the Iranians are essentially noting that they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  did not know in advance about the attack. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=219.74s)]
*  The Americans have said that they did notify the Iranians. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  They are now saying otherwise. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=227.58s)]
*  Talk about just how, why that is a factor here in terms of, again, the United States, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=230.34s)]
*  they want to respond. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=238.02s)]
*  And again, note that the killing of Americans are not going to be tolerated. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=240.3s)]
*  But I don't think the United States government is trying to, if you will, escalate issues [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=244.22s)]
*  within the region as well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=249.22s)]
*  Talk about the why Iran noting that from their perspective they didn't know about this could [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=251.78s)]
*  potentially be a problem. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=256.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're referencing the Iraqi government, that the Iraqis are claiming that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=257.9s)]
*  they weren't notified in advance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=261.86s)]
*  Because these strikes took place in Syria as well as in Iraq. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=263.94s)]
*  And we are closely working with the Iraqi government. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=267.14000000000004s)]
*  We still have troops there, working with them to try to bring a semblance of security and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=269.22s)]
*  stability to that country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure that the Biden administration did notify the Iraqi government, given that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=275.74s)]
*  these strikes were going to take place on Iraqi territory. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=280.22s)]
*  However, this part of Western Iraq, Anbar province in that area, is really not being [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=284.06s)]
*  governed or policed by the Iraqi government. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=289.62s)]
*  So these militias are basically tribal elements that have free reign in this area. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=292.3s)]
*  It's ungoverned space. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=297.34s)]
*  And so the United States is basically saying to the Iraqi government, if you're not going [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=298.7s)]
*  to take care of this problem within your own territory, we are forced to do so and we will [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=302.26s)]
*  do so. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=308.58s)]
*  And so I think these strikes were very targeted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=309.58s)]
*  They were focused. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=311.9s)]
*  They tried to prevent any type of civilian casualties. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=312.9s)]
*  And they were directed against these proxy groups that have the capabilities to continue [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  to carry out these strikes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=319.7s)]
*  So I am confident that the United States government notified the Iraqi government in advance. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=320.82s)]
*  The Iraqis, though, I think for public purposes, are going to still criticize these strikes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=326.26s)]
*  as being a violation of Iraq's sovereignty. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=331.61999999999995s)]
*  Director Brennan, there is military might. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=334.9s)]
*  There are also other tools that the U.S. has at its disposal, intel, cyber. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  The New York Times reporting to American officials saying that the United States also conducted [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=341.9s)]
*  cyber operations against Iranian targets on Friday. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=346.38s)]
*  The decline to provide further details. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=349.5s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of what is likely happening behind the scenes? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=352.02s)]
*  The elements of this we cannot see specifically the role that the CIA may be playing? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=355.58s)]
*  Well, I do believe that there's going to be other dimensions, as you point out, are not [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=360.02s)]
*  going to be publicly visible. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=364.86s)]
*  And on the cyber front, what I think we would try to do is degrade the command and control [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=368.46s)]
*  communication systems that are in place between the Iranian government, the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=373.22s)]
*  Guard, the Quds Force, and these various groups as a way to disrupt their activities. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=378.18s)]
*  And therefore, whether or not it is elements of the intelligence community or the U.S. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  military, I think this is going to be a multidimensional effort, again, degrading the capabilities, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=388.7s)]
*  the military capabilities of these groups, but at the same time disrupting those capabilities [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=394.58s)]
*  behind the scenes that enable them to carry out these attacks. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised if there are some things that are directed against the Iranians, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=402.3s)]
*  against Iran proper. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=407.22s)]
*  But in addition to possible cyber operations, the Biden administration may decide to enact [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=409.26000000000005s)]
*  further financial sanctions against the Iranian government, given that Iran's support for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  these groups really has enabled them to carry out these attacks, just the way Iran's support [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=421.26000000000005s)]
*  to Hamas was really critical to Hamas's ability to carry out the atrocities against Israel [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=426.24s)]
*  on October 7. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  And, Director Brennan, along those lines, I do think it's notable that even just on [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=433.34s)]
*  Thursday when Secretary Austin was doing a—he had a press conference, his first big press [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=437.34s)]
*  conference since his hospitalization at the Department of Defense, he was very particular [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  not to blame Iran for the attacks that killed the three United States service members. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=450.05999999999995s)]
*  I think folks listening to this right now might say, well, why are we not being specific? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=455.17999999999995s)]
*  Why are the Americans and the folks in government not just calling the thing a thing? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=461.28s)]
*  Can you unpack that for folks? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think there has been a fair amount of blame placed on Iran by U.S. government [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=467.47999999999996s)]
*  officials. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=473.23999999999995s)]
*  President Biden, when he was asked the other day, I think on the front of the White House, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  the West Lawn, he did say Iran does bear responsibility, some responsibility for this, because if [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=477.84s)]
*  it were not for Iran's provision of weapons, ordnance, munitions, financial support and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=484.2s)]
*  other types of things, these groups would not be able to carry out these attacks. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=490.84s)]
*  Iran has been doing this for many, many years across the Middle East. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  It cultivates these relationships with these groups as a way to extend its influence and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=499.47999999999996s)]
*  to have a presence and a capability inside of Iraq, inside of Syria, inside of Yemen [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=504.44s)]
*  and other areas. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  It goes supporting the fellow Shia extremist groups, but also it provides support to various [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  Sunni Islamist groups. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=516.9599999999999s)]
*  Hamas is a Sunni group as well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=518.76s)]
*  So Iran's hand is clearly visible in this. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wIJTb00HA&t=520.7199999999999s)]
