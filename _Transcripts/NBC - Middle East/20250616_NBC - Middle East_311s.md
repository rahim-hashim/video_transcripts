# Trump vetoed Israeli proposal to assassinate Iran's supreme leader amid escalation
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg)
*  And now with us is former Israeli ambassador to the United States. That's Michael Oren. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador, for being with us. The current Israeli ambassador to the U.S., [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=5.12s)]
*  Michael Leiter, spoke about Israeli, Israel's endgame in this conflict. Let's listen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=10.08s)]
*  They need to have their nuclear weapons program dismantled. That's our endgame. This is a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=18.56s)]
*  lunatic occult, a death cult that favors mass murder, talks every day about destroying our state, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=25.44s)]
*  are not going to agree in the course of negotiations, and this is going to have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=34.72s)]
*  to be done militarily. How is Israel going to achieve this? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=38.0s)]
*  Well, good to be with you. Good afternoon. Welcome to my safe room. So far, it's quiet here. No, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=44.56s)]
*  no sirens going off at this moment. Israel achieved it by military means, tremendous [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=50.64s)]
*  pressure on the Iranian regime. I think there's also domestic pressure on the Iran regime. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=56.72s)]
*  It's a very unpopular and popular government, and people are expressing their displeasure. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=60.64s)]
*  They're also fleeing to Iran for the first time in 45 years. It's the Iran-Iraq War of the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=65.2s)]
*  early 1980s. So it's a very difficult situation for them. And Israel has been destroying these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=70.08s)]
*  rocket launchers. About a third of Iran's rocket launching arsenal was destroyed last night. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=76.48s)]
*  We were only hit by 40 rockets last night. I say that ironically because in the past, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=82.08s)]
*  we've been hit by as many as 200 or even 300 rockets. So Iran's ability to strike back [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  at Israel is also getting weaker. And there are indications now that Iran is already signaling [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=91.2s)]
*  to the United States and to Israel that it's ready to cry uncle. It's going to cry uncle to uncle [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=96.72s)]
*  Sam. And we'll go back to the negotiating table. At the end of the day, Anna, Israel can bomb nuclear [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=101.84s)]
*  sites from now until three months from now. Some of these sites are impregnable to our planes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=107.68s)]
*  At least we have small fighter planes. We don't have strategic bombers like the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  The true guarantee for ensuring that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon has to be done at the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=117.12s)]
*  negotiating table in the position of the Trump administration, which had been prior to this war, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  that Iran has to dismantle its nuclear sites and join a regional architecture for providing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=127.44s)]
*  peaceful nuclear energy to all peoples of the Middle East. And I think that's a very reasonable [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=134.8s)]
*  position on the part of the president. And I think it's one that can be realized if Israel [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=138.48s)]
*  is allowed to keep this pressure up on the Iranian regime. Ambassador President Trump has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=142.48s)]
*  reluctantly supported the Israeli mission, but isn't signing off on everything they want, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=147.28s)]
*  vetoing a plan to assassinate Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. According to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=152.08s)]
*  our reporting, President Trump reportedly opposed this plan altogether, wouldn't allow the United [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=157.52s)]
*  States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=162.32s)]
*  conflict, so Trump didn't believe it would be the appropriate thing to remove Khamenei, and he [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=166.96s)]
*  recommended against the Israelis conducting this operation. How significant is that, that President [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=172.08s)]
*  Trump refused to sign off on that plan? I think it's significant. I think President Trump is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=178.88s)]
*  signaling that he wants to contain this conflict. He doesn't want to become an all-out conflict, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=185.12s)]
*  because Ayatollah Khamenei is not just the head or supreme leader of Iran, he's the supreme [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=188.64s)]
*  shed leader. And by eliminating him, you are making this much more religious conflict than it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=194.32s)]
*  has been. And I think he wants to keep that lid on that if he can. Now, if the Iranians keep on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  killing Israeli civilians at the rate they have, and then Israel may have no choice but to respond [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=206.8s)]
*  in kind and start targeting political leaders in Iran, and the government has made that abundantly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=214.4s)]
*  clear, I think the president hopes that we're not going to get to that point. Is it possible for the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=219.2s)]
*  U.S. to continue negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program while these strikes are going on? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=223.84s)]
*  Well, I think it would be probably if talks were to resume and resume on the basis of dismantlement, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=229.52s)]
*  which the Iranians have been adamantly refusing to do that up to this point, I think that a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=238.72s)]
*  ceasefire would be possible. And I think that Israel would probably agree to that ceasefire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=244.56s)]
*  We're under duress here. This is kind of a war of attrition. To see which side calls uncle first, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  and as I mentioned earlier, the uncle is Uncle Sam, the Iranians were hoping that we'd go to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  the United States and say, okay, we give up, go back to the negotiating table and negotiate an [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=258.32s)]
*  agreement which is very close to the 2015 agreement signed by the Obama administration, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=262.4s)]
*  which did not dismantle any part of the Iranian nuclear program. Israel and the United States, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=266.64s)]
*  I think, are in lockstep in assisting on dismantlement and the enlistment of Iran [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=272.08s)]
*  in this regional nuclear peaceful energy program. Former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Ambassador [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=277.52s)]
*  Michael Oren, thank you so much for joining us and we wish you your safety. Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrE4oAbn2Mg&t=284.96s)]
