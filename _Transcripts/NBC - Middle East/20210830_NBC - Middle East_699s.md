# Historic: Watch The End Of America's Longest War
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik)
*  October 7, 2001. That was the exact date that the first U.S. strikes began against the Taliban in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=0.0s)]
*  Afghanistan, in that operation that was dubbed Enduring Freedom and that certainly endured. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=6.48s)]
*  And that brings us to another date. It's today's date, August 30, 2021, the formal end to this now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  20-year war, as the United States has fully withdrawn formally and completely from Afghanistan [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=21.28s)]
*  today. And over that ensuing time across those two decades, 2,461 American troops died in service [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=27.12s)]
*  to their country, as well as many, many Afghans. The last U.S. aircraft left Kabul airport after [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=34.56s)]
*  3 p.m. Eastern time today, which meets the deadline set by President Biden for withdrawal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  Amidst the grieving, as well as the recriminations over this deadly and at times chaotic evacuation, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  the biggest piece of all of this that everyone in America who cares about this has been considering [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=51.92s)]
*  and grieving is the 13 U.S. service members, as well as the 169 Afghans, killed in that ISIS attack, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=58.32s)]
*  that gut punch on the United States way out the door. On Sunday, the U.S. struck back in preparation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=65.12s)]
*  They struck a vehicle that was viewed at the time as an imminent ISIS threat. The Pentagon is also [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=73.04s)]
*  probing reports of civilian casualties from that strike. In terms of the process, the United States [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=77.44s)]
*  has now formally airlifted 123,000 people out as part of this. And as we await remarks from America's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=83.2s)]
*  top diplomat here in the early evening tonight, we can also tell you the top U.S. general running [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=90.48s)]
*  Mideast military operations has spoken out and honored the fallen. My heart is broken over the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=95.6s)]
*  losses we sustained three days ago. As the poem by Lawrence Binion goes, we will remember them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=103.6s)]
*  The last 18 days have been challenging. Americans can be proud of the men and women of the armed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=111.52s)]
*  forces who met these challenges head on. President Biden stood with grieving families at Dover Air [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  Force Base for that dignified transfer of the 13 U.S. service members killed in Kabul last week. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  The president and first lady also met in private with those families. And it's been noted that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=129.12s)]
*  five of those service members honored there who were killed, five of them were just 20 years old, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=134.32s)]
*  which is also roughly the age of this war that ends formally today. Now, as I mentioned to you, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=142.88s)]
*  and as Nicole was saying, because we're following this story here in multiple angles, Secretary of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=150.32s)]
*  State Blinken is prepared to come out to that lectern at the State Department for a speech that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=154.88s)]
*  was billed this hour, and we will bring it to you live. We are also hearing new in the last few [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=159.68s)]
*  moments from the White House that President Biden intends to address the nation on all this tomorrow. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=164.56s)]
*  I'm joined now by Howard Dean, former DNC chairman and Vermont governor and a presidential candidate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=169.84s)]
*  who ran against Mohawk US foreign policy, Katrina Bannon-Hill, editorial director and publisher of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  The Nation magazine and my former boss, and John Stolls, an Iraq war veteran and chairman and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=179.04s)]
*  co-founder of Vote Vets. I could start anywhere, John. I will start with you. What does it mean to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=184.88s)]
*  see this formally end today? I think it's a reflection point. It's certainly, it's been along [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=192.48s)]
*  18 days. It's been along 20 years. I think this is one of the few weeks where I can say [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=201.04s)]
*  going back to when I first went to Iraq in 2003, that this entire nation, it feels like, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  has been at war. I think what we've seen in the past 18 days is some of the strongest presidential [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=213.6s)]
*  leadership that we've seen. We've seen a president like Joe Biden relate as a father of a son. He [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=220.16s)]
*  feels died because of his experience in the war and relate to the American public in that way. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot of mixed emotions from 20 years to seeing people die this week in such heroic fashion. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=231.6s)]
*  Katrina? I think this is a moment for deep, widespread rethinking about the failed foreign [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=242.08s)]
*  policy assumptions, security assumptions that took us into Afghanistan that have contributed to 20 [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=251.84s)]
*  years of endless war, have contributed to, as the cost of war project at Brown have told us, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=258.16s)]
*  some $6.4 trillion that could have been used to build at home, to build a more secure country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=264.72s)]
*  This doesn't mean we don't have regional diplomacy. We don't help the Afghans, the women, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  others in the Middle East to stabilize the region. But I think it's a measure of how far we've come [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=277.36s)]
*  that at the nation we opposed the Iraq or Barbara Lee's position is one we marked, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=283.12s)]
*  even as she had security detail for a year. But I think it's a very important moment to take serious [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=288.8s)]
*  action. And I would suggest we think hard about cutting a defense budget that has been used to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=295.44s)]
*  transform societies when it should be used for security or a global vaccination campaign or to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  tackle inequality, climate, joblessness, and more. Yeah. And Governor Deane, as I've told viewers, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=306.48s)]
*  we're keeping an eye there on the State Department where this speech is scheduled from the Secretary [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=316.24s)]
*  of State, which is the diplomatic piece of this. As Katrina mentions, there's the military, there's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=319.76s)]
*  the diplomacy in terms of also trying to solve those problems or challenges in the region without [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=325.44s)]
*  resorting first to military force. And then there's, of course, the cost of the treasure [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=329.92s)]
*  back home. I want to put up on the screen because Nicole was just mentioning this in her coverage [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=334.08s)]
*  that there has been a lot of Washington-based criticism of the president, and certainly [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  constructive good faith criticism is a great part of democracy. But some of it has also seemed to be [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  reflexively hawkish or pin the messiness of getting out of this situation on the person getting us out [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=348.08s)]
*  when it was many other administrations that got us in and in deeper. And so for context, Governor, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=354.96s)]
*  I just want to put up support for the U.S. troop withdrawal, which is a reminder of where the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=359.2s)]
*  nation's at. You see it in August here, 49% in mid-August. It goes up over the course of time to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=362.88s)]
*  69%. And where it has lagged with regard to the Taliban taking power, it has not ever dropped far [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=374.48s)]
*  below a basic plurality or majority of Americans, Governor, who say they get it, this is tough. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=382.88s)]
*  You could see there the up and down. It's tough. Even if it means Taliban takeover, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  more people think it's time to go than to double down there. And I'm curious, Governor, what you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=395.44s)]
*  think that tells us about the gap that has been discussed but seems relevant between where the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=400.48s)]
*  secretary of state is about to speak in Washington, where this is still hotly debated and there's been [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  a lot of criminations against Biden, and the country which seems to be emphatically saying, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=410.0s)]
*  as bad as it is to have the Taliban take charge, even that, which is a bad thing, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=414.88s)]
*  is not a thing that makes them say another year or 10? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=419.92s)]
*  Well, this is complicated. I did not support the war in Iraq, George W.'s war in Iraq. I did support [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=424.88s)]
*  attacking the Taliban after Osama bin Laden killed 3,000 Americans on our own soil. However, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=432.64s)]
*  what we did was screw up just like we did in Vietnam, just like we did in Iraq, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=440.8s)]
*  just like we did in Latin America before that. Our foreign policy has never been really thought [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=445.6s)]
*  out. The problem is, it's not so much we went in, it's that we went in and then we made friends [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=450.88s)]
*  with all the most corrupt people we could possibly find. As long as they were our people, we were [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=456.88s)]
*  willing to contribute to the corruption. And so we needed to get out, and we needed not to get [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=462.56s)]
*  bogged down in what we always do. And it's a disservice to our military, I think, the civilian [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=468.88s)]
*  leadership, not Biden so much, because I do give Biden a lot of credit for getting us out. It was [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  an untenable situation. We put our military in a terrible position because the political leadership [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=479.2s)]
*  of four administrations kept doing the same old damn thing we've done for 100 years, an American [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=485.6s)]
*  foreign policy. So I give Biden a lot of credit for getting us out. I am upset that we left a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=492.0s)]
*  lot of people behind. I worked for an NGO, there's 54 of our employees and total 200, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=498.64s)]
*  including dependents, that did not get out, and we're going to have to still work to get them out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  And I'm hoping the 97 person agreement that Secretary Blinken announced yesterday, a 97 [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  country agreement that Secretary Blinken announced yesterday is going to help us get [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=514.8s)]
*  those Afghans out who are deserving of coming to the United States or some other place who helped [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=519.12s)]
*  us and helped us with democracy and helped us educate women. Those are all noble goals. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=526.24s)]
*  The problem is we doomed them from the beginning because of the way we went in and the way we [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=531.52s)]
*  political class kept sustaining the relationship and then expecting the military to fix it, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=536.72s)]
*  which was an impossible chore for them. Yeah. And John, as for the cost here and the exit, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=541.44s)]
*  I just want to play really briefly here and stay with me everybody, but I want to play [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=548.24s)]
*  the White House press secretary about where the buck stops. Take a listen. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=552.64s)]
*  What responsibility is any for these deaths? Does he think he bears? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=558.48s)]
*  Well, I think the president made clear as the secretary of state and our national security [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=562.96s)]
*  advisor made clear that we're all responsible and they feel a responsibility and the buck stops [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=566.8s)]
*  with the president. John? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=572.4s)]
*  There's so much to those comments and I think what's most important is Joe Biden relates to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=578.32s)]
*  the father who sent his son to the war and the buck stops with him. What we've seen and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=583.84s)]
*  vote that's listen, we opposed Obama's urgent into Afghanistan. Okay. We have seen four [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=588.24s)]
*  administrations punt the football on this war and it takes a leader to end it. And it's been [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=594.0s)]
*  extraordinary to see the foreign policy class of people and frankly, retired military generals that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=599.04s)]
*  don't want to own their failures and their misleading of the American public. How many [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=605.44s)]
*  times have we heard the Afghan army has turned the corner? How many times have we heard that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=609.04s)]
*  we've got the security situation under control? It was one giant Ponzi scheme that's been going [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=612.48s)]
*  on for 15 or 16 or 17 years. There was a natural John is so right. I mean, you know, we like to say, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=618.64s)]
*  we like to say we wanted to speak truth to power, but what if those in power know the truth? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=626.32s)]
*  I recommend people go and find the Afghan papers, which was based on the special inspectors report. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=631.92s)]
*  Those in power who are now trying to blame Joe Biden for the way he's ending a war, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=638.4s)]
*  which is always harder than entering a war need to be held account, need to be held to account. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=642.32s)]
*  And I fear are you giving us good time, but too often those who got it wrong are given the air [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=649.04s)]
*  time to talk to the American people and blame President Biden. In any case, I think let's hope [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=655.76s)]
*  we have a foreign policy of restraint and diplomacy and less of military interventionism [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=662.8s)]
*  and triumphalism because I love my country, but I don't think it's the indispensable nation. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=668.64s)]
*  I think it needs to work with other countries to do many things that would improve this world. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbFxMON6Ik&t=673.28s)]
