# ‘Consistency and predictability' makes peace: Ret. Army Colonel on Trump's Article 5 comments
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0)
*  Well, I think, Jack, I mean, correct me if you disagree, but there's two ways to inform [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=0.0s)]
*  next steps, right? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=5.48s)]
*  There's messaging, what you say publicly that may help your position, and there is the reality [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=6.68s)]
*  that helps you understand what the other side may do. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=13.92s)]
*  So in terms of relevant policy, how do you think Iran will look at this, and how do you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=16.72s)]
*  think Israel will look at this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, Iran knows where its fissile material is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=25.8s)]
*  Don't forget that we gave them plenty of heads up that we were going to attack. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=28.28s)]
*  They assumed for years that we were going to attack. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=32.0s)]
*  They knew where the stuff was. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=34.2s)]
*  It's only about a thousand pounds of fissile material, so it could be just about anywhere. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  So some of it's still out there, even if all of Fordow was destroyed, which it wasn't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=41.28s)]
*  It's hard to believe that those, even the weapons that we had, could get all the way [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=46.2s)]
*  down to the galleries where the material was located. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=49.2s)]
*  If you're convinced that all of the material was not obliterated, that the Iranians still [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=54.0s)]
*  have the capability and the desire to produce nuclear weapons, you're going to act in certain [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=60.74s)]
*  ways, and gathering intelligence information is going to be one of the ways you're going [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=65.6s)]
*  to do it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=69.08s)]
*  The United States intelligence apparatus and the Israeli intelligence apparatus, if they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=70.08s)]
*  don't already know where some of this stuff is, they're working really, really hard to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=75.76s)]
*  find out where the majority of it is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  The second thing to keep in mind is that this attack, more than destroying Fordow or dispersing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=82.44s)]
*  nuclear material, sent a message to Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=88.96s)]
*  This was important to Israel, sent a message to Iran that the United States is willing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=93.8s)]
*  to do just about anything to protect Israel, and that includes doing something which everybody [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=97.8s)]
*  else might perceive to be reckless. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=103.36s)]
*  The United States is going to do it anyway. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=106.2s)]
*  So Louie, we're going to NBC's Garrett Haake, who is reporting from the Netherlands. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=108.32s)]
*  You heard everything the president had to say, so within that context, what do we think [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=112.24s)]
*  this might mean for negotiations with Iran? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=116.44s)]
*  Well, Chris, according to the president, there aren't going to be any. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=119.64s)]
*  This was an interesting moment in this news conference where he basically sidestepped [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=124.44s)]
*  this very thorny issue of how do you go from a ceasefire to a negotiated settlement, a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  peace deal, some kind of discussion about what becomes of the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  From the president's perspective, at this moment, his interaction with Iran seems to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=137.88s)]
*  be basically over. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=142.32s)]
*  Listen to the way he described it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=144.28s)]
*  The way I look at it, they fought, the war's done, and I could get a statement that they're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=147.2s)]
*  not going to go nuclear. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=153.0s)]
*  We're probably going to ask for that, but they're not going to be doing it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=154.0s)]
*  But they're not going to be doing it anyway. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=157.92s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=159.88s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=161.28s)]
*  Now, maybe someday in the future we'll want that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=162.28s)]
*  But I've asked Marco, do you want to draw a... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=165.0s)]
*  I just asked him the question as we were walking on the stage, do you want to draw up a little [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=167.64s)]
*  agreement for them to sign? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=171.18s)]
*  Because I think we can get them to sign it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=172.56s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=175.48s)]
*  Chris, from the White House perspective, they spent 60 some odd days trying to negotiate [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=177.96s)]
*  with Iran on the nuclear program. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=183.4s)]
*  They feel like they got nowhere. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  And the president is basically hanging his future policy on that assumption that he makes [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=186.28s)]
*  there that Iran is done with trying to enrich uranium, done with trying to build a nuclear [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=190.4s)]
*  program of any kind. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=194.98s)]
*  Because as he said earlier today, they went through hell and they're done and over it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=196.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=202.42s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=203.62s)]
*  Garrett Haake, thank you so much for your reporting there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=204.62s)]
*  So Ned, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee was on this network just this morning. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=207.78s)]
*  He has a little different view of this, warning what he thinks Iran might do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=212.1s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=217.14s)]
*  Put yourself in the shoes of an Iranian leader, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  Do you launch a terrorist attack in London and in New York? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=223.84s)]
*  No, you'll get brutalized. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=226.56s)]
*  What you do is you behave like a boy scout. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=228.5s)]
*  You go very quiet. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=231.24s)]
*  You abide by the ceasefire. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=232.24s)]
*  And if you've set yourself up to do it, you develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=235.16s)]
*  That's really my fear right now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=238.86s)]
*  Where do you put the likelihood of that scenario versus say they've had it? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=242.0s)]
*  Well, look, Chris, I think it's hard to ascribe any sort of percentage to the possibility [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=250.02s)]
*  that Iran pursues one course or the other. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  But I think the congressman is right in the sense that it is a distinct possibility that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=259.24s)]
*  Iran now sprints towards some sort of nuclear device. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=264.98s)]
*  And I think the real concern is not that they're going to sprint towards a fully sophisticated [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=268.88s)]
*  nuclear weapon, what we would have been concerned about in the years preceding this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=273.72s)]
*  But now they have every incentive to try to gain leverage with even a potentially crude [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=279.22s)]
*  nuclear device, something that depending on the scale of destruction and depending on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=284.24s)]
*  the disposition of the enriched uranium and the centrifuges, they may be able to do in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=288.88000000000005s)]
*  relatively short order. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=293.12s)]
*  And that's a concern with all of this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  And that was the concern that so many of us had that the president was resorting to force [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  before diplomacy had run its course. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=301.48s)]
*  What we have now is not a permanent and verifiable solution to the Iranian nuclear challenge. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not verifiable in the sense that because it was done at the barrel of a gun and not [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=310.36s)]
*  with diplomacy, we don't have international weapons inspectors on the ground. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=314.04s)]
*  Iran may withdraw itself from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's not permanent in the sense that Iran, as the congressman alluded to, and as I said, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=320.76s)]
*  may well be incentivized to try to sprint towards whatever they can muster. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=326.72s)]
*  And even if it's not what they would have mustered six months ago, a year ago, it could [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=331.68s)]
*  still be something that Israel, the United States, would not want to see. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's precisely why there does have to be a diplomatic agreement with Iran going [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=341.0s)]
*  forward. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=345.64s)]
*  There can't just be an empty meeting, despite what we heard from the president this morning. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=346.64s)]
*  So Peter, what is a clearer win for Trump? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  Is NATO allies today agreeing to increase their defense spending, right, from around [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=353.72s)]
*  about 2 percent to 5 percent, giving him something he has wanted for a very long time? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  And the secretary general actually referred to him in this way when talking about Iran [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=368.68s)]
*  They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=369.68s)]
*  You know, they fight like hell. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  Let them fight for about two, three minutes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  Then it's easy to stop them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=378.36s)]
*  Daddy has to sometimes use strong language. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=380.16s)]
*  You have to use strong language. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=382.56s)]
*  Every once in a while you have to use a certain word. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=384.04s)]
*  Daddy uses strong language. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=387.0s)]
*  Whether it's that, Peter, or handing over the cash, can Trump lead this meeting legitimately [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  arguing, I have NATO where I want them? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=394.36s)]
*  Well, he is going to argue that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=397.48s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  He will take credit for the goal of a 5 percent spending on military. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  But keep in mind that it's a little less than that underneath the surface. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  For one thing, the language of the agreement suggests that allies, not necessarily all [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=411.32s)]
*  allies, will meet that 5 percent goal. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=415.48s)]
*  That's already been interpreted by Spain, for instance, to say, well, I'm not going [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=417.72s)]
*  to do this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=420.48s)]
*  We're not going to go to 5 percent. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=421.48s)]
*  And secondly, that goal is for 2035, not next year, 2035, long after Trump presumably will [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=422.88s)]
*  be not in office. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=428.24s)]
*  So I don't think a lot of these allies are necessarily all that concerned about making [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=429.6s)]
*  it to 5 percent anytime soon. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  It's also worth remembering the United States isn't at 5 percent. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=435.8s)]
*  But you know, look, it's a much friendlier summit for the president than he has had in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=438.4s)]
*  the past with NATO. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=442.96s)]
*  They are, in fact, all trying to make nice for the most part, with the exception of Spain's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=443.96s)]
*  objection to this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=447.64s)]
*  They are, in fact, praising him for the Iran strike. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=449.28s)]
*  And he is, in fact, recommitted to Article 5, which says that the United States will [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=452.88s)]
*  consider an attack against any member to be an attack on itself as well, something even [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  just earlier this week he threw into doubt. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=462.18s)]
*  Remember, this is just a year ago, the president said he would say to Russia, do whatever the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=464.36s)]
*  hell you want. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  That's his phrase with any NATO ally that didn't spend as much as he thought they ought [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  to spend on their defense. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=472.2s)]
*  So his undermining of the commitment of Article 5 has been a consistent theme of his going [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=473.36s)]
*  back years. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=478.44s)]
*  For today, at least, he's saying he's committed to it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's enough, I think, to get people through the summit without the kind of blow [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=482.24s)]
*  up they were afraid of. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=485.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think that absolutely, as always, Peter is right, Colonel, that he's gone back [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=486.72s)]
*  and forth from it depends on your definition to earlier today, he says he stands with [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=492.7s)]
*  it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=497.82s)]
*  But I want to play something longer that he said about Article 5. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=498.82s)]
*  As far as Article 5, look, when I came here, I came here because it was something I'm supposed [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=503.58s)]
*  to be doing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=512.5s)]
*  But I left here a little bit different, differently. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=513.5s)]
*  So if you're talking about an armed attack against one member of NATO as an attack against [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=516.38s)]
*  all and how the U.S. will respond to it, do you think that there is clarity for other [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=542.22s)]
*  NATO allies? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  No, because he's so inconsistent. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't think and most people don't think that our allies and even non-aligned countries [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=551.6600000000001s)]
*  who are concerned about national security affairs and not just in Europe, either in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=558.6600000000001s)]
*  the West and Pacific as well, think that they can rely on an American government led by [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=564.38s)]
*  Donald Trump because he changes his mind publicly all the time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=571.02s)]
*  If you say that you're an isolationist one week and then shortly thereafter say you're [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  committed to Article 5, that plants in people who are more clearly articulative of what [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=581.54s)]
*  their nation's objectives, national strategic objectives are. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=589.66s)]
*  It doesn't convince them, which is why countries like Japan were talking about rearming, developing [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=594.6999999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=601.02s)]
*  Why countries we are aligned with want to have nuclear weapons because they're concerned [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=603.26s)]
*  about the American commitment to come to their defense in the event that they're attacked [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=607.5s)]
*  by anybody, not just Russia. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=612.0600000000001s)]
*  You've got to be consistent. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=614.5s)]
*  Consistency and predictability is what makes for peace. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=617.34s)]
*  And when you're inconsistent, it invariably turns to conflict and violence. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUXTY5CPq0&t=620.7s)]
