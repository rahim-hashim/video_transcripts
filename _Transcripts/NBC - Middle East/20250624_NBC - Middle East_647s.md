# 'They don't know what the f--- they're doing': Trump lashes out at Israel and Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0)
*  Let's get to our reporters and analysts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News senior White House correspondent Garrett Haake is live in the Netherlands from [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=2.32s)]
*  the NATO summit. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=6.28s)]
*  NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons is in Erbil, Iraq. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=7.28s)]
*  Also with us, retired Army Major John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=12.24s)]
*  and foreign policy editor-in-chief Ravi Agrawal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=18.56s)]
*  So thank you all for being with us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=21.56s)]
*  And I should note, Ravi is also there at the Haake. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=23.6s)]
*  And Garrett, the president really sounded angry this morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ana, he's been in a lather all morning, lashing out at Israel and Iran since he's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=29.0s)]
*  been on the plane. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=35.68s)]
*  He's taken aim at congressmen from the Democratic Party and the Republican Party alike over [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=36.68s)]
*  different issues. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  But really, I think this all stems from the kind of high wire act he's been engaged in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  over the last 24 hours or so trying to first negotiate and then maintain this tenuous ceasefire [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=46.96s)]
*  between Iran and Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=52.16s)]
*  As best our reporting has indicated, the discussions about this ceasefire really started yesterday [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=54.4s)]
*  afternoon around the same time we were learning about Iran's counterattacks such as it was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=58.76s)]
*  on U.S. interests in the region. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=63.36s)]
*  The president, according to my sources, the Keir sources and others, got the Qataris involved, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=65.52s)]
*  essentially said to them, I could work on Israel if you can work on Iran. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=70.56s)]
*  And by the evening hours, he was able to announce this ceasefire on Truth Social. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=74.36s)]
*  Then came the matter of enforcing it since there was a little bit of time left between [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=78.8s)]
*  the announcement and when the ceasefire went into place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=82.16s)]
*  It became quite confusing over the course of the evening exactly when this was going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  into place, who had fired what when. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=88.72s)]
*  The president this morning trying to tamp down Israel's response to a last second Iranian [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=90.96s)]
*  strike, even calling Prime Minister Netanyahu from Air Force One to do so. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  For now, the ceasefire is holding again, Anna, but we'll be watching this closely all day [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=101.16s)]
*  long. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=105.08s)]
*  Keir, what more do we know about this call between Trump and Netanyahu on that end and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=106.08s)]
*  Israel's decision to stand down? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=111.12s)]
*  Well, you know, Anna, given what President Trump has said in public, wouldn't you like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=113.12s)]
*  to have been on that call between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu in private? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=119.8s)]
*  What we do know is what the Israeli prime minister's office said after the call. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=124.28s)]
*  And it's fascinating because the prime minister's office put out a statement that doesn't say [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=129.84s)]
*  until way down the statement that they are calling off these strikes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=135.52s)]
*  So it sort of gets into some justification. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=140.2s)]
*  The ceasefire is set for 7 a.m. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=142.72s)]
*  It says at 3 a.m. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=144.48s)]
*  Israel attacked with force in the heart of Tehran. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=146.2s)]
*  It goes on to say shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=149.16s)]
*  of missiles. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  Then it says at 7 a.m. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  The ceasefire went into effect. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  And then it says, and this is interesting, at 7.06 a.m. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  So six minutes after the ceasefire, Iran launched one missile into Israel territory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  And at 10.25 a.m., two more missiles. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  So that's about three and a half hours after the ceasefire, according to the Israelis. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  And it then says there were no casualties or damage. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=173.4s)]
*  I think one of the things, and then I should say, Anna, finally in that statement, the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  statement says following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=180.88s)]
*  Israel refrained from further attacks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=185.0s)]
*  So they called the attacks off. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=187.72s)]
*  I think Israel were very angry and upset by the hit on Beersheba where a number of Israelis [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  were killed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=194.76s)]
*  That happened before the end of the ceasefire. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=195.76s)]
*  But I think that's one of the things that really shifted thinking until that call with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=197.76s)]
*  President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  And is it clear, Keir, that Iran, as the state of Iran, actually were responsible for that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=204.32s)]
*  initial strike that was in question, whether it was in violation of the ceasefire? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, so much is not clear. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  I think we will find out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=225.0s)]
*  It's quite possible. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think what you heard President Trump saying there is that, you know, trying to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  silence your forces can be a challenge and it can take some time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=233.96s)]
*  It's not unusual for there to be strikes after a ceasefire. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=239.96s)]
*  One diplomat with knowledge of the talks tells me that, in fact, this is not, and this was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=243.68s)]
*  before the call, said that they were hoping this wouldn't be the collapse of the ceasefire. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=250.16s)]
*  That would be instead just kind of both sides getting one more opportunity before it stopped. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=254.92s)]
*  But it is fragile. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  And there's so much we haven't figured out here and hasn't been negotiated. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  Ravi, what does this moment tell us about the dynamic between Trump and Netanyahu? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, Trump is frustrated. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=271.76s)]
*  I think he wants to be a peacemaker. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=274.88s)]
*  He wants to be able to say that he has solved all of these conflicts around the world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=277.4s)]
*  And basically in conflict after conflict, he's finding that things are much harder than [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=282.08s)]
*  you would imagine, at least than he would want it to be. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=287.0s)]
*  So when we heard him sort of utter that expletive a few hours ago, I think that that was a good [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=290.12s)]
*  sign that he's unable to necessarily have every side do exactly as he says. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=296.04s)]
*  Now, as he's frustrated, I'm here at The Hague where he's expected to arrive shortly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=302.76s)]
*  And it's very interesting that in Europe, the mood is very different. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  Of course, many European leaders have been calling for more diplomacy between Iran and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=312.96s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=318.64s)]
*  They weren't happy that Israel began its attacks on Iran. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=319.64s)]
*  They also made clear to distance themselves from the U.S. attack on the Iranian nuclear [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  sites, even though they may be happy that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been set back. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=329.28s)]
*  But most of all, here in Europe, as Trump is ready to arrive here, there's really a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=335.48s)]
*  sense that leaders just don't want to get in his crosshairs. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  They want to make sure that Trump arrives and doesn't blow up the NATO summit here, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=345.48s)]
*  where the key agreement that everyone is looking to is to get European countries to agree [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=350.76s)]
*  to spend 5% of their GDPs on defense spending, get that agreement done, move on. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=356.64s)]
*  Don't let Trump blow up the summit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=362.52s)]
*  And so there was this literal blowup that we saw there with Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=364.84s)]
*  He was expressing anger with Netanyahu. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=369.4s)]
*  Then he fired off a couple of tweets. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=372.84s)]
*  Then he apparently had a phone call. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=374.4s)]
*  Netanyahu then decided to follow Trump's lead. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=375.64s)]
*  Are you surprised Netanyahu seems so receptive to Trump and his pressure on this, especially [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=378.84s)]
*  considering how apparently inflexible he's been there on Gaza? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=383.52s)]
*  I think those are two separate issues. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=389.56s)]
*  I think on Gaza, Netanyahu has felt that by and large he can get away with it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=391.44s)]
*  Yes, the world is very polarized, but crucially, there hasn't been a dip in American support [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=395.76s)]
*  and there's bipartisan support. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=402.12s)]
*  So President Biden was also largely allowing Israel to go ahead with what it has been doing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=403.76s)]
*  in Gaza despite widespread global condemnation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  So I think that's one set of issues. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=413.8s)]
*  Iran is different. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  It could be that Netanyahu feels like he's gotten as much as he could out of this situation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  He got America involved. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=423.28s)]
*  They've affected as much damage to Iran's nuclear capacity as they could have. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=425.0s)]
*  They need to let the dust settle now and see just exactly how much damage they've been [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  able to cause, especially in Fordow, and of course, take it from there. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  But again, I mean, when you zoom out a little bit with Trump being in the mood that he is [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=440.96s)]
*  right now, there are a lot of leaders here in Europe where I am who are very worried [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=446.48s)]
*  that that same sort of feeling of frustration could be taken out on NATO allies here, which [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=451.36s)]
*  would be disastrous from a European perspective if Trump decides to pull out from the alliance [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=458.4s)]
*  or if he makes any other announcements about a reduction in troop presence in Europe. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=463.76s)]
*  Major, we've seen this volley, these sort of extra hits from both Iran and Israel even [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=469.76s)]
*  after Trump's announcement last night of the ceasefire. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  Is it normal for this type of chaos and even conflicting information in the first hours [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=477.88s)]
*  of a ceasefire? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=482.56s)]
*  What's to keep things from spiraling out of control? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=483.56s)]
*  What is the key? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=486.6s)]
*  Hi, Anna. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=487.6s)]
*  Absolutely, it's, let's say, normal that there is this timeline for ending wars or stopping [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=488.6s)]
*  basic conflicts. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  If you look back at the Korean War, the Yom Kippur War, Bosnia War, even 2014 with Gaza, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  it's usually a time for operations to wind down, pull troops back, pull aircraft out [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=504.72s)]
*  of the sky. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  And this is, I wouldn't say normal. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=512.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't think there's six salvos that Iran fired at Israel last night. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=515.52s)]
*  One of those hitting just a completely civilian target, killing civilians, rightfully so, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel is mad about that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  But these are nonpartisan positions for me. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=526.08s)]
*  United States, with no loss of American life, no loss of American aircraft, assisted in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=530.36s)]
*  achieving a limited goal on Iran and then showed immense restraint when Iran attacked [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=535.2s)]
*  U.S. bases in Qatar and then negotiated basically a ceasefire very rapidly. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=539.96s)]
*  And of course, there's tension here, but we haven't even hit the 12-hour mark. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  I believe that the ceasefire will hold, and the United States was a big part of that. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=551.72s)]
*  Let me ask you a follow on that attack. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  We saw the retaliation from Iran launched towards the U.S. bases in Qatar. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=558.8s)]
*  Gosh, it seems like so long ago. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=563.64s)]
*  That would have been the lead story this morning, and here it's sort of on the back burner, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  almost feels. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think Iran chose that target, that response specifically, and even giving advance [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=571.42s)]
*  notice before launching those missiles at a U.S. base yesterday? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=578.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=581.72s)]
*  There's a lot of pride, Ana, for the Islamic regime. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=583.1600000000001s)]
*  What Israel has done to dominate their skies, the military targets they've taken out, and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=586.32s)]
*  then the American military doing only what an American bomb could do to assist achieving [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=590.72s)]
*  a nonpartisan issue of non-nuclear proliferation. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=596.52s)]
*  Iran had to do something. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=600.6s)]
*  I think it might have chosen that one because of the communication, the defenses of that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=601.6s)]
*  All 14 missiles were knocked out of the sky. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  That base was pretty much emptied, but it was more symbolic that showing their people [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=608.44s)]
*  that they responded against the United States. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=614.84s)]
*  From all senses, what we all want, we want the wars to end. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=618.5200000000001s)]
*  We want strengths shown, as in there are red lines that are red lines like nuclear proliferation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqPh0JH5j0&t=621.5200000000001s)]
