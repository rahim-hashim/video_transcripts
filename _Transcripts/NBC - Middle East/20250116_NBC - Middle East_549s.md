# 'Really don't know the fate' of any of the hostages: Father whose son was taken by Hamas
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM)
*  But I want to right now talk a little bit on the human aspect of what may or may not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=0.0s)]
*  be happening right now in the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=5.22s)]
*  And I'm talking about the fact that the Biden administration says the first phase of this [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=7.46s)]
*  deal would include the release of two Americans, Sagi Dekel-Ghen and Keith Siegel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=12.06s)]
*  Sagi Dekel-Ghen was taken from a kibbutz near the Gaza border while trying to protect his [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  family on the 7th of October. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=23.5s)]
*  He has three children, one of whom was born after he was captured. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=25.18s)]
*  With us now from Israel, Sagi's father, Jonathan Dekel-Ghen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=29.04s)]
*  Jonathan, I thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=33.7s)]
*  I'm just wondering how you and your family are doing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=37.06s)]
*  And as we wait these eternal minutes to find out what is going to be happening there, how [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  are you and your family doing? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=46.66s)]
*  Well, we simply keep doing the work on behalf of Sagi. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  But, you know, another 28 hostages from our kibbutz that still are in captivity in all [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=57.0s)]
*  of the 98. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  That includes appealing to the outgoing administration, the Biden administration, the incoming Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=65.48s)]
*  administration to keep pressure on all of the parties and not allow Hamas or Israel, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=71.64s)]
*  for that matter, the Israeli government to slip through the cracks here and really [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  hammer it home, make this happen for the good of the hostages, the good of Israel, but also [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=85.78s)]
*  for the good of two million Palestinians in Gaza who need this madness to stop. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=91.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm just wondering, I know that you've been told that your son could be among [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=99.5s)]
*  the first hostages released as part of this agreement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=103.7s)]
*  What have you been told about your son and his condition? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=106.34s)]
*  Well, before that, I think just a clarification. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=110.82s)]
*  I've certainly heard press reports about, you know, the sequencing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=113.8s)]
*  But we've our family has not received any official confirmation from the U.S. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=119.8s)]
*  administration or from the Israeli government about any of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=125.28s)]
*  So I really can't say very much in those terms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=129.84s)]
*  Honestly, like the rest of the hostages, we really don't know what Sagi's condition is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=135.68s)]
*  And your viewers may or may not understand that Hamas has never allowed the Red Cross, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=141.38s)]
*  the Red Crescent or any other international organization to visit with any of the hostages. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  So the last positive proof of life we had was from over a year ago. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=151.26s)]
*  At that time, we knew from hostages who had been released, women and children who were [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=154.98s)]
*  released in the first successful negotiation, a number of them had had seen Sagi in the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=159.7s)]
*  tunnels under Gaza. Just before they were released, they were able to tell us that he was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=166.5s)]
*  alive and wounded. But at that time, they also told us about other men from our kibbutz [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=170.66s)]
*  that they had been with in the tunnels for months. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  And we now know that many of those men were subsequently murdered by Hamas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=179.16s)]
*  So at this moment, we really don't know the fate of pretty much any of the hostages. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=185.48s)]
*  You know, it's been four hundred and sixty eight days since the October 7th massacre, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=193.16s)]
*  more than twelve hundred Israelis, men, women, children killed, massacred, more than 250 [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  people taken hostage, including your son. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=205.74s)]
*  How do you go forward day by day? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  What what keeps you and your family going? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Where's the light? Where do you find the light? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=212.62s)]
*  Not sure there is very much light right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=217.18s)]
*  The light will return when the hostages come home. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=219.22s)]
*  But what keeps me going is an image that I've had in my mind since October 8th, which is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=221.9s)]
*  Sagi entering some room or a hallway somewhere. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=226.96s)]
*  I hope and pray on his own two feet and his three little girls now, one of whom he's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  never met, run and leap into his arms. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=235.72s)]
*  And he's then able to embrace his beautiful wife. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  And we will not stop until that vision comes true for us, for other hostage families [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=243.56s)]
*  and also for those many, many hostage families whose loved ones have been murdered already, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=251.74s)]
*  but to bring them home for a burial amongst their loved ones. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=257.66s)]
*  You know, I guess there are some who may have forgotten what happened on the 7th of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=264.82s)]
*  October, others who conveniently play as if they forgotten about it, the death, the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=270.14s)]
*  pain, the suffering and certainly the pain and death and suffering that has happened [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  since that massacre. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=282.4s)]
*  What do you want all of us to know? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, look, clearly the series of events, the tragic series of events since October [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=290.0s)]
*  7th was set off by an unprecedented savage attack by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=298.94s)]
*  Israel, on our civilian communities. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  In my community alone of a little over 400 people, 59 were murdered that day, 79 were [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=310.18s)]
*  taken hostage, multiple rates and complete destruction of our civilian community. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, that's enough to sort of occupy one's mind for quite some time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  But I think the challenge for all of us, and I say this to Israeli audiences as well, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=327.98s)]
*  is not to descend into that endless cycle of hatred which got us here without right [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=333.44s)]
*  now fixing blame for how we got here over these 100 years of conflict between Arabs [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=340.44s)]
*  and Jews in the Holy Land. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  That would be victory for Hamas if what has happened over the last year and three months, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=349.88s)]
*  it just institutionalizes the hatred. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  So I hope and pray for my grandchildren and the grandchildren of my neighbors across the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=359.38s)]
*  border, even those who came to murder and loot our home, that they somehow can can [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=364.5s)]
*  grow into a better future. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=371.94s)]
*  But believe it or not, that's all predicated in getting our hostages home, which will allow [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  them for the ceasefire to come into effect and somehow begin rebuilding all of our lives [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=379.06s)]
*  in the region. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  Jonathan, you were saying that, you know, it's very difficult to find any light as of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=387.18s)]
*  right now. Do you find any hope? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you have any hope? What does hope look like for you? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  Right now, I have very, very limited needs, very limited goals. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=401.22s)]
*  It's to get Segui home, to get another 28 members of my extended kibbutz family home and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  to reunite people in Israel, of the 98 still remaining hostages. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=414.98s)]
*  Beyond that, I pray that by virtue of having completed this agreement on the Israeli [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=423.24s)]
*  side, that we can somehow, somehow begin to heal our society, which came into this war [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=430.12s)]
*  just before the massacre. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=438.68s)]
*  Very, very divided. And the only way even now, a year and three months after this war [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=440.38s)]
*  began, the only way it can even begin to start coming back together as a coherent society [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  with any measure of solidarity, the hostages have to come home and that has to proceed [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  and just be prioritized by our government. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=460.05999999999995s)]
*  But we also need the help of our friends in the States. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  For now, both the Biden and Trump administrations working hand in hand, but as of Monday, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=466.56s)]
*  the Trump administration to continue to pressure as much as necessary, both sides in this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=472.0s)]
*  conflict, including the intermediaries. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  We have faith. We've seen the energy emanating from the Trump team that has brought us to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=481.24s)]
*  this rank of peace and hostage return, but we need them to bring it home as well. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  Jonathan, let's continue our conversation. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=492.54s)]
*  I hope that we have a conversation where we have some great news to share and maybe some [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=496.02s)]
*  some celebrations to carry out within the framework of what is such so much death and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=502.98s)]
*  suffering. And, you know, just talking about your 400 extended family and the kibbutz, 59 [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=510.18s)]
*  murdered that day. But hopefully let's let's continue and let's find hope and let's find [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=516.38s)]
*  light going forward. I hope we can continue our conversation going forward in the next [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=520.96s)]
*  couple of days. Our conversation will have some good news. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn2cR2g_tLM&t=526.12s)]
