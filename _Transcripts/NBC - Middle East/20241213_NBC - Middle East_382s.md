# Breaking: New hope for ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs)
*  We begin in the Middle East, a lot happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is shuttling between Israel, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=2.0s)]
*  Egypt and Qatar tonight, trying to bridge the gaps for a ceasefire and hostage release [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=6.68s)]
*  deal in the coming days and weeks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=11.48s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has signed off on the broad outlines of a deal in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=14.16s)]
*  last couple of days, according to U.S. and Israeli sources. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=17.92s)]
*  Hamas, they say, has now agreed that Israel can stay in key Gaza corridors temporarily, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=21.6s)]
*  instead of withdrawing right away. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=28.32s)]
*  Hostages would be released, starting with women, the elderly and the sick. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=30.88s)]
*  Hamas would finally give an accounting of the remaining hostages, alive and dead, and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  would get a large number of their own prisoners released by Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=39.28s)]
*  Jake Sullivan meeting today with Israel's President Isaac Herzog before shuttling throughout [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=42.92s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  This is Secretary of State Tony Blinken making an unannounced visit today to Baghdad and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  meeting with Iraq's Prime Minister for talks about the future of Syria. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, heading back to Jordan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=58.6s)]
*  Hours before Blinken was in Turkey and spoke about what a new Syrian government could look [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  like. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=64.8s)]
*  One that is inclusive and non-sectarian. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=65.8s)]
*  One that protects the rights of minorities and women. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=70.36s)]
*  One that preserves institutions of the state and delivers services to the people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=74.4s)]
*  One that deals with any chemical weapons it may find to secure them and appropriately [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=79.6s)]
*  destroy them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=83.84s)]
*  One that rejects any alliances with extremist groups. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=85.12s)]
*  And a short time ago, President Biden is speaking virtually from the White House with the leaders [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=91.04s)]
*  of the G7. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=94.56s)]
*  Joining me now from Damascus is NBC's chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel and White [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=95.56s)]
*  House correspondent for Reuters Jeff Mason joining us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  So Richard, as these new leaders in Syria are trying to find their footing, it's so [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=102.84s)]
*  complicated as you know better than anyone, you've uncovered evidence that could prove [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  helpful in the search for American journalist Austin Tice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=112.52s)]
*  Hopefully that he's alive. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  He's been missing in Syria for more than a decade. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=118.08s)]
*  What have you found? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=120.6s)]
*  So Andrea, as you know, as you know that the Tice family well and have been following this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=124.28s)]
*  story for a long time, there have been many tips and many rumors about Tice for the last [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=128.98s)]
*  decade or so. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=134.12s)]
*  Where he might be, what his condition is, who's holding him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=135.44s)]
*  We've all heard them and followed up on some of them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=139.08s)]
*  What was different this time is I spoke to a former detainee and now that the regime [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=142.72s)]
*  here has collapsed, everyone has seen that the Syrian rebels have gone into the prisons, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  they've knocked down the doors, they're discovering files. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  This is a time of discovery here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  And this detainee who is now in Dubai says that he was in a prison, one of Assad's intelligence [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=157.9s)]
*  that he was staying directly across from Tice, from Austin Tice in a cell literally just [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=166.36s)]
*  across the corridor from him, that he saw him with his own eyes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=174.68s)]
*  And what was different about his claims from others that I've heard in the past is that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  he had an extraordinary level of detail. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=183.68s)]
*  He knew the layout of the prison. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=186.52s)]
*  He explained to me how many steps you had to take to get to the quarter, how long it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  was, where the security cameras were, where the guards position were. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=192.44s)]
*  He was there for several years and endured an extraordinary brutality there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=196.84s)]
*  He said that Austin Tice fared quite a bit better. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  So today, based on his information, we went to the scene to see what we could find out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=206.68s)]
*  We went to the location this morning, Assad's former general intelligence prison. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Ahmad said he memorized the location here and he said you had to descend 27 steps to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=219.44s)]
*  get to the right area. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=229.76s)]
*  Twenty-six and twenty-seven. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=231.76s)]
*  It all checks out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=234.76s)]
*  He said the steps would lead to a row of cells about a hundred yards long. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=237.24s)]
*  This is the tiny, exactly solitary confinement cell where Ahmad was kept with a tiny slot [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=241.64s)]
*  in the bottom and just opposite. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=249.64s)]
*  This is the cell where Tice was kept. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=252.64s)]
*  Ahmad said most of the prisoners in this wing were foreigners. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=256.64s)]
*  The calendar, counting down days. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=259.64s)]
*  Look at this hand. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=262.64s)]
*  It would have been absolutely miserable to stay here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=264.64s)]
*  Look, there's still cockroaches crawling out of holes in the walls. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=268.64s)]
*  So he says that Ahmad, the detainee now in Dubai, that he last saw Tice alive with a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=275.84s)]
*  shaved head, shaved eyebrows, which was customary for all the prisoners in that facility to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=283.84s)]
*  protect against lice. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=288.84s)]
*  Alive in July 2022, we don't know what happened to him or I don't know what happened to him [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=290.84s)]
*  after that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=297.84s)]
*  But every time there is a clue, every time there is a piece of evidence, it is also something [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=298.84s)]
*  to be hopeful for because one clue can lead to another, can lead to another. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  And I must say that facility also had a lot of doors. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  There are a lot of possibilities here to be explored, not just searching for Tice, but [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  as Syrians are looking for mass graves, they're looking for their loved ones. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to figure out what happened to people under the brutality of the Assad [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  family dynasty that lasted over half a century. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  And in fact, Richard, we're also hearing from other media reporting that the rebel leaders, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=334.24s)]
*  Jelani and his group, are trying to cooperate with the U.S. and trying to find Austin Tice. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=342.24s)]
*  Obviously, this would be a big bonus for them if they could cooperate with the U.S. at a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=347.24s)]
*  time when they're trying to get aid and trying to get the reward lifted from Jelani's head [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=351.24s)]
*  and get them delisted from the terror category. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=356.24s)]
*  You know, so a lot happening. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=359.24s)]
*  This is incredible reporting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=360.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOgB5S_qbqs&t=364.04s)]
