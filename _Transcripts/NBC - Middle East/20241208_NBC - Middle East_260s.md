# ‘A surprise how fast it’s gone’: Fmr. FBI agent reacts to stunning collapse of Syrian government
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc)
*  I want to bring in former FBI Special Agent Clint Watts. He's also an MSNBC national security analyst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=0.0s)]
*  Clint, were you surprised by how quickly rebel forces were able to roll into these major cities, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=6.24s)]
*  including Damascus? I mean, I don't want to draw too many parallels, but it's reminding me a bit [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=11.6s)]
*  of the Taliban coming into Kabul and meeting virtually no resistance. Is that similar to what [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=16.4s)]
*  happened here? And did we know that was going to be the case? It was definitely a surprise how fast [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=21.6s)]
*  this has gone. Rewind a decade. The Syrian civil war was stretching on for quite some time, and it [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=27.04s)]
*  was only because of Russian air force, Russian backing and support that Syria and the Assad regime [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=33.44s)]
*  was able to hold on. In those intervening years, when you had ISIS and al-Qaeda both pushing forward [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=39.92s)]
*  into Syria, creating the Nusra Front on the al-Qaeda side, that's what Jolani, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=47.36s)]
*  the individual that leads HDS, essentially moved from 2016 to 2017 to a more supporting and kind [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=53.36s)]
*  of building a community locally, while ISIS was more focused internationally on terrorist attacks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=61.44s)]
*  Fast forward to today, it really been pretty much a stalemate, and three or four things have happened [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=68.16s)]
*  in the last six months to one year. One, Israel really taking it to Iran, Iran being a multi-decade [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=73.6s)]
*  supporter of the Assad regime. Two, Russia being really focused on Ukraine and needing all of its [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=79.92s)]
*  military capacity there. They don't really have it now to push towards Syria. And then three, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=87.04s)]
*  the destabilization of the conflict of Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Gaza, Israel vis-a-vis Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=91.92s)]
*  It's really created this opportunity, which HDS and Jolani have really taken advantage of in a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=98.08s)]
*  sweeping way that I don't think many would have seen even two months ago. Right, the timing of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=104.48s)]
*  this. I mean, the three main backers of the Assad regime, as you mentioned, were Hezbollah, Russia, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=109.04s)]
*  and Iran, and they've all got other things to do right now. I also want to ask you, we've heard, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  you mentioned the leader of HDS, Jolani. We've heard essentially what the international community [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=118.4s)]
*  wants to hear from him, that Syria is a very pluralistic society. There are Christians, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  there are Sunni and Shia Muslims, there's even a small Jewish population. He said they want to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=127.68s)]
*  build institutions, they want to have everyone part of this government, they will allow different [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  religions, different opinions. But we've heard that from people before. Do you believe that this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=136.56s)]
*  is really the motivation, or are you concerned that this could lead to a more extreme Islamic regime? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=141.04s)]
*  I think everyone's concerned. If you went back to, say, 2014, 2013, when the split between Al-Qaeda [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=147.6s)]
*  and ISIS was happening, Jolani was Al-Qaeda's deputy in Syria. That was his job. He formed what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=154.16s)]
*  was known as a Nusra Front. It was a terrorist organization. He largely wore a mask. He didn't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  show his face even in public. Some didn't even know what he actually looked like. It wasn't until [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=165.76s)]
*  later, whenever the ISIS invasion of northern Iraq, the collapse of Al-Qaeda, that he took on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=170.64s)]
*  this different role, forming HDS. And while he has moved to be more a civil leader, trying to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=176.88s)]
*  bring in agriculture, develop an economy, really become a governor of his territory near Idlib, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=184.32s)]
*  where he was at, we should all be very worried that it will take an Islamist turn. Now, one thing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=190.64s)]
*  I would note is there are many factions in Syria that will likely battle it out with Jolani over [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=195.12s)]
*  time. This is a very unstable and fluid situation, not that different than what we saw at the fall of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Afghanistan, but also more similar maybe to Libya. If you remember, after Libya and Gaddafi were [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  toppled, there are many factions competing for power there. And it was a long time before [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=211.36s)]
*  stability, or any form of stability, if you could say, ever unfolded. So that's why you see [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=216.8s)]
*  President Netanyahu speaking today, warning that while he was happy that the Assad regime had [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=222.08s)]
*  fallen, he took a lot of credit for everything that happened, there's instability right across [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=229.12s)]
*  this border. And that could be just as dangerous or more dangerous for Israel and the region and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=233.6s)]
*  the United States over time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHMo4nLeNc&t=238.48000000000002s)]
