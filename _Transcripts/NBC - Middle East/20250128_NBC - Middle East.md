# 30,000 Palestinians return to what's left of Northern Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY)
*  For a second day, a sea of displaced Palestinians are streaming into northern Gaza, returning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=0.0s)]
*  to what's left of homes that they were forced to abandon more than a year ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=5.88s)]
*  Our NBC News team in Gaza captured these emotional scenes, crowds cheering, friends and families [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=10.28s)]
*  reunited, people describing the elation and the pain they're experiencing and their determination [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=16.72s)]
*  to never leave again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=24.2s)]
*  One man told us, two months ago I was filled with anguish, confined to the tents of shame. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=26.86s)]
*  However, I am filled with joy today as I return to the north. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=32.94s)]
*  I am returning to meet my family, returning to my house. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=37.34s)]
*  Even if it's destroyed, I will build it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=41.1s)]
*  And if they destroy it once again, I will rebuild it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  We can't give up one inch of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now from Rafa in southern Gaza is UNICEF spokesman Jonathan Kricks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=54.66s)]
*  And I just would like to ask you broadly what your experience is over these last 24, 48 [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=56.1s)]
*  hours there on the ground in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  What are you seeing and hearing? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=64.4s)]
*  Well, yesterday I was among those thousands and thousands of families of children. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=66.42s)]
*  We were actually distributing high-energy biscuits to address malnutrition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  It's very important because many young children are suffering from malnutrition in the Gaza [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=78.98s)]
*  script. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=84.34s)]
*  So we were there and it was really heartbreaking and at the same time very, very full of joy [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=85.34s)]
*  to see those people carrying, you know, they've been displaced so many times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=92.5s)]
*  They were carrying what they could, plastic bags in their hands, a backpack on their back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=97.86s)]
*  And the children, they look tired. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  You could see that they're really in need of so many things that they have been through [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  so much in the past 15 months of war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=111.74s)]
*  Now what is really important for those families is to go back to their home in the north. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=115.74s)]
*  Two hundred, three hundred thousand people, it's difficult to say, but we clearly see [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=121.78s)]
*  a massive movement of population to the north, which has been heavily impacted by the war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=127.6s)]
*  Obviously, food, medicine, clothing, shelter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=134.94s)]
*  Give us a sense right now of the scope of the humanitarian effort that is underway [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=138.98s)]
*  and what you're expecting or maybe hoping for in the coming weeks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  So what the deal is, is including 600 trucks on a daily basis that should enter the Gaza [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  Strip, both the south of Gaza and the north of Gaza. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  What UNICEF has been doing in the past week is bringing more than 350 trucks with tarpaulins, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  winter clothes, with hygiene kits. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=169.1s)]
*  Hygiene is a major challenge here in the Gaza Strip and medical supplies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=174.42s)]
*  So we have been bringing this and it's extremely important that this ceasefire lasts because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  this ceasefire is bringing, at least finally, it's bringing humanitarian aid at scale in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=186.34s)]
*  Gaza and it's also seeing the release of the hostages who can finally be reunited [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=193.74s)]
*  with their families. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  So it's extremely important that all parties are respecting the ceasefire and for it to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=200.44s)]
*  be paving the way for a lasting peace here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  I can only imagine that even with the ceasefire, the job ahead is daunting. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  It's one thing to get aid into Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=215.78s)]
*  It's another to distribute it efficiently to get it to the people who need it most. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=218.28s)]
*  Specifically, given the problem of looting, a senior UN official told the New York Times [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=223.78s)]
*  that what began as a small scale attempt here and there to seize aid, often, we should say [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  by desperately hungry Gazans, has become systemic looting by some armed criminal gangs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=233.82s)]
*  So talk about the challenges that your folks on the ground are facing and how equipped [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=240.38s)]
*  humanitarian groups are to deal with this desperate need. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=247.66s)]
*  It's a huge endeavor, but what we can say is that since the start of the ceasefire since [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=252.7s)]
*  implementation 10 days ago, what we can see is that apart from some minor incidents, there [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=261.02s)]
*  hasn't been cases of looting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=268.38s)]
*  So that's already a very big step forward. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=270.62s)]
*  Now we are still facing major challenges. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  The roads are heavily damaged by 15 months of war. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=277.18s)]
*  You have rubbles everywhere. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=282.22s)]
*  The many warehouses have been destroyed, meaning that the supplies which are entering the Gaza [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  Strip, we have to store them somewhere before distributing them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  So there are these kind of challenges. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=295.58s)]
*  It's also important to note that between 5 and 10 percent of the ammunition, the bombs [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=297.9s)]
*  which were dropped on the Gaza Strip in the past 15 months have not exploded. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=304.3s)]
*  So we have a lot of unexploded ammunition, remnants of war, which are not only a challenge [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=309.74s)]
*  for us, but it's also very dangerous for the children, especially those who are returning [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=316.54s)]
*  to the north. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=321.66s)]
*  And we are actually, as UNICEF, doing awareness raising among the families who are going back [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  to the north and the children to help protect them and prevent children to be injured by [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=328.94s)]
*  those unexploded ammunition. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=337.98s)]
*  So yes, the challenges are really immense. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROS9czMktY&t=339.34s)]
