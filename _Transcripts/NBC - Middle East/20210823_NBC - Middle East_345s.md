Video Description: U.S. Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, says he “wasn’t surprised at all” at the quick collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban takeover. He tells Lawrence O’Donnell what was shocking is “the fact that the American people didn't realize that this was inevitable when so many military people on the ground did.”

# Veteran Says End Of War In Afghanistan Was ‘Inevitable From The Very Beginning’
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw)
*  The article you wrote about this says that what we're seeing there was inevitable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=0.0s)]
*  When did you think—when did you come to believe that this was inevitable? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=6.08s)]
*  Yeah, hi, Lawrence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=9.8s)]
*  I can actually tell you the exact moment that happened. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=12.24s)]
*  So I learned Pashto in the Marine Corps, the language of southern Afghanistan, and I deployed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  to Afghanistan twice on special operation task forces. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=19.76s)]
*  And I remember the first time I was there, you know, I spoke to everyone when I was there—Afghan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=23.04s)]
*  security forces, normal everyday people, and even the Taliban. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=27.2s)]
*  And I was interviewing this Taliban guy in the Harat city penitentiary, and I asked him, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=31.68s)]
*  sir, do you know why you're here? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=36.24s)]
*  And he says, straight and firm, yes, because I was trying to kill me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=37.84s)]
*  I was trying to kill you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=42.16s)]
*  And I said, okay, and where do you think this is going to go? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=43.76s)]
*  He's like, well, you can either let me out, and I'll keep trying to kill me, or you can [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=47.04s)]
*  keep me in here, and one of these days I'm going to be out because you guys are going [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  to be gone. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=54.64s)]
*  And based on all my interactions with everyone else I've had, I saw that, you know, this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=55.84s)]
*  is when it's going to happen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=60.32000000000001s)]
*  It's inevitable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  You know, when I was there in 2014, 13 years we've been in Afghanistan, and my unit and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  me were doing absolutely everything for the Afghan forces. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=68.48s)]
*  We were doing their logistics. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=72.88s)]
*  We were getting them ammo, food, all sorts of supplies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=73.92s)]
*  And so for the idea—like, the idea that we'd stay seven years later and something [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=76.88s)]
*  would somehow change was absolutely wrong. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=79.68s)]
*  It's been inevitable for a long time, and most people who were there would say the exact [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  same thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=86.0s)]
*  How surprised were you that the Afghan army basically collapsed almost instantaneously [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  and the president fled? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=96.32s)]
*  I wasn't surprised at all. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=98.88s)]
*  In fact, the president fleeing is just iconic of what happened in Afghanistan, actually [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=100.16s)]
*  both for Americans and for Afghans. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=105.44s)]
*  The people who paid the price for this war were normal, everyday human beings both in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=107.92s)]
*  America and in Afghanistan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, we're the people who died. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=115.44s)]
*  We're the people who paid for the war. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  And the people who really made out were the elites on both sides. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, defense contractors here, politicians who used the war to get into office. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=121.68s)]
*  And then on that side, you know, there were all these commanders who would just take American [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=127.28s)]
*  money, not push the food or supplies down to their troops. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=131.44s)]
*  I don't blame the troops there at all for what happened. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=134.56s)]
*  They were under-supplied and under-fed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=136.56s)]
*  The elites made out here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=139.12s)]
*  And it's not surprising to me at all that when, you know, push came to shove, they fled. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=140.32s)]
*  And what happened in Afghanistan happens. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=145.52s)]
*  The news media attached great respect, sometimes awe and hopes, in a various succession of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=148.4s)]
*  commanders in these military operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq at different times. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=156.88s)]
*  General Petraeus comes to mind. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=163.68s)]
*  Was there ever a command change or a tactical change in Afghanistan after you served there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=165.04s)]
*  that made you think, oh, this might work? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=172.72s)]
*  No, I think that this has been inevitable from the very beginning. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=176.48s)]
*  And it was just—you know, there was a systematic institutional lie in place that was, I think, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=180.16s)]
*  perpetuated just to make sure that the American people believed that this investment in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=186.32s)]
*  Afghanistan of, you know, 20 years, almost 2,500 U.S. service members' lives, and $2.25 trillion [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=191.04s)]
*  was worth it so that we could keep staying there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=197.84s)]
*  And they're perpetuating that on the news right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=200.16s)]
*  They're getting out there and almost saying that we need to go back because they're trying to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  somehow say that it was worthwhile, the same way that they're saying that Iraq was worthwhile, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=205.44s)]
*  that the $6.4 trillion we spent over there was OK. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=210.16s)]
*  And, you know, these are the same people that refused to spend just a fraction of that amount [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=213.44s)]
*  of money right here in America building up our infrastructure. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=218.16s)]
*  And so for me, like, the real shock and surprise in this whole thing for me isn't what's happening [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=222.0s)]
*  there. It's the fact that the American people didn't realize that this was inevitable when [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=227.12s)]
*  so many military people on the ground did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=232.4s)]
*  And the reason for that is because we have been lied to over and over again about what was [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=234.72s)]
*  happening in Afghanistan, what their capabilities were, and what we were getting for that investment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=239.04s)]
*  We weren't getting anything for that investment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=243.6s)]
*  And it's a real shame that places like where I grew up in Missouri are falling apart now, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=245.84s)]
*  and they could have really used the investment instead. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=250.16s)]
*  One of the huge advantages that this evacuation has over the evacuation from Vietnam is ongoing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=253.28s)]
*  discussions with the Taliban, ongoing discussions with the other side that is allowing this to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=260.32s)]
*  proceed so far in a way that is not, you know, they're not having to evade being shot at by the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=266.64s)]
*  Taliban as they do that. That's a huge change over the way we left Vietnam. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=274.4s)]
*  Yeah, look, I hope it stays that way. It's good right now for the military service members, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  who I know are working around the clock, literally around the clock, to make sure we get as many [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=285.2s)]
*  people out as we can. And so, you know, the media is super interested in this right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=290.0s)]
*  Where was the media for the last five, 10 years for Afghanistan? They weren't there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  And my question now is, how about for the next five or 10 years? Are they going to keep a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  highlight and a spotlight on what's going on in Afghanistan so that the international community [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=303.44s)]
*  knows what's happening and can pressure the Taliban to do the right thing? Or are they [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=308.24s)]
*  just going to look at it right now and then go ahead and leave? I don't know, but I know that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=311.92s)]
*  what we need to do is keep a focus there so we can make sure to protect everyone as best we can, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=316.96s)]
*  who actually does have to stay and give them the best life possible. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3y_LZNuYw&t=321.52s)]
