# U.S. Amb. to U.N. reacts to Netanyahu’s claim of Antisemitism at U.N.
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU)
*  Joining me now is Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States Ambassador to the UN. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=0.0s)]
*  You heard his remarks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=6.32s)]
*  It was a very tough speech. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=7.8s)]
*  There is diplomacy going on behind the scenes with Secretary Blinken, but Israel's prime [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=9.88s)]
*  minister is accusing the UN of being anti-Semitic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=14.5s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Andrea, and great to be on with you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Let me just say we have raised concerns consistently of an unfair bias in the UN system as it relates [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=22.96s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=33.72s)]
*  We have, I think, an inordinate number of meetings related to Israel compared to other [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=35.58s)]
*  regions in the world where we have sometimes even more problems. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=43.32s)]
*  Sudan is an example. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I think the prime minister is right in the sense that there is an unfair focus on Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=51.12s)]
*  I will not comment on anti-Semitism. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=59.28s)]
*  I have no doubt that there are individuals in the UN system that might or among member [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=64.2s)]
*  states that that might apply to. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  I would not apply it to the entire UN system. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  As you told Tehran today, if you strike Israel, we will retaliate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=79.0s)]
*  Iran has not retaliated directly against Israel for the assassination of the Hamas leader [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=83.56s)]
*  in Tehran, in the Iranian capital, or for attacks against its proxies in Lebanon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=90.12s)]
*  How concerned are you about the threat today? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=99.48s)]
*  The president, of course, has made clear that we do not want to see the situation in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Middle East escalate. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=108.2s)]
*  We do not want to see a full blown war in the Middle East. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=110.52s)]
*  So yes, we are concerned about the situation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=114.08s)]
*  We have urged the Iranians, who have been proactively engaged with supporting anti-Israel [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=118.08s)]
*  elements, that they should cease those actions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=127.56s)]
*  But Israel has a right to self-defense, and we have been clear about Israel's right to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=132.22s)]
*  defend itself should it be directly attacked by the Iranians. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  And whether or not Secretary Blinken actually meets with Netanyahu, who was supposed to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=142.54s)]
*  be happening, it may not be happening now, but there are talks going on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  Do we know anything about this latest strike against Beirut? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  Because in the headquarters of Hezbollah, underground, which they say targeting with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  precision bombs, may have been more Hezbollah leaders. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=163.66s)]
*  There's a question about whether Nasrallah, for instance, is there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=169.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm aware of the attacks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=173.1s)]
*  I'm seeing the press reports as you are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't have any additional information on what is coming out from those attacks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=178.62s)]
*  There's a lot of talk about the U.S. proposal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=185.06s)]
*  They thought they had implicit agreement from Israel before the prime minister got here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=187.26s)]
*  Then when he got here, he talked about continuing to fire. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=193.66s)]
*  I am told by U.S. officials that they have been told by Israelis that they believe that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=196.94s)]
*  they have almost accomplished their military goals in Lebanon, that they're not going to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  go in on the ground, in other words, right now, at least as far as they're concerned, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=207.18s)]
*  that they're getting at the command and control. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=211.9s)]
*  They're trying to make it safe for those people to return to the north who have not been in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=214.22s)]
*  their homes since October 8. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  Is it possible then, as these talks continue, that they might agree to a ceasefire or a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=221.66s)]
*  pause in hostilities in the coming days? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=227.1s)]
*  Look, Andrea, that is our hope. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=229.82s)]
*  That is what we have been consistently working on for almost a year, and that is to get us [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=232.26s)]
*  to a cessation of hostilities that would allow for hostages to be returned to their families, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=238.94s)]
*  assistance to be provided directly to Palestinians in Gaza, for Israelis among the border with [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=247.18s)]
*  Lebanon to return to their homes in safety, and for Lebanese who are living on that border [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=254.86s)]
*  to return safely. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=261.54s)]
*  So those efforts continue as we speak, and we continue to be hopeful that they will bear [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=263.22s)]
*  fruit. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=269.7s)]
*  There's so much else that's been going on, the so-called speed dating by diplomats here [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=270.7s)]
*  Iran has been here with their new government. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=277.14000000000004s)]
*  We've heard what Israel said about the Iranian government in general today, but also a lot [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  of other conversations, including about the humanitarian aid efforts. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=285.3s)]
*  There is a dispute between AID officials who say that Israel is blocking aid from getting [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  into Gaza and the decision by the Secretary of State that that's not the case, because [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  that would require cutting off weapons to Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=302.5s)]
*  How do you assess whether Israel is blocking aid getting into Gaza? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=306.54s)]
*  Look, we also have engaged with the Israelis, with others on the ground to ensure that humanitarian [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=310.94s)]
*  aid gets through to the people of Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  This is the highest priority of the U.S. government, and as I've said to my colleagues on a regular [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=322.94s)]
*  basis here, we are the only country with diplomats on the ground working on this every single [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=328.26000000000005s)]
*  day. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=336.7s)]
*  Israel does have a responsibility to ensure that humanitarian assistance is allowed in, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=337.7s)]
*  and this is an issue that we raise with them on a regular basis. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  The U.N. has a special reconstruction and engagement representative who has been meeting [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=348.02s)]
*  with the Israelis on this issue on a regular basis, and we're meeting with others in the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=354.7s)]
*  region to ensure that we can get the needed humanitarian assistance on the ground to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=359.38s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YGr-aLLtqU&t=365.5s)]
