# MAGA at odds? 'Fairly obvious' Gabbard is being 'sidelined' by Trump: Former GOP Rep.
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo)
*  I want to bring in former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent and former Democratic Congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Crowley. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=4.92s)]
*  It's good to have both of you here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=5.92s)]
*  Congressman Dent, the president was asked about Americans who don't want to get involved [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=8.16s)]
*  in another war just yesterday, and here's what he said. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=12.18s)]
*  I don't want to get involved either, but I've been saying for 20 years, maybe longer, that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=16.52s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=21.28s)]
*  I've been saying it for a long time, and I think they were a few weeks away from having [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=27.12s)]
*  And they had to sign a document. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  I think they wish they signed it now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=30.28s)]
*  It was a fair deal. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  And now it's a harder thing to sign. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=33.96s)]
*  There's a lot of water over the dam. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=35.32s)]
*  But I say it very simply, Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Congressman Dent, is that answer going to be good enough for those in Trump's MAGA base [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=46.96s)]
*  who oppose a U.S. strike? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump has put himself in a real box here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=52.88s)]
*  On the one hand, he's been yapping for years about the Bush-Cheney wars in the Middle [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=57.68s)]
*  East. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  He's against the interventionism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  And on the other hand, he's been very critical of the Obama-Biden agreement, the nuclear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=64.2s)]
*  agreement with Iran. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=70.12s)]
*  And then, of course, he pulled out of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=71.12s)]
*  He's looking for a third way and cannot find one. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=73.2s)]
*  I happen to think that Trump's base, his hardcore base, is going to stick with him no matter [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=76.64s)]
*  what he does. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=81.28s)]
*  But if I were Donald Trump, I'd be much more worried about how this issue is going to dominate [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  his presidency if he does, in fact, strike. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Iran has a funny way of undermining a lot of presidencies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=91.72000000000001s)]
*  Jimmy Carter were the hostages, Ronald Reagan, Iran-Contra, George Bush in Iraq, Iran meddled [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=100.72s)]
*  Biden, the whole October 7th, was largely instigated by Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=101.72s)]
*  Getting Hamas to attack Israel is so brutally the way they did. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  So right now, I think Trump's got a real problem. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=109.56s)]
*  And he's not helping himself. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=112.24s)]
*  He needs a diplomatic way out of here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=113.44s)]
*  But he's not helping himself with these tweets about unconditional surrender, which sounds [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=115.44s)]
*  to me like regime change. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=119.8s)]
*  He's dealing with Bibi Netanyahu's persistence and Khomeini's defiance. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=122.08s)]
*  And he doesn't know how to get through this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=128.12s)]
*  And I think he's, like I said, I think his base will stick with him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=131.28s)]
*  But he's going to have a much bigger problem with the broader electorate if things don't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=134.24s)]
*  go the way he would like. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=138.56s)]
*  Well, and what is that way at this point? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=140.96s)]
*  Congressman Crowley, coming back to the clip we showed bumping in, Tucker Carlson, among [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=143.48s)]
*  others, has been very vocally against the U.S. getting involved militarily with Iran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  And the president actually talked about Carlson in the Oval Office. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=153.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=157.8s)]
*  My supporters are for me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=158.8s)]
*  My supporters are America first. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=162.2s)]
*  They make America great again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=164.12s)]
*  My supporters don't want to see Iran have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Tucker's a nice guy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=169.96s)]
*  He called and apologized the other day. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=170.96s)]
*  If they think that it's OK for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, then they should oppose [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=177.96s)]
*  But nobody thinks it's OK. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=178.96s)]
*  Axios lays out the political dilemma this way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  MAGA's most outspoken isolationists, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, Rep. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=183.08s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, have warned that joining the war would betray Trump's legacy and potentially [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=187.84s)]
*  destroy his presidency. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=192.24s)]
*  Pro-Israel hardliners Laura Loomer, Mark Levin, Senator Tom Cotton argue that nothing would [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=194.32s)]
*  be more America first than striking a regime that chants death to America. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=199.08s)]
*  Congressman Crowley, what kind of political predicament does this put the president in? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, clearly, the president was moving towards diplomatic solution with Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  He wanted talks with Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=216.4s)]
*  He wanted to supposedly have a new deal with Iran. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  And all of a sudden, that changed overnight with the attacks by Israel, by Netanyahu, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=221.36s)]
*  who seems to be pulling the president by the nose here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  As was stated, the president is called for unconditional surrender. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=229.88s)]
*  You call for unconditional surrender when you're at war. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=235.0s)]
*  That doesn't, you know, you just don't do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=239.04s)]
*  And you're taking ownership here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  So I do think the president would be smart and wise to really engage Congress here, to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=243.44s)]
*  kind of spread this out a little bit. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=248.76s)]
*  He's saying that he owns this decision. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=250.72s)]
*  Only he can make this decision. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  No one knows what he's going to do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=254.9s)]
*  I think he'd be smarter if he were to spread this out a bit and get some advice from folks [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=256.82s)]
*  who have been through these things before. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=260.9s)]
*  Should politics play big in his decision making? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=263.22s)]
*  Well, look, I think politics is always at play. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=266.46s)]
*  I don't think it ought to. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=270.06s)]
*  I think what we're dealing with here is life and death. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=271.3s)]
*  We've been involved in war in the Middle East for almost 40 years, maybe 30 years, at least. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=275.54s)]
*  I think there was a bit of fatigue that is setting in, certainly with the American people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  These endless wars, as the president talked about, it's counter to everything he'd said [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  politically. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  He was going to end the endless wars. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  And yet here he's inching towards another engagement in the very region that we're talking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=293.86s)]
*  about, the Middle East. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=298.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congressman Dent, adding to the MAGA division here is Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=299.94s)]
*  And we've reported she's been sidelined now after she had tweeted out a video warning [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  against action in Iran. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=307.58s)]
*  And she testified in March that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=309.06s)]
*  How significant is it to have the director of national intelligence on the outs in early [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=312.7s)]
*  administration? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, it signals to me that, let's say Tulsi Gabbard, Bannon Carlson, I'll say the pro-Russia [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  wing of the Trump base is also against any type of a military intervention here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=329.46s)]
*  I think that's pretty significant. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=336.06s)]
*  So I think it seems fairly obvious that she's being sidelined right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=338.18s)]
*  And I fear that right now the president is not getting the type of sage advice from his [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  inner circle about how to deal with this crisis. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=350.46s)]
*  I don't know that the team he has assembled can really help him. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=353.82s)]
*  I mean, I just read a great piece by Kareem Sajjapour and The Economist, fantastic piece [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=356.78s)]
*  about all the implications. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=361.38s)]
*  They need somebody like him in there giving them guidance about how to navigate this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think he's getting that type of sober, unvarnished advice, going through all [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=367.58s)]
*  the scenarios, the knowns and the unknowns, what the second and third order effects are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=372.7s)]
*  going to be. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=376.98s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=377.86s)]
*  It's not coming from his team. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=379.06s)]
*  So it seems. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=381.5s)]
*  And so he's out there winging it on his own, making a lot of statements about how [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  unpredictable he is and he doesn't know what he's going to do. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=386.18s)]
*  I don't think any of this is helping. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=389.14s)]
*  This is a time for them to be quiet and start having serious conversations internally about [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=390.58s)]
*  the best course of action instead of all this nonsensical tweeting. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=396.46s)]
*  Former Congressman Charlie Dent and Joseph Crowley, thank you both for the conversation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71DCWtdgiOo&t=400.09999999999997s)]
