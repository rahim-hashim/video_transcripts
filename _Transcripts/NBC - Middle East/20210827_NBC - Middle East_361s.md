# New Urgency ‘To Move As Quickly As Possible’ In Afghanistan Evacuation
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U)
*  Jonathan, the White House preface briefing today gives the clear sense that the administration is focused on those evacuations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=0.0s)]
*  What are you hearing from your sources inside the administration? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=6.48s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt Alicia the senior officials that I've spoken to say there's that much more urgency now to move as quickly as [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=11.76s)]
*  possible in the light of the terrible terror attack yesterday and the warnings and threats that another one could happen again in the days ahead [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=17.36s)]
*  That August 31st deadline looms. We've heard from the president. He wants to stick to it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=24.84s)]
*  He believes that they can get the Americans out by that date and most of our Afghan allies now [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=28.8s)]
*  He's asked for contingency plans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=34.78s)]
*  So he said that if needed, you know that deadline could be extended a couple of days if required [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  But they'd really prefer not to again [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Especially in light of yesterday's attack which just underscores the danger for any American [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=44.04s)]
*  Including American members of the American military who were there past the deadline [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=49.68s)]
*  the Taliban who are somewhat of our unlikely allies right now trying to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=53.64s)]
*  Trying to expedite the evacuations they made clear they didn't want an extension and certainly ISIS K [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=58.2s)]
*  There's terrorist terror group. They're not going to adhere to any deadline either and they've made that very clear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=64.1s)]
*  We saw from the president yesterday just how much this weighs on him [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=69.18s)]
*  Emotional at times in that speech coming under withering criticism for the way this evacuation operation has been conducted [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=73.44s)]
*  But we also heard a resolve a resolve to hunt down [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=80.4s)]
*  And get those who are responsible and we heard from White House press secretary Jen Psaki [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=84.0s)]
*  She added to what he meant. She said and I paraphrase those people shouldn't be alive on this earth anymore [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=88.16s)]
*  So that's certainly our stark warning from the president here [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  And she also was asked about the strange bedfellows of the Taliban and she said look we have to be realistic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=97.36s)]
*  Sometimes we have to cooperate with those we don't really get along with right Evelyn to that point [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=102.24s)]
*  NBC News is reporting that the Taliban's head of security was designated as a terrorist by the US government ten years ago [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  There's a five million dollar reward for information that could lead to his capture [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=113.0s)]
*  Can you walk us through what the US Taliban relationship looks like right now? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=116.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think it sounds [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=121.72s)]
*  Alicia it is exactly as Jonathan sketched out, you know, it's a it's a relationship of convenience right now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=124.16s)]
*  They have some something of control over Kabul and most of Afghanistan [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  Although I say right now because that could change and so the US government is in a position to work with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  The people who have the most power and leverage on the ground, which is unfortunately the Taliban. We have really no choice [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=142.08s)]
*  I will say though that they also don't control all the people who are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=148.32s)]
*  nominally notionally Taliban and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=153.16s)]
*  I heard another report earlier today that somewhere some some Taliban [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=155.68s)]
*  Official mentioned that they regretted releasing the prisoners when they got into Kabul and on to Bagram base [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=160.44s)]
*  Because of course many of those were kind of Isis and Al Qaeda pardoned fighters [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=166.84s)]
*  I'm sure they're regretting it and they will continue to regret it and there will be some kind of small-scale [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=171.12s)]
*  If not large-scale civil war that continues to be waged in Afghanistan after we leave right now [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=175.84s)]
*  Focuses on getting everyone out of course Greg [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  I was I was struck by something that General McKenzie said yesterday of the Taliban quote. It's not what they say [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=184.36s)]
*  It's what they do. How tenuous is this relationship? Oh [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=190.1s)]
*  It's absolutely very tenuous [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=194.6s)]
*  The Taliban are effectively providing airport security [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=197.48s)]
*  General McKenzie also said the Taliban is doing some checks that are pretty good other checks not so good [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=202.72s)]
*  We've seen reports where the Taliban were effectively harassing people, but they're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=209.64s)]
*  Having to make the they're deciding who gets through and who doesn't and the US is trying to work with them [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=215.48s)]
*  They're in still in daily contact. There were questions about did the Taliban maybe let this bomber come through [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=222.68s)]
*  General McKenzie said he had no evidence to that effect the Taliban do want the Americans out of there [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=230.16s)]
*  But they also want a relationship with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=236.32s)]
*  certainly Western countries [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=239.72s)]
*  Looks like they want embassies to stay open and maybe even want the US to keep its embassy open [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=241.72s)]
*  The US hasn't made a decision one way or another on that but there is this weird symbiotic relationship [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=248.24s)]
*  And from what we're seeing this week, it's obviously related to the withdrawal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  But there's also a sense that they may have some relationship that will carry on after the last plane goes wheels up [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=258.76s)]
*  Evelyn I worry that I cut you off a moment ago [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=266.76s)]
*  So if there was a second part to that thought I encourage you to include it [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=269.1s)]
*  But I do given the the context that you have all just given us about this relationship [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=272.82s)]
*  I want to return to the report about the US providing a list of names to evacuate to the Taliban [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  This one quote stood out to me [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  Basically, they just put all those Afghans on a kill list said one defense official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=284.64s)]
*  To discuss a sensitive topic. It's just appalling and shocking and makes you feel unclean [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  Your sense of why they did this [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think that they felt like it was it was the only way they knew when they were negotiating [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=300.12s)]
*  To try to get people through but I would agree that it was a really risky proposition and I'm in touch with people [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=305.52s)]
*  Afghans and others in Kabul right now who are either trying to get out or trying to help others get out and I know that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=311.76s)]
*  There's now an effort underway to try to remove some names [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=317.88s)]
*  as they're getting people in that we don't really want to give the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=321.48s)]
*  Taliban all the information about the people that we are taking out because there is no hundred percent trust and certainly our military our [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=326.68s)]
*  Government officials and the you know, the volunteers who are helping get people out don't trust the Taliban [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1r6B_rq1U&t=334.32s)]
