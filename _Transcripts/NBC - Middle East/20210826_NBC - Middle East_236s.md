# Three Marines Injured In Attack At Kabul Airport
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA)
*  What do you have? What is the latest? Are there any Americans injured? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, we now know from U.S. military officials there were three, at least three Marines who [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  were injured in this attack. Now, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby tweeted earlier [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=11.8s)]
*  that there were reports of U.S. casualties and Afghan casualties. Remember, in this case, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=16.48s)]
*  the U.S. military considers the word casualty could be injured or killed here. So we don't [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=21.44s)]
*  know anything beyond that. We are, as Richard was saying, seeing media, social media, videos [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=26.36s)]
*  of what appear to be Afghan civilians injured in this as well. And it's important to point out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=32.88s)]
*  here what we know so far is this complex attack included at least two explosions. So the one that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=39.44s)]
*  injured the U.S. Marines was over at the Abbey Gate. There has been a U.S. military presence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=46.72s)]
*  at that gate for the past week or so. They have been helping to keep the crowds back to a certain [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=52.56s)]
*  extent, but also to allow people to come through that gate, primarily Americans, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  third-country nationals, and Afghans. There's also been a consular presence at that gate at [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=63.0s)]
*  times to help the U.S. Marines so they know who they can let through or not. The second explosion [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=69.0s)]
*  which, as Richard was explaining, is very close by. You can walk it. It's such a close distance. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=77.52s)]
*  It's a little unclear still how many people may have been around at that explosion location. At [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=84.08s)]
*  the Abbey Gate, there have been crowds outside of these gates for the past week or so, at times large [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=92.08s)]
*  and even potentially unruly crowds. That's presented a real security concern for U.S. officials. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=97.24s)]
*  They've been very worried about a threat from ISIS-K, which is the ISIS affiliate there in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan. They had specific intelligence that ISIS was trying to target some of those gates and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=108.4s)]
*  target Americans who may be trying to go through them to get on these evacuation flights. As you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  mentioned, Andrea, there still is not a firm sense of who is behind these attacks at this point, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=119.92s)]
*  but all signs are pointing to ISIS. ISIS-K, of course, is, as we've been pointing out, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=125.8s)]
*  also an adversary of the Taliban. Courtney, do you know whether flights were taking off [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=134.72s)]
*  during or in the aftermath of these explosions? That's something else that we're trying to get [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=139.96s)]
*  to. There are some reports that flights were still able to take off in the midst of all of this, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=147.16s)]
*  but we've been also... The entire evacuation operation has been hampered by this security [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=154.36s)]
*  threat. There's been an ISIS threat for about a week now, but it accelerated and it was ramped up [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=160.52s)]
*  overnight, leading to, as you all know, Andrea, the U.S. Embassy there telling Americans not to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=167.16s)]
*  come to the gates, not to stay away from the airport because of this threat. As the gates [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  were shut down, they weren't letting people through. We were having a difficult time getting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=177.8s)]
*  a sense of how many flights may still have been landing and taking off. The evacuation efforts [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=182.92s)]
*  have really been on a roll the past three days. They've been getting thousands of people out [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  every single day on a combination of U.S. military flights and charter aircraft, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=190.92s)]
*  but the military and the White House were really relying on that momentum to continue through these [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  next several days in order to meet that August 31st deadline. With this attack at the airport today, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=202.04s)]
*  it's not clear if they will be able to maintain that same throughput that they've had over the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=209.0s)]
*  last 72 hours or so, Andrea. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG4H0aFLKWA&t=214.12s)]
