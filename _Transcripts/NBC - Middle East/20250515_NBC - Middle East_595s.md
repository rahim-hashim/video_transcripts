# Trump talks big deals in the Middle East with prices set to rise in the U.S.
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE)
*  It is day 116 of the second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, the CFO of Walmart, one of the biggest retailers in the world, announced that price [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=4.0s)]
*  hikes caused by Trump's tariffs could start later this month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  As the Washington Post pointed out today, the company has historically performed well [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=13.0s)]
*  in uncertain times and is seen as a bellwether for the health of American consumers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=17.14s)]
*  And a new report from the New York Times points out that American consumers are already feeling [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=21.94s)]
*  the strain of the economy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  It says this, it says that Americans are spending more slowly since Trump rolled out his tariffs, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=28.94s)]
*  cutting back on travel, snacks, even doing fewer loads of laundry to save money. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=33.58s)]
*  That says JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon says there still could be a recession because of the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=38.74s)]
*  fallout from Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=43.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is in Abu Dhabi for the final leg of his Middle East trip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=45.14s)]
*  Earlier in Qatar, he talked about a package of deals the U.S. just made with that country [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  without offering much detail. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=54.38s)]
*  Trump also said the U.S. is close to a nuclear deal with Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=56.66s)]
*  I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  There's two steps. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  There's a very, very nice step, and there's a violent step, violence like people haven't [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  seen before. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=72.66s)]
*  And I don't, I hope we're not going to have to do this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=74.42s)]
*  I don't want to do the second step. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=77.5s)]
*  We're in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=79.42s)]
*  And if we do that, it'll be fantastic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=85.46s)]
*  With that, let's bring in our leadoff panel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=89.74s)]
*  Peter Baker, Chief White House correspondent for the New York Times. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=91.66s)]
*  Amna Nawaz, co-anchor of PBS NewsHour and MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=94.5s)]
*  And David Drucker, senior writer at The Dispatch. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  We're going to have to get David at the table, folks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=101.58s)]
*  Amna, I'm going to start with you, and I want to start with the Middle East. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=104.1s)]
*  Because Donald Trump says that a nuclear deal with Iran is close. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=108.2s)]
*  Iran is disputing that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  They say that there are still some gaps. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  But part of the reason that Donald Trump pulled out from the last nuclear deal that was in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=116.18s)]
*  place that President Obama negotiated was over the concerns of countries like Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=120.62s)]
*  But what has changed, because it's my understanding Israel still has those concerns. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=125.94s)]
*  So what is new here? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=129.62s)]
*  Well, we know that President Trump wanted to get a deal done. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=130.9s)]
*  We know it was a priority in the first administration as well. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=133.66s)]
*  But as you noted, he walked away from that 2015 deal, largely because it was something [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=135.58s)]
*  the Obama administration had drafted. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=139.46s)]
*  What happens now is basically they're getting close to a deal. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  And I will say people who are watching these talks unfold have noted that there's been [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  a series of meetings between the two countries mediated by Qatar and others. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=149.42s)]
*  Says that there's interest, says that there's intent, that's a good thing for getting towards [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  some kind of a deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  The gap has always been this, that the U.S. has taken a maximalist position and said there [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=158.54s)]
*  has to be absolutely a halt to all of the uranium enrichment, not even for civilian [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=162.98s)]
*  use. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=168.1s)]
*  And as always maintained, we need to be able to continue to enrich at a lower grade for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=169.14s)]
*  civilian nuclear use, that they're never going to abandon that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=173.18s)]
*  The question now is what happens in the details of these deals? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=176.1s)]
*  Is this something that both sides can actually make concessions on and get to a deal which [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=179.14s)]
*  would be good for the region? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=183.42s)]
*  As you note, though, we've seen an increasing trend now with President Trump where he seems [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  to be cutting Israel out of the loop on a number of key decisions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  The Iran talks for one meeting with the Syrian leader for another, halting strikes on the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=192.54s)]
*  Houthis for a third. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=197.9s)]
*  That's showing some daylight now between Netanyahu and Trump that we haven't seen before. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Peter, and I have to wonder if that daylight means other things are afoot in that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=204.3s)]
*  relationship. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=209.26s)]
*  The top Iranian officials said that they would, and let me get this right, they would give [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=210.26s)]
*  up highly enriched uranium. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=215.3s)]
*  So that is, let's just be clear for folks at home, that you need highly enriched uranium [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  to make nuclear weapons. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  But there are some disputes about what levels and whatnot and what Iran's capabilities [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=224.02s)]
*  currently are. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=227.66s)]
*  But that still sounds like the Obama deal. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=229.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it does actually. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=231.82s)]
*  That's the real question here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  And it wouldn't surprise a lot of people if Trump ultimately negotiated something pretty [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=234.3s)]
*  close to what Obama did but simply puts his name on it and says it's a good deal because [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=238.78s)]
*  I negotiated. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=241.98s)]
*  We've seen that before plenty of times. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=242.98s)]
*  It's worth remembering that two of the criticisms he had of the Obama deal were not even just [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=245.26s)]
*  about the nuclear aspect of it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=249.5s)]
*  His criticisms were that he did nothing to restrain Iran from using these proxies around [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=251.1s)]
*  the region for terrorism. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=256.1s)]
*  And the other was ballistic missiles. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=258.34s)]
*  And so the question a lot of people are going to be watching is does this deal deal with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  these two other questions? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=263.38s)]
*  Because he said if you didn't have those two things in the Obama deal, it was a useless [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=264.38s)]
*  deal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=267.3s)]
*  Well, will he then take it to the next level? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=268.3s)]
*  There's no sign that Iran wants to trade away those two issues. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=269.62s)]
*  I think it's also important to note that the last time there was a deal in place, it took [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=272.58s)]
*  years to negotiate that deal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=275.98s)]
*  Now am I supposed to believe Steve Wittkopf has negotiated something better in less than [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=277.7s)]
*  100 days? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=281.58s)]
*  Maybe, honey, I am. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=282.58s)]
*  Let me just talk about the CEOs for a second. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=284.38s)]
*  And David, I'm going to go to you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=287.46s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of CEOs on this trip with the president after the murder of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=288.85999999999996s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=295.17999999999995s)]
*  A lot of the businesses shunned Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=297.06s)]
*  They did not attend that investment conference. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm wondering if you think what is coming out of this trip, what we're hearing from [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=302.17999999999995s)]
*  the president, is in fact a big shift for how Republicans deal with the Middle East [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=307.46s)]
*  and then how much this move that frankly that Donald Trump is seeming to take Republicans [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=312.38s)]
*  into a different direction. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=317.26s)]
*  How much do their constituents care about this? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=318.58s)]
*  Well, look, I don't know how much Republican voters care about this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=321.02s)]
*  I would say that this reflects where Donald Trump was in his first term. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=325.14s)]
*  He aligned the U.S. close with Saudi Arabia, which in and of itself was nothing new. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=329.94s)]
*  The U.S. has long been closely aligned with Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump used this alliance [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=335.74s)]
*  to box in Iran and try and stop the Iranians' attempt at regional hegemony in the Middle [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=340.98s)]
*  East. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=350.18s)]
*  And so this is not that much different. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=351.18s)]
*  You know, I think the key is here is what the president's after. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  In the first term, the idea that Saudi Arabia would make peace with Israel and possibly [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=358.5s)]
*  join the Abraham Accords was not on the table. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=362.74s)]
*  The Abraham Accords did not yet exist. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=365.54s)]
*  That is on the table this time around. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  And we're seeing the president now try to deal with Iran. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=369.54s)]
*  And as Peter alluded to, you know, the question is here, is the president going to play hardball [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=374.62s)]
*  with Iran and make any deal contingent upon Iran ceasing its malign activities, not just [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  in the Middle East but around the world, in addition to being very clear that weapons-grade [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=388.62s)]
*  is not allowed and there's going to be a strong inspections regime. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=396.06s)]
*  And those are the questions we need to answer in order to know how successful this sort [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=401.02s)]
*  of deal is going to be. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=406.18s)]
*  But if you're looking at whether or not this is different for a Republican administration, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=407.22s)]
*  it's really not. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=413.74s)]
*  And we can go back to at least George Herbert Walker Bush to know that the Republican administrations [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=414.74s)]
*  have long been aligned with Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, particularly in dealing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=421.22s)]
*  with the malign actors, sponsors of state terrorism, state sponsors of terrorism in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=426.18s)]
*  the region to try and deal with that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  So that in and of itself is nothing new. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=434.54s)]
*  Well, you know, David makes an important point. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=436.66s)]
*  This point about the Abraham Accords. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=439.74s)]
*  Sure, the Abraham Accords is the first time around. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=441.26000000000005s)]
*  They had not yet happened yet. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=444.06s)]
*  But now we're in a very different position given the state of the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=445.22s)]
*  It's my understanding that the Abraham Accords, as it was, is not currently on the table unless [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=453.18s)]
*  Israel decides to take a different tact with how they are treating Palestinians and the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=458.82000000000005s)]
*  bombing within the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think Israel is there yet. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=465.38000000000005s)]
*  Well, the Saudi decision to normalize relations with Israel, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=466.62s)]
*  Salman has made clear, will not happen until there is a ceasefire in Gaza and until there's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=472.02s)]
*  some kind of credible plan for Palestinian statehood on the table. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=476.94s)]
*  Those are things that Netanyahu has roundly rejected both over time and recently. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=480.46s)]
*  And this is something that, you know, MBS, as he's known, the de facto leader in Saudi [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  Arabia, has basically drawn as a line for himself. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=488.12s)]
*  He's under domestic pressure to try to be able to say this is something that we need. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=491.06s)]
*  This is something we have to see. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  And so in order for the Trump administration to see through the ultimate goal here, which [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=496.02s)]
*  is normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel, the two largest economies and the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=500.36s)]
*  largest militaries in the Middle East, they need to be able to see through some kind of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=505.32s)]
*  plan for Gaza. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=509.2s)]
*  Let's talk about the jet, Peter. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=511.76s)]
*  Donald Trump would like to accept a jet from the Qataris. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=515.4s)]
*  Democrats say they want to force a vote to actually block Middle East arms sales because [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=519.64s)]
*  of it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=523.32s)]
*  Is this going to go anywhere? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=524.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, obviously Democrats don't have the power to overrule Republicans if [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=525.32s)]
*  Republicans stick together, but there are Republicans who are uneasy about this. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  This is, remember, a country that just a few years ago Donald Trump said was a big funder [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=532.76s)]
*  of terrorism. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  Qatar plays both sides of the fence. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  They're friendly with Iran. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=539.76s)]
*  They're friendly with Hamas. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=541.04s)]
*  Obviously, they've been our broker, our intermediary with Hamas during the Biden administration [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=542.04s)]
*  when they were doing negotiations trying to settle the Gaza war. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  So Qatar's a complicated friend, and it's one that's been important to the United States. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  At the same time, you know, accepting a gift of this sort from them makes even Republicans [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=554.6s)]
*  feel uncomfortable. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=558.96s)]
*  The question is whether they're willing to actually stand up to Trump over it or whether [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=559.96s)]
*  they're willing to say, let's just wait and see what happens. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  You heard, I think it was John Thune who said the other day, let's actually wait and see. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=565.84s)]
*  It hasn't actually been announced yet. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  We won't see the details of it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=569.96s)]
*  Let's not get ahead of things. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=571.32s)]
*  But it's not something the Republicans are thrilled about, honestly. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGdoUIH4JnE&t=572.5600000000001s)]
