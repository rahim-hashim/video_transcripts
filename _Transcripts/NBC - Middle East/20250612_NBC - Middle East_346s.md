# Israeli statement suggests more strikes on Iran to come
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw)
*  And we are closely following, as I started the show, talking about breaking news tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  Out of the Middle East, the Israeli military has begun launching airstrikes against Iran, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=4.5s)]
*  a dramatic escalation that has increased the chances of all-out war in the region. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=8.34s)]
*  As of right now, it is unclear exactly how many cities and targets inside Iran have been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=13.74s)]
*  hit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=17.54s)]
*  If we learn more, we will bring that to you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=18.54s)]
*  But here is just some of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=20.12s)]
*  Now as Prime Minister, I've made it clear time and again, Israel will never allow those [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=25.3s)]
*  who call for our annihilation to develop the means to achieve that goal. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=31.86s)]
*  Tonight, Israel backs those words with action. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=36.5s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=40.5s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponization program. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=44.0s)]
*  We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=51.64s)]
*  We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=56.52s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=59.88s)]
*  These strikes come just days after President Trump reportedly warned Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=66.32s)]
*  Netanyahu not to launch attacks against Iran as the United States attempts to reach a nuclear [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=70.36s)]
*  deal with Tehran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=75.02s)]
*  Joining me now is NBC News Pentagon correspondent Courtney Kuby and former Deputy National Security [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=76.76s)]
*  Advisor under President Obama, Ben Rhodes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=80.84s)]
*  Let me start with you, Courtney. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=83.64s)]
*  I will ask Ben about this too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=85.64s)]
*  I've written a lot of these statements. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=88.2s)]
*  I'm very struck. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=89.76s)]
*  This statement by Secretary Rubio strikes me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=90.76s)]
*  It reads like they're saying we had nothing to do with this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  We don't want to be perceived as having anything to do with this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And it's hard to tell if they even knew about it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=100.5s)]
*  But from people you've talked to, I mean in the last 15 minutes, because this news is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=102.68s)]
*  just breaking, what have you learned? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=106.72s)]
*  Yeah, the Trump administration definitely knew this was coming. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=108.92s)]
*  I think we're working through exactly how much fidelity, but it's very clear that they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=112.32s)]
*  knew something was coming. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  And I think they knew a lot more about it than we would realize. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=117.74s)]
*  The point of that story, of that statement, and the reason that U.S. officials are so [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=121.64s)]
*  quick to say that the United States had no involvement in this, and that includes kinetic [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=126.22s)]
*  like strikes, but also support. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=130.42s)]
*  There was no aerial refueling of Israeli aircraft. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=134.8s)]
*  There was no intelligence support or sharing for this mission. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Not even U.S. aircraft or assets jamming any kind of Iranian air defenses on the ground. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=143.56s)]
*  No support by the United States. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=147.76s)]
*  That is so critical here because that is the U.S. effort to ensure that Iran doesn't take [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=149.2s)]
*  this out on U.S. assets in the region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the biggest concern here is that in the past, when Israel has taken strikes on [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=157.12s)]
*  Iran, they have targeted Israel back. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=162.0s)]
*  But the big concern is that this escalates into a larger regional war that includes Iran [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=164.72s)]
*  taking strikes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=171.0s)]
*  I was very, I am very struck by how quickly the Israelis are putting out detail about [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=172.0s)]
*  that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=176.88s)]
*  You just heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but what I am very, very struck [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=177.88s)]
*  by, Jen, as this is unfolding, is how he and other Israeli officials are speaking very [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=182.04s)]
*  openly about how this is an ongoing campaign that will last some time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=186.27999999999997s)]
*  Meaning there will be more strikes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=190.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=192.28s)]
*  And why that's critical is when we have talked about potential limited strikes on Iranian [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=193.28s)]
*  assets, it's often to delay their enrichment or their development or to disable systems, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=197.68s)]
*  disable their air defenses, something like that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=203.6s)]
*  When we've heard about a real Israeli effort that would destroy the Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  or their program in general, that's something that has always been talked about in days [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=214.0s)]
*  or weeks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  That may be what he's describing here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=220.08s)]
*  Now, we have also heard about that being days or weeks with U.S. military involvement. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=222.44s)]
*  That would be, but they have shown in October, they showed that they can go into Iran, they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=227.56s)]
*  can conduct airstrikes, they can completely cripple their strategic air defense systems, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=233.0s)]
*  and they can do it on their own. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=239.32s)]
*  I mean, some of the reporting has suggested, your reporting too, that their goal, of course, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=240.32s)]
*  is to get the nuclear facilities and to knock out the nuclear facilities. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=243.96s)]
*  I don't think, at least when we came on air, we knew what they had hit yet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=247.96s)]
*  Do we know yet what they hit? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  We know a little bit. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=252.36s)]
*  They hit the facility at Natanz. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=253.36s)]
*  Yes, it seems as if they are trying to take a big, deep hit on the Iranian facility. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=255.32s)]
*  That also seems like it's more than that, including going after scientists, going after [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=263.52s)]
*  their overall program, strikes in and around Tehran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis are, they just put out a statement from Netanyahu, and then we just got a little [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=271.6s)]
*  bit more, just as you came to me from the IDF about, with some fidelity on this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=276.28s)]
*  But again, I think what's really critical here, and I'm shocked actually at the level [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  of detail they are giving while they are acknowledging this is an ongoing days or weeks-long campaign. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  You're shocked because they're saying, basically, there's going to be more strikes moving forward. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=289.96s)]
*  This isn't the end. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and I think one of the reasons for that is, again, Israel in October, they really [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  hit, they destroyed most of the radars for their S-300s. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=299.88s)]
*  They really crippled that system. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=303.44s)]
*  Right now, until their systems are coordinated again back online, it's a lot safer for an [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  Israeli pilot to be flying over Iran. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  It's not safe, but it's safer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  And I just wonder if there is some confidence in their ability to do this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=315.52s)]
*  We're also asking questions about some other capabilities that may have been used here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  It may have been more than airstrikes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kY0qCS_Hw&t=324.44s)]
