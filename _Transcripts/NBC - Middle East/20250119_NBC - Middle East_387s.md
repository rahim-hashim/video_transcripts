# ‘Guns in Gaza have gone silent’: Biden hails success of Israel-Hamas ceasefire
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI)
*  Hold that thought, Danielle. I'm going to President Biden, who's now at the church in South Carolina. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's talking about the peace deal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=5.12s)]
*  C-Series found an effect in Gaza. And today, we're seeing hostages being released. Three [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=6.12s)]
*  Israeli women held against their will in the dark tunnels for 470 days. Four more women [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  will be released in seven days. Three additional hostages every seven days thereafter, including [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=17.76s)]
*  the least two American citizens in this first phase. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=22.52s)]
*  We pray for them and their families, for they're going to be a long recovery ahead. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=27.08s)]
*  By the 16th day of the deal, talks will begin in the second phase. This phase includes the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=32.04s)]
*  release of Israeli soldiers and a permanent end of the war without Hamas and power or [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=37.32s)]
*  able to threaten Israel. Hundreds of trucks are entering Gaza as I speak. They're carrying [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=43.86s)]
*  assistance for civilians who've suffered enormously from the war. That Hamas started [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=49.84s)]
*  on October 7, 2023, nearly 15 months ago. Today alone, we anticipate several hundred [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=55.0s)]
*  trucks will enter the Gaza Strip, probably as I'm speaking. And after so much pain, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  destruction, loss of life, today the guns in Gaza have gone silent. This was the deal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=66.76s)]
*  that I outlined for the world back in May 31st. Many of you covered it at the time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=72.48s)]
*  I was endorsed overwhelmingly by folks around the world, including the U.N. Security Council, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=77.76s)]
*  who unanimously endorsed the deal and developed a coordination with Egypt, Qatar and Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=85.36s)]
*  I've worked in foreign policy for decades, and this is one of the toughest negotiations [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=92.36s)]
*  I've been part of. Many of you who follow these negotiations will attest that the road [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=97.0s)]
*  to this deal has been not easy at all and a long road. But we've reached this point [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=101.92s)]
*  today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas backed by the United States. Some [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=107.12s)]
*  said my policy of a firm support for Israel was relentlessly pursuing diplomacy, risked [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=112.88s)]
*  drawing America into a wider war in the region. I listened to those voices, many of whom I [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=118.16s)]
*  respected a great deal, but I concluded abandoning the course I was on would not have led us to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=122.96s)]
*  the ceasefire we're seeing today. But instead, it would have risked a wider war in the region [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=129.28s)]
*  that so many feared. Now the region has been fundamentally transformed. Hamas' longtime [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=135.44s)]
*  leaders sinned more as dead. Hamas' sponsors in the Middle East have been badly weakened [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=141.6s)]
*  by Israel, backed by the United States. Hezbollah, one of Hamas' biggest backers, was significantly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=146.88s)]
*  weakened on the battlefield, and its leadership was destroyed. Even as we worked for diplomatic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=153.68s)]
*  solutions in Lebanon, we provided ongoing assistance and support to Israel's military [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  campaign against Hezbollah, including its efforts to take out the terror infrastructure [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=163.68s)]
*  along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Israel's campaign was extremely successful, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=169.52s)]
*  so much so that by the end of November, the United States had brokered a ceasefire in Lebanon. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=176.24s)]
*  Hezbollah did what it said it would never do. It cut its deal and abandoned Hamas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  And today, Lebanon, in Lebanon, there's finally a new president and prime minister, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=188.88s)]
*  both of whom support a sovereign Lebanon without Hezbollah running the show or playing any part in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=193.84s)]
*  it. The Assad regime next door in Syria is gone, removing Iran's ready access to Lebanon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran is in the weakest position in decades after the U.S. military helped defend Israel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=208.48s)]
*  from Iranian missiles and supported Israel's military response inside Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=214.32s)]
*  Just look across the region. In Lebanon, there's an opportunity for a future free [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  from the grip of Hezbollah. In Syria, a future free from the Assad, the tyranny of Assad. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=224.0s)]
*  For the Palestinian people, a credible path to a state of their own. And for the region [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=230.72000000000003s)]
*  and the future normalization and integration of Israel with all its Arab neighbors, including [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=236.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, which I've spoken with. You know, we've had many difficult days since Hamas began [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  this terrible war. We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks, but we haven't given up. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=245.92s)]
*  And a special thanks to my team, particularly Brett McGurk, who many of you know, who spent [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  weeks and months working nonstop to reach this deal, many of those weeks and months out of the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=256.64s)]
*  country. Today, ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages is a result of a principled and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=262.4s)]
*  effective policy that we've presided over for months. And we got here without a wider war in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  the Middle East than many predicted. And now it falls on the next administration to help them [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=275.28s)]
*  implement this deal. I was pleased to have our team speak as one voice in the final days. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=280.0s)]
*  It was both necessary and effective and unprecedented. But success is going to require [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=286.32s)]
*  persistence and continuing support for our friends in the region and the belief in diplomacy backed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=290.88s)]
*  by deterrence. So as we reflect on the news from Gaza today, we also remember all the victims of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=297.2s)]
*  this war. They were mindful, mindful that the pursuit of a lasting peace while never easy or [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=304.0s)]
*  quick must always be our calling. So thank you all for listening. May God bless you all. May God [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=310.88s)]
*  protect our troops. I'm looking forward to this deal being fully implemented. And I'm sorry I'm [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=316.48s)]
*  not going to take any questions now because I'm waiting. There's a whole congregation waiting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=321.36s)]
*  for me and I'm sure the remainder of the day I'll have an opportunity to speak with you. Thank you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=324.72s)]
*  very much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=328.8s)]
*  Anything about the condition of the hostages that were released today and the others? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=329.6s)]
*  Yes, I've just got a call saying the three are released into Gaza to the—out of the hands of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=333.04s)]
*  their captors. And they appear to be in good health, but it's early to tell. They're literally [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=344.0s)]
*  being—they may be across the border out of the Gaza Strip into Israel now. I'm not certain. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  Sir, any concerns about the host group? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=355.36s)]
*  President Biden in Charleston, South Carolina. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=358.24s)]
*  We remain in the box. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Says he's not taking questions, but hold on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=361.44s)]
*  As it moves forward? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  No way out. Proud to do. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfD_MNPqEI&t=364.32s)]
