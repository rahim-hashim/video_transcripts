# Trump says he wants to 'clean out' Gaza and move Palestinians to Jordan, Egypt
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs)
*  Let's just look at the front pages of the papers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=0.0s)]
*  The New York Times talking about the two big stories, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=2.92s)]
*  both about Israel, one the attacks yesterday [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=8.28s)]
*  and the very fragile peace treaty, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=10.92s)]
*  if you can call it that, actually ceasefire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  And also the vague but chilling statement [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=18.2s)]
*  that Gaza should be quote, cleaned out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=24.72s)]
*  Also down below, a great story on how Kobe's image [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=28.08s)]
*  all over LA with art on the wall. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=32.28s)]
*  But here, the Wall Street, yeah, okay, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=36.32s)]
*  dueling Wall Street Journal, hold that up. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=40.48s)]
*  So Richard, look at the headlines here, obviously. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=42.8s)]
*  Proposals to vacate Gaza stuns all sides, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=47.28s)]
*  scrambles diplomacy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I would be shocked if we go there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=54.0s)]
*  I think it's just one of those things, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=57.4s)]
*  it grabs headlines, but I find it very hard to believe [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=59.28s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=62.0s)]
*  all of our Sunni Arab allies in the Middle East [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=68.0s)]
*  would go along with a cleaning out of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=72.3s)]
*  where the Palestinian homeland one day should be. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=77.8s)]
*  Well, Joe, nobody in the Arab world, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=82.88s)]
*  beginning with the Palestinians, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=84.76s)]
*  but also the two countries that established peace [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=86.56s)]
*  with Israel first, Egypt and Jordan, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  both of them opposed this vehemently. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=92.34s)]
*  Jordan's already 60 to 70% Palestinian. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=94.08s)]
*  They would worry that any transfer of Palestinian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=97.42s)]
*  populations would destabilize the monarchy in the country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Egypt lives on a knife edge because of its enormous [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=103.86s)]
*  population and its poverty. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=107.16s)]
*  This just wouldn't be acceptable, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=109.88s)]
*  no Palestinian would want it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=111.04s)]
*  The people who are celebrating here are the far right [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=112.92s)]
*  in Israel, these ministers who have been part [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=115.84s)]
*  of Bibi Netanyahu's government for most of the last few [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=118.16s)]
*  years and the settler movement, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=120.64s)]
*  because this is what they want. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=122.4s)]
*  They want to see what's known as transfer, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=123.4s)]
*  the pushing out of Palestinians and therefore making Gaza [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  and even more important to them, the West Bank, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=129.24s)]
*  what they call Judea and Samaria, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=131.16s)]
*  open to Israeli settlement to ultimately annexation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=133.32s)]
*  So I think this is a non-starter, Joe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=137.56s)]
*  What's interesting to me is where did this come from? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=139.68s)]
*  What does it tell us about the policy process [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=142.76s)]
*  of the new president, that an idea that is so, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=145.14s)]
*  I think so much a non-starter and so potentially [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  inconsistent with stability and peace in the region, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=152.05999999999997s)]
*  where did this come from? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  Why was it being surfaced the way it was? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=155.77999999999997s)]
*  And that's what I'd like to hear a little bit more about. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  It's interesting because- [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=162.5s)]
*  All right, let's go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  Joe, it's interesting because I was talking to somebody [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=165.14s)]
*  who ultimately ended up becoming a member of the cabinet [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=168.1s)]
*  and he says a lot of the concepts are opening bids. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=170.94s)]
*  I don't really know where this stands in that, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=175.14s)]
*  but let's go live to Tel Aviv. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=177.1s)]
*  We'll switch up our rundown this morning. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=178.7s)]
*  NBC News international correspondent, Raf Sanchez. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=180.7s)]
*  Raf, what more do we know about this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=183.26s)]
*  Well, Mika, this has been a dramatic and emotional weekend [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  here in the Middle East, starting with those comments [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=191.54s)]
*  by President Trump made to reporters on Air Force One, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=193.5s)]
*  suggesting that 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  that is three quarters of the population, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=201.38s)]
*  be moved so that the strip can be, in his words, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=203.78s)]
*  cleaned out, as he said, suggesting that they go to Egypt [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  and Jordan, immediate and very firm rejections [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=209.74s)]
*  by those two Arab allies of the United States, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=213.66s)]
*  saying as far as they are concerned, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=216.38s)]
*  that is a total non-starter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=218.02s)]
*  Now over the weekend here, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=220.34s)]
*  those four young Israeli soldiers released [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=221.74s)]
*  from Hamas captivity after 477 days, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=224.86s)]
*  very emotional scenes as they were freed from Gaza, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  they were reunited with their families. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=232.94s)]
*  We actually sat with the family [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=235.1s)]
*  of one of those soldiers, Liri Al Bag, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=237.18s)]
*  she's second from the left in that photo, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=239.1s)]
*  and we watched with them in real time [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=241.26s)]
*  this sort of surreal Hamas spectacle. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=243.9s)]
*  Those four soldiers marched on stage in costume uniforms [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=246.18s)]
*  in front of the cameras, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=251.02s)]
*  and then released into the hands of the Red Cross [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=252.74s)]
*  and handed back over to Israeli forces. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  Now that all played out very much in public. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=257.82s)]
*  What was going on in private over the weekend [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=260.34s)]
*  were absolute crisis talks, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=262.9s)]
*  because this ceasefire was under real stray, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=264.58s)]
*  and Hamas had not released an Israeli civilian [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=267.5s)]
*  called Arbel Yehud, who Israel says, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=270.85999999999996s)]
*  under the terms of the agreement, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=273.41999999999996s)]
*  should have been released ahead of those four soldiers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=274.78s)]
*  In response, Israel refusing to allow [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=278.29999999999995s)]
*  Palestinian civilians to return to their homes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=280.7s)]
*  in northern Gaza, but a deal was brokered, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=284.05999999999995s)]
*  and this week we are expecting not just the three hostages [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=287.94s)]
*  who were scheduled to come out, but six hostages in total. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  So Arbel Yehud will come out on Thursday, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=296.86s)]
*  along with two others, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=300.06s)]
*  and then those three additional hostages [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=301.38s)]
*  will come out on Saturday, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=303.74s)]
*  and Mika, that is raising hopes [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=305.18s)]
*  that we may finally see American hostage, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=307.38s)]
*  Keith Siegel, a 65-year-old grandfather, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=310.7s)]
*  released from Hamas captivity sometime this week. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  You might remember he was taken along with his wife. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=318.38s)]
*  His wife was released in the first stage of the deal, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=321.42s)]
*  and he has been in Gaza for 15 months now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=324.18s)]
*  As well as those two hostage releases, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  we are expecting President Trump's envoy [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=330.86s)]
*  to the Middle East, Steve Wittkopf, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=333.1s)]
*  to make his first trip here [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  since the Trump administration took office. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=337.14000000000004s)]
*  This is a man who was deeply involved [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=339.1s)]
*  in brokering that deal in Qatar, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=341.3s)]
*  and Wittkopf is saying that he is not only [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=343.98s)]
*  gonna visit Israel, do the meetings with Prime Minister [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=346.42s)]
*  Netanyahu that you would expect, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=348.62s)]
*  but that he is also thinking about going into Gaza himself, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=350.38s)]
*  a ceasefire obviously on, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=356.18s)]
*  but this is still a dangerous part of the world. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  So that would be a first for a senior US official. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=360.02s)]
*  All right, NBZ's Raf Sanchez, thank you so much. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=364.9s)]
*  We greatly appreciate your reporting, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=368.5s)]
*  and Mika, you brought up before about talking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=370.34s)]
*  to a cabinet member in the Trump administration. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=373.61999999999995s)]
*  We've also seen Jamie Dimon and other people just talk, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=377.5s)]
*  when they talk about, for instance, tariffs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=380.82s)]
*  Most see it as an opening bid, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=385.38s)]
*  and there have been many people around Donald Trump [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=387.78s)]
*  that say it's the opening bid. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=391.38s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump reportedly told the Senate, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=393.38s)]
*  Senate Republicans last weekend [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=397.5s)]
*  that he doesn't wanna quote tax people, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  he doesn't wanna put the tariffs on people, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=402.7s)]
*  but he will if he has to, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  but he also suggested to the Senate Republicans [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=408.26s)]
*  that these are opening bids. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=412.46s)]
*  We see that in the Middle East, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=414.34s)]
*  of course, it's a non-starter in the Middle East, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=416.58s)]
*  if you look at Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=419.06s)]
*  and all the things that they wanna do [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=420.94s)]
*  by extending the Abraham Accords, that cannot be done [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=423.29999999999995s)]
*  if Gaza is quote cleared out, they know that, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  but also fascinating what happened overnight [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=430.18s)]
*  regarding tariffs and Colombia. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=434.22s)]
*  Again, we saw the opening bid, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=436.62s)]
*  and then we saw the negotiations there, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=439.02000000000004s)]
*  and it's fascinating. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=442.26s)]
*  I think we're gonna see this with a lot more countries, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=443.5s)]
*  the use of tariffs as a quote opening bid in negotiations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=447.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kJOdXA_lXs&t=456.86s)]
