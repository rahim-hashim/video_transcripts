# Analyst: Israel 'flipped the script on Hezbollah in a matter of days'
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg)
*  Joining me now, Joel Rubin, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, president of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=0.0s)]
*  the Washington Strategy Group and Democratic strategist at Democracy Partners. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=4.88s)]
*  Welcome, Joel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=9.0s)]
*  Let's get into this, because Hezbollah today confirmed the deaths of two more senior members [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=10.0s)]
*  killed in these airstrikes by the Israeli military. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=14.24s)]
*  How does this affect the ability of this militant group to respond? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, Alex, what we're witnessing is the most stunning Israeli military success since the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=21.72s)]
*  1967 Six-Day War. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=28.64s)]
*  They have flipped the script entirely on Hezbollah in a matter of days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=31.2s)]
*  And Hezbollah is reeling, as we've seen now for the past 10-plus days, from the pager [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=36.6s)]
*  attacks, which decimated their internal communications, to now the devastating assassination of Sam [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=41.56s)]
*  Nasrallah and his top lieutenants. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=47.88s)]
*  Hezbollah right now is lost in the wilderness, and Israel is taking advantage. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  So this means that Israel now is trying to identify, target and destroy Hezbollah's sequential [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=54.48s)]
*  leadership and then as a result of that as well, to try to take out its missile capabilities [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=61.16s)]
*  and its ability to attack northern Israel as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=67.24s)]
*  So it's really a moment that I believe the Israeli government, Bibi Netanyahu, are leaning [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=71.0s)]
*  into. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=75.4s)]
*  This is a moment to press their advantage. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=76.4s)]
*  And President Biden briefly responded to a question yesterday when asked about the chances [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=79.32s)]
*  of a ground invasion by Israel into Lebanon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=82.84s)]
*  Take a listen to what he said. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=85.8s)]
*  It's quick. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=86.8s)]
*  Mr. President, is a ground incursion into Lebanon inevitable? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=87.8s)]
*  Time for a ceasefire. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=90.8s)]
*  The president continuing his calls for a ceasefire. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=96.56s)]
*  But how do these strikes in Lebanon affect the chances of one? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=98.56s)]
*  Well, I do think there is the possibility of a limited ground incursion if it's going [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=102.8s)]
*  to result in eliminating weapons caches and missile capabilities from Hezbollah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=108.2s)]
*  But Israel has a long history, a very dark history of ground invasions and occupation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=114.76s)]
*  of southern Lebanon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=120.48s)]
*  It has not ended well for Israel, and that's not something that will maintain their advantage. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=121.48s)]
*  When we talk about a regional war, Alex, we're talking basically about Israel versus Iran, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=127.16s)]
*  not against Arab countries. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=131.96s)]
*  The Arab countries are staying out of this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=133.36s)]
*  By invading and occupying Lebanon, that would change the dynamics and it would bring in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=135.74s)]
*  pressure from countries that Israel has built a good relationship with in the Gulf. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=139.78s)]
*  So it would be a very dangerous maneuver for them to do that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=143.9s)]
*  And I think they'd have to be very clear in messaging if they go on the ground as to what [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=147.54s)]
*  their purpose is and how it is very time limited. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=151.62s)]
*  But earlier today, Joel, Iran's foreign minister said the recent killings of senior leaders [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=154.98s)]
*  will not go unanswered. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=159.38s)]
*  So what sort of response do you expect from Iran? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=160.7s)]
*  Well, I think this, as Matt said, this is the real wild card. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=164.26s)]
*  Right now, we, the United States, we have our aircraft carriers out in the region trying [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=167.98s)]
*  to deter Iran from taking shots that could be unwise. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=172.38s)]
*  I think they need to think more than three times about what they're witnessing right [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=176.54s)]
*  now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=180.94s)]
*  Israel is, its effectiveness, its strikes have been extraordinary. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=181.94s)]
*  It is untethered in many ways. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=186.74s)]
*  It is attacking the Houthis right now in Yemen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=188.58s)]
*  And for Iran, this is a moment to think about maybe calling off Hamas, maybe joining in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=191.42s)]
*  the calls as President Biden and Vice President Harris are calling for, calling for this ceasefire. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=196.7s)]
*  That would put the political dynamics and the diplomatic opportunity in front of us [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=201.62s)]
*  that these strikes have created for Israel as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=206.54s)]
*  So Iran does not have a lot of strong military cards to play right now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=210.62s)]
*  And there are diplomatic options out for them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=217.18s)]
*  And yet, of course, as you're pointing out, that is the big wild card. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=220.82s)]
*  It's just that their proxies are getting devastated right now by Israel. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=223.46s)]
*  And they themselves have been very loath to directly engage and intervene as a result. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=227.58s)]
*  OK, I appreciate your insights, Joel Rubin. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=233.5s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209INgCFJUg&t=235.9s)]
