# Prince Turki Al Faisal Al-Saud: The American Withdrawal From Afghanistan ‘Was Inevitable’
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY)
*  Joining us now is Prince Turki al-Faisal al-Saoud, the former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=0.0s)]
*  from 1977 to 2001 and a former Saudi ambassador to the U.S., among other titles. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much, Prince Turki, for being here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=12.0s)]
*  The author, of course, your new book is The Afghanistan File. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=14.92s)]
*  And this is such an unusual memoir from a Saudi prince, I must say. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=18.84s)]
*  Well, thank you, Ms. Mitchell, for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=22.56s)]
*  Well, please, Ed, please call me Andrea. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=24.68s)]
*  But this—we've known each other for a long time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=26.48s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=29.68s)]
*  You were ambassador here, you taught here, you went to school here many years ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=30.68s)]
*  And this recounts a history of Afghanistan that many Americans may not be familiar with. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=36.28s)]
*  Among your acknowledgments are Zvig Berzinski and Brent Scowcroft, former national security [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=41.68s)]
*  advisors, because the billions of dollars that America spent in Afghanistan began in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=46.84s)]
*  1979, 1980. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=52.68s)]
*  You were intelligence chief, and the Saudis spent billions and billions more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Over decades, to get the Soviets out, and then the Taliban came in and tried to get [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=59.28s)]
*  bin Laden out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  So you have given a full accounting for the first time of all the money invested in this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=65.36s)]
*  tragic country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=70.16s)]
*  Well, not just the money. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=71.16s)]
*  I hope I also showed the tragedy, as you describe it, of a country that was totally peaceful [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=72.92s)]
*  and in one overnight situation invaded by this huge army that overturned everything. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=80.48s)]
*  The Saudis, the Soviets. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=89.72s)]
*  The Soviets. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=90.72s)]
*  The army. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=91.72s)]
*  And of course, it sent shockwaves around the world. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=92.72s)]
*  In those days, your present viewers may not remember this, but the Soviet Union seemed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  to be on the march in the 1970s after the Watergate scandals here in America, the curtailing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=103.52s)]
*  of the activities of the CIA by Congress, et cetera. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  So the kingdom and Pakistan initially started this cooperation when President of the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=118.4s)]
*  United States, the United States, was elected president of the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=148.4s)]
*  And that's when it all started. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=155.4s)]
*  Now, after everything that's happened, and I have to tell people to read the book, the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=158.4s)]
*  Afghanistan file, now the Americans and NATO withdraw. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=162.4s)]
*  And look at what's happening. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=167.4s)]
*  Richard Engel is there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=168.4s)]
*  The U.S. has not unfrozen the assets of the country because the Taliban, we do not consider [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=170.4s)]
*  this place a government. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=174.4s)]
*  So what to do about this humanitarian tragedy? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=175.4s)]
*  And what do you think about the American withdrawal? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=178.4s)]
*  Well, I think the American withdrawal was inevitable. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=180.4s)]
*  And once Mr. Trump made the deal with the Taliban behind the back of the legitimate [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=184.4s)]
*  government there, it was quite obvious that, if you like, America had chosen the Taliban [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=191.4s)]
*  as its successor regime. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=197.4s)]
*  And I think that led to the way that the Afghan army broke down and Afghan governors made [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=199.4s)]
*  deals with the Taliban and the president of Afghanistan left in such a way, et cetera, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=209.4s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=215.4s)]
*  And so it was not unexpected that what happened would happen. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=216.4s)]
*  But I must say, I was very disappointed and shocked at how it happened. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=224.4s)]
*  And the scramble to the airport in Kabul by these thousands of people without preparedness [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=229.4s)]
*  or order and so on was unacceptable. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=238.4s)]
*  And leaving behind, of course, not only nationals but people who worked with America is equally [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=242.4s)]
*  a thing that your government is having to deal with on a constant basis. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=248.4s)]
*  And for us in Saudi Arabia, we saw the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, which was much more orderly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=254.4s)]
*  in those days. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=261.4s)]
*  But although, I must say, the Soviets were equally afraid that their withdrawal would [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=262.4s)]
*  be done in a less orderly manner than it happened. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=269.4s)]
*  I have to ask you about subsequent events as well in your country, because you mentioned [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=273.4s)]
*  you acknowledge Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=280.4s)]
*  He worked with you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=282.4s)]
*  And you don't mention his murder and the fact that the CIA has concluded that the crown [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=284.4s)]
*  prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has responsibility for that brutal murder, that nothing happens [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=293.4s)]
*  in the kingdom of this nature without him knowing, and Kittani and others. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=299.4s)]
*  Don't you think there needs— [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=303.4s)]
*  I would disagree with the CIA's conclusions, because they're based on conjecture. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=305.4s)]
*  They're based on analysis. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=310.4s)]
*  They're based on presumption. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=312.4s)]
*  And so, from my view, they didn't produce any evidence of the crown prince's involvement. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=314.4s)]
*  Well, the evidence was destroyed, but isn't there— [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=320.4s)]
*  Well, destroyed, that is something that— [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=323.4s)]
*  But as an experienced intelligence leader, you know that intelligence analysis is based [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=324.4s)]
*  on the fact that he is the leader, his right-hand man, Kittani, who was named as the person [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=329.4s)]
*  responsible in charge of that unit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=335.4s)]
*  How could he not have been responsible? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=337.4s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you one thing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=339.4s)]
*  Prince Mohammed took responsibility for that in a television interview with a rival American [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=341.4s)]
*  network. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=346.4s)]
*  He did say that it happened under my watch, and I take responsibility for it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=347.4s)]
*  But punishment— [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=351.4s)]
*  But he didn't absolve himself of responsibility. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=352.4s)]
*  But punishment for Kittani, his right-hand man? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=354.4s)]
*  Well, that is for the courts to decide, not for me. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=356.4s)]
*  And we have a judicial system in the kingdom that tried the killers of Khashoggi and put [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=360.4s)]
*  them in jail. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=366.4s)]
*  And the family of Khashoggi accepted that verdict and considered it a just verdict. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=367.4s)]
*  And the people of Saudi Arabia mourned Jamal Khashoggi more than anybody else. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=373.4s)]
*  And they gave him funerals in the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=377.4s)]
*  It was a heinous crime and unacceptable in all terms. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=382.4s)]
*  But I didn't mention him in the book and didn't mention the murder in the book because [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=386.4s)]
*  the book was about Afghanistan, not about Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=390.4s)]
*  I wasn't trying to avoid that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=393.4s)]
*  Let me ask you about Yemen now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=395.4s)]
*  It's been almost seven years, this terrible war, billions of dollars. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=397.4s)]
*  Is there time—is it time for Saudi Arabia to find a way out of this? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=401.4s)]
*  But now the Houthis back by Iran are in control of the most important parts of the country. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=408.4s)]
*  Well, we hope we don't withdraw the way that America withdrew from Afghanistan. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=414.4s)]
*  I think we made our commitment to the legitimate government of Yemen, which is recognized by [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=419.4s)]
*  the world community and which Security Council Resolution 216 of the United Nations supports [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=424.4s)]
*  the legitimate government and called on the world community to put an embargo on arms [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=432.4s)]
*  to the Houthis. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=438.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, Iran continues to break that embargo. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=439.4s)]
*  So it is not Saudi Arabia that has to account for its conduct, but rather Iran and the Houthis. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=442.4s)]
*  The Houthis instigated a coup d'état and took over illegally from a legitimate government. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=447.4s)]
*  And the legitimate government called for help, and Saudi Arabia and other countries provided help. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=454.4s)]
*  So this is how Saudi Arabia conducts itself in Yemen, as a supporter of legitimacy, rather [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=459.4s)]
*  than an uprising driven by a small militia that took over in Yemen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=465.4s)]
*  And on Iran, the international inspectors from the U.N. have now just concluded as well [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=472.4s)]
*  that they are breaking out and running centrifuges in an area that cannot be monitored by the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=479.4s)]
*  U.N. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=485.4s)]
*  How concerned are you about Iran getting a very short window in order to develop a nuclear [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=486.4s)]
*  weapon if they choose? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=494.4s)]
*  It is very concerning and very, very troublesome. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=495.4s)]
*  Of course, our concern as well is not only with Iran's development of nuclear weapon, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=498.4s)]
*  but of Iran's conduct in the area. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=503.4s)]
*  Two years ago, Iran attacked Saudi oil installations in the eastern province. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=505.4s)]
*  And that, of course, is unacceptable. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=511.4s)]
*  They keep supplying the Houthis with missiles and drones that the Houthis then launch at [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=513.4s)]
*  Saudi targets, civilian targets, I might add. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=518.4s)]
*  Do you think the new Iranian leader, Raisi, is as well responsible for the assassination [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=520.4s)]
*  attempt against the Iraqi prime minister, or do you think that that was a rogue group? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=525.4s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=529.4s)]
*  I am not in the official loop to get information on that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=531.4s)]
*  But also on Iran, you know, the original deal, if you remember, under Mr. Obama, was accepted [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=534.4s)]
*  by Saudi Arabia with assurances from Mr. Obama that it would prevent Iran from having [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=542.4s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=547.4s)]
*  And the king visited Mr. Obama after the signing of the deal, and they issued a joint [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=548.4s)]
*  statement in which Mr. Obama and the king agreed to undertake actions to prevent Iranian [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=553.4s)]
*  disturbing activities in the area. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=561.4s)]
*  And that's why the king accepted the president's assurance on the deal. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=563.4s)]
*  However, Iran did not stop interfering in the area, as we see with the Houthis and in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=569.4s)]
*  Syria and in Lebanon and in Iraq and, as you mentioned, the attempts on the prime minister's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=574.4s)]
*  life in Iraq. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=580.4s)]
*  So Iran has to be held to account on these things. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=582.4s)]
*  And they haven't been held to account so far. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=586.4s)]
*  So what should be done? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=588.4s)]
*  Well, I think there should be more sanctions on Iran. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=589.4s)]
*  That's my personal view, rather than engaging with them and promulgating some lifting of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=592.4s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=597.4s)]
*  But Iran hasn't shown any positive step towards not only curtailing their nuclear deal, curtailing [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=598.4s)]
*  nuclear enrichment, but also their disturbing activities in the area. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=604.4s)]
*  And, I might add, they use blackmail to get what they want. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=608.4s)]
*  Developing a nuclear bomb is a method to blackmail the rest of us into accepting what Iran wants [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=614.4s)]
*  to do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=621.4s)]
*  We don't have much time, but would the Saudis develop a bomb if they think Iran is moving [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=622.4s)]
*  in that direction? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=625.4s)]
*  Well, I publicly said in the past that we should do whatever is necessary, including [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=626.4s)]
*  acquiring the knowledge to develop a bomb in order to defend ourselves against a potential [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=632.4s)]
*  nuclear-armed Iran. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=640.4s)]
*  I am not in government to say what the government is going to do, but this is my personal opinion. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=642.4s)]
*  Prince Chokhi, thank you so much. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=648.4s)]
*  Afghanistan File is the book, and it is really an extraordinary history. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=650.4s)]
*  Thank you, Andrei. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=654.4s)]
*  We thank you for coming in. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=655.4s)]
*  You've been very gracious. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=656.4s)]
*  We thank you very much. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvHB_RN-KY&t=657.4s)]
