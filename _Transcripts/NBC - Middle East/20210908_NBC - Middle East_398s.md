# China Sees An Opportunity In Taliban Takeover Of Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY)
*  With the U.S. mission in Afghanistan over after nearly 20 years, the Biden White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=0.0s)]
*  says it will shift its focus to other threats and adversaries around the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  One of those adversaries is China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=12.88s)]
*  But despite the powerful Chinese government having little in common with a Taliban rule [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=15.88s)]
*  in its infancy, the two sides are finding some common ground. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=21.16s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News foreign correspondent Janice Mackey-Frayer, live in Beijing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=26.6s)]
*  Janice, what more can you tell us about this? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=32.6s)]
*  Well, publicly we've seen China gloating about the U.S. withdrawal and how messy it was. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=35.6s)]
*  But privately, officials here are more circumspect. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=42.6s)]
*  Certainly, they were never happy about having a large U.S. military presence on the other [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=45.6s)]
*  side of its border locked in a war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  China did arguably enjoy the benefit of having the U.S. and NATO forces shouldering the security [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=52.68s)]
*  burden in the region for the last 20 years. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=59.68s)]
*  So now China has opportunities to flex its soft power muscles, to make massive investments [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=61.68s)]
*  in infrastructure, but it is also facing serious risks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=68.68s)]
*  China is fearful of attacks inside the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=72.68s)]
*  It's that threat that they've used as justification time and again for its policies with Uighurs [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=75.68s)]
*  and other minorities in Xinjiang. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=81.72000000000001s)]
*  But security is what's driving China's relationship with the Taliban and what they're now calling [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  friendly relations. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=89.72000000000001s)]
*  There was a Taliban delegation that came here in July. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=90.72000000000001s)]
*  They gave security assurances. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=93.72000000000001s)]
*  They're now declaring China as their most important partner. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=95.72000000000001s)]
*  These are all moves that the U.S. is going to be watching very closely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=98.72s)]
*  Now, I sat down with Zhou Bo. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=102.72s)]
*  He's a retired senior colonel in China's PLA, the People's Liberation Army. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=104.72s)]
*  And it's rare that we get to hear from a military insider. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=110.76s)]
*  He recently wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times that talked about China's golden [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=114.76s)]
*  opportunity, which is mainly to capitalize on what's widely seen as the failure of U.S. policy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=118.76s)]
*  How does China feel about the outcome in Afghanistan? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Is it happy that the U.S. has pulled out in a messy way? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=131.76s)]
*  What are China's advantages? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=135.76s)]
*  First is political impartiality. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  The second is huge economic opportunities for Afghans. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  When I talk about the first point, let me remind you that Afghans do not have bad memories [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  of China being invaders because China has never invaded Afghanistan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  So when China talk about the things it would want to do or if China talk about this issue [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  in your security council, China's points are worthwhile. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=162.84s)]
*  Afghanistan is a war-torn country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=167.84s)]
*  There are bad roads, there are poor houses, there is no industry. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=169.84s)]
*  And China, besides, is one of its direct neighbors. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=174.84s)]
*  So with American troops withdrawing, the major concern for Chinese companies about security is gone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=178.84s)]
*  So these are huge opportunities. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=186.84s)]
*  Are the optics not strange that China is fighting extremism at home yet embracing an extremist group next door? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=189.88s)]
*  No. It depends on how you define Taliban government. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=198.88s)]
*  The fact is the Afghan Taliban has taken over the whole country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=204.88s)]
*  and they have promised to make changes in the right directions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=209.88s)]
*  So why don't we give them a chance? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=214.88s)]
*  Why would we insist there are terrorist groups? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=216.92s)]
*  And who actually did the biggest damage in Afghanistan? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=220.92s)]
*  It's American-led war. It's NATO forces. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=225.92s)]
*  China has yet to recognize the Taliban government as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=230.92s)]
*  But to an extent, it's already doing the Taliban's diplomatic legwork, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=236.92s)]
*  speaking on behalf of the group, asking the world to give it a chance. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=241.92s)]
*  The Taliban is counting on Chinese investment and Chinese funding, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  given the fact that most of its foreign aid is going to dry up. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  So what we could see going forward is actually the beginning of a very pragmatic partnership [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  if Kabul does deliver on those security assurances that they've given to Beijing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=258.96s)]
*  You know, Janice, I've heard for some time, and I'm sure you have as well, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=263.96s)]
*  from diplomats and leaders of other countries, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=269.96s)]
*  that when the United States comes in to help a country, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=274.0s)]
*  they talk about human rights and they lecture them on, you know, ask questions. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=277.0s)]
*  How are you going to treat certain religious minorities? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=282.0s)]
*  How are you going to treat women and girls? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=286.0s)]
*  And these diplomats say when the Chinese come in, they just say, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=289.0s)]
*  what do you need? How much do you want? Here's the check. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=292.0s)]
*  Nothing attached to it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=296.0s)]
*  Is that the sort of relationship we expect to be, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=297.0s)]
*  that could possibly be set up here between China and Afghanistan? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=300.04s)]
*  Well, Chinese officials are known for their transactional diplomacy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=306.04s)]
*  And what is likely going to happen in Afghanistan is that there are going to be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=310.04s)]
*  these massive investments in infrastructure. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=315.04s)]
*  China sees the opportunity to finish that missing piece of the puzzle [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=317.04s)]
*  and the Belt and Road Initiative that will connect Central Asia to the Middle East. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=321.04s)]
*  So they do see the opportunity, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  and it's worth for them to take a gamble on the Taliban. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  And you're right, the funding is going to come with very few questions asked [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  about human rights, about democracy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  So in that sense, there are some who believe that the Taliban and China [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  actually make a fairly good partnership. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that China is wading in too far. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  They realize that Kashi needs to be taken, that there are security risks. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=353.12s)]
*  They have Pakistan on side that is going to continue to be a congree to the Taliban. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=359.12s)]
*  But again, publicly, officials are saying that the Taliban's deeds [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=365.12s)]
*  need to match their words and they need to deliver on those security assurances. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAze0cPRsY&t=370.12s)]
