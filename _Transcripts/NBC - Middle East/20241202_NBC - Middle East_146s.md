# ‘No real optimism’: Matt Bradley on the negotiation of remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o)
*  Joining me now from Beirut is NBC's Matt Bradley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=0.0s)]
*  Matt, what else do we know about what happened to Omer? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=3.04s)]
*  Yeah, actually, well, we don't know very much, because normally in these sorts of situations [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=6.48s)]
*  where the IDF would announce the death of somebody who died as a hostage in the Gaza [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=12.36s)]
*  Strip, there would be some sort of intelligence that would have led to it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=18.04s)]
*  But now we don't really know why the IDF decided to release this information about the death [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=20.6s)]
*  of Nutra more than a year ago during those October 7 attacks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=27.0s)]
*  And as you said, he was thought to have been alive and being kept as a hostage all this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=30.6s)]
*  time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  We do know that he was a tank commander. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=35.8s)]
*  He was killed in combat, according to the IDF, near the kibbutz of Neiraz on October [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=37.64s)]
*  7. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=44.0s)]
*  But, you know, there's also news just over this past weekend of another American Israeli [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=45.0s)]
*  hostage who was discovered to be alive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=49.04s)]
*  my colleague Hala Gurani over the weekend. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  And here's what she said. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=84.06s)]
*  So I ask him, please, Benjamin Netanyahu, be strong for the country, be strong for Israel, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  and release them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=93.9s)]
*  And the fact is, Andrea, that despite all of this renewed interest because of the revelations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=98.62s)]
*  around these two American Israelis, the fact is, is that there is no real optimism around [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=103.54s)]
*  the push for a new deal that would free these remaining hostages, even though there has [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=108.9s)]
*  been a peace treaty here in Lebanon, where I am now between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=113.42s)]
*  It doesn't look as though, despite some a bit of talk about this, that one deal might [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=118.62s)]
*  lead to another. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfGu_92di5o&t=124.86000000000001s)]
