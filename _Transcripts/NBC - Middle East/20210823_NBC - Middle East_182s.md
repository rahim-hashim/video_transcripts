# Afghan Evacuees Subject To Multiple Health Screenings, Including For Covid
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E)
*  We learned that there wasn't just one baby born on one of these flights, one of these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=0.0s)]
*  evacuation flights this weekend at Ramstein in Germany. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=4.48s)]
*  But the general who you were briefing with actually said there's been three babies born [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  in these circumstances? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=11.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=12.36s)]
*  He surprised everybody, including me, on that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=13.36s)]
*  This is General Steve Lyons. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=16.4s)]
*  He's the commander of U.S. Transportation Command. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=17.72s)]
*  And we wanted him to come in and talk to our press corps about the incredible logistics [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=20.2s)]
*  effort that is going into moving these thousands of people out of Afghanistan into temporary [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=24.1s)]
*  safe havens elsewhere as they work their way back to the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=29.44s)]
*  And right at the end of the briefing, he got asked about the one baby that we knew had [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=33.44s)]
*  been born, because there were great, great photographs of that, of course. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=37.88s)]
*  And he let it slip that, in fact, actually two others had been born. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=41.36s)]
*  So we and the press corps here at the Pentagon are trying to chase down the details on that, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=45.36s)]
*  because it's just a great story and just another indication of the humanity and the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=49.2s)]
*  professionalism and the kindness with which U.S. military members are really treating [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  their important evacuation work. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=58.84s)]
*  It also tells you about the humanity and the desperation of the people who are getting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=61.7s)]
*  out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=66.84s)]
*  I mean, for somebody to be not just pregnant, but pregnant upon the moment of potentially [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=67.84s)]
*  delivering somebody who's going to go into labor during the flight and still at that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  moment putting themselves in peril, taking their fragile selves and their families and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  getting themselves on board one of those military transports. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=81.74s)]
*  I mean, the extremists that these women and their families are in to be able to do this, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=84.74s)]
*  it does make me wonder about the kinds of medical resources that are being made available [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  to these refugees, the kinds of resources that they need once they land, how long they're [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  staying at the initial place they first land once they're taken out of Afghanistan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=99.58s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=103.66s)]
*  So there's some initial medical screening at Kabul before they get onto a flight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=105.38s)]
*  We want to make sure that they're OK. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=110.3s)]
*  So there's some medical treatment there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  There are, and the general said this, there's no medical personnel on these flights. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=114.9s)]
*  We're saving every available space for passengers, for people that want to get out, who are, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  as you rightly said, Rachel, desperate to leave. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=124.9s)]
*  So we're not putting medical personnel on these flights. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=127.7s)]
*  But then when they get to these temporary safe havens or staging bases, if you will, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=130.06s)]
*  they again are evaluated for any medical issues and given a chance to get some more screening there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=136.22s)]
*  And then, of course, when they get back to the United States, we go through that again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=142.62s)]
*  We definitely screen them for COVID. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=146.18s)]
*  At some of these staging bases, all of them are getting screened for COVID when they get to the United States. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=149.38s)]
*  Right now, they're coming in to Dulles. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=153.62s)]
*  And then so there's constantly throughout the process medical personnel that are trying to look after them as best we can. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6xwoIL_9E&t=155.57999999999998s)]
