# Israeli air defense systems could protect against missiles, but amount launched will matter
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8)
*  As we all know, Israel is an incredibly small country, and as you just mentioned, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=0.0s)]
*  and so it would be hard to avoid civilian casualties if in fact you are targeting these areas, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=4.0s)]
*  unlike, for instance, if Israel were to retaliate and target Natanz, which is a nuclear facility inside Iran, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=9.0s)]
*  which is more of a rural area inside Iran and able to avoid more civilian casualties. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=16.0s)]
*  Talk more about that, the lay of the land in Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=22.0s)]
*  Well, you know, military targets, as you say, it's a tiny country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=26.0s)]
*  So military targets, military installations are spread throughout the country near civilian centers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=32.0s)]
*  Actually, there are very few, I would say there are very few military targets that are separated in any significant way from civilian areas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=42.0s)]
*  So again, Israel has a very sophisticated defense system, maybe one of the most sophisticated air defense systems in the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=52.0s)]
*  We've been seeing a lot of the Iron Dome, haven't we, recently, which is that anti-rocket defense system, shooting down rockets in the sky, short range rockets. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=64.0s)]
*  But the Iron Dome system is useless against ballistic missiles, for instance, or much longer range cruise missiles. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=75.0s)]
*  On the other hand, Israel has two other defense systems, which one is called David's Sling and the other one is called the Arrow system. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=84.0s)]
*  And one of those systems is against medium range rockets and the Arrow system is against ballistic missiles. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=91.0s)]
*  So Israel is well prepared to shoot down these missiles that are on the way. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=99.0s)]
*  The question is how many missiles are on the way and how many missiles, how many anti-missile rockets can Israel fire at any one time? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=103.0s)]
*  Will Israel be overwhelmed by a large number of rockets on the way right now or will Israel be able to shoot them down? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=113.0s)]
*  So this is the question. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=120.0s)]
*  And again, another significant question is with all those rockets in the air above Israel, Israel's defense system firing, shooting down rockets. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=121.0s)]
*  That's a lot of debris falling onto the ground all over Israel could easily fall onto the towns, onto villages affecting civilians. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=132.0s)]
*  So however, however significant Israel's defense system is against these incoming rockets, there's a lot of debris and a lot of potential damage to civilians, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=140.0s)]
*  regardless of whether they're near those military installations or not. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=151.0s)]
*  So again, I emphasize that this is a moment of extreme vulnerability for Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=155.0s)]
*  And the question is how many missiles on the way? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=162.0s)]
*  What is their payload and can Israel shoot them down? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=164.0s)]
*  I know there are bunkers in Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=168.0s)]
*  Has there been any expression from the government asking citizens, Israeli citizens to seek shelter, to find bunkers for safety? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=171.0s)]
*  Actually, that's a great question because so far there's been the Israeli home defense, home defense system has told people to be aware. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=181.0s)]
*  They've, for instance, they've so they've closed all schools tomorrow. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=190.0s)]
*  They've told people not to gather, not to gather in more than a thousand people in one place at one time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=194.0s)]
*  And that's about it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=201.0s)]
*  I mean, there haven't been any alarms of the mother and any alarms that we've seen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=202.0s)]
*  I guess the rockets aren't close enough yet. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=208.0s)]
*  They will come. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=211.0s)]
*  But there hasn't been there's been no significant move by the government to tell the people go in your shelters. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=212.0s)]
*  We people have not yet been told to go into their shelters. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=220.0s)]
*  I'm sure they will be very soon, but it hasn't happened yet. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=224.0s)]
*  But the again, as I mentioned earlier, every Israeli home is supposed to have some kind of defensive room, a sitting area, a place to sit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=227.0s)]
*  They're supposed to have some kind of defensive room, a set, what they call a safe room. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=235.0s)]
*  And by the way, it's not every home. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=240.0s)]
*  I must correct myself. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=241.0s)]
*  There are many villages, especially Arab villages, Arab villages from Israeli Arab. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=242.0s)]
*  They don't have any security rooms in their homes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=247.0s)]
*  So they're local Arabs are actually more vulnerable than Jews. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=252.0s)]
*  I can put it so crassly because in the Israeli towns, each town, each house that was built in the last 30 years has to have some kind of a safe room, a concrete room which can protect the citizens against against rockets or bombs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=258.0s)]
*  And that only applies to the towns and to many of the villages and many of the Arab villages. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VeaJPX9Ux8&t=277.0s)]
