# ‘The clouds are over all of us. The tensions are thick’: Kirby on ceasefire talks
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk)
*  the clouds are over all of us, and we understand the context within which— [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=0.0s)]
*  Because of that assassination. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And other actions that Israel has taken recently. We understand that the tensions are thick, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=6.32s)]
*  and we understand why. Certainly, the context here is important to remember in terms of what's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=13.36s)]
*  going on in the region. But I do want to say, from the beginning, it was Mr. Sinwar [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=19.2s)]
*  sitting in a tunnel somewhere in Gaza who's been the decision-maker—always has been—and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=24.48s)]
*  whether it's Mr. Haneeyah or some other Hamas political operative working with the mediators [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=30.88s)]
*  in Doha, the message still has to get back to him for him to approve or disapprove. So, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=36.0s)]
*  in essence, the mechanism here, the discussions, the negotiations, are going to follow a very [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=41.04s)]
*  similar sort of path and a similar process than they have in the past, with or without him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=46.08s)]
*  It was May 1st when the president announced a deal, and he announced that proposal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=51.84s)]
*  He said that Israel was fully on board with it. In all that time since, Israel has not indicated [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=60.0s)]
*  support for this deal publicly. At least the prime minister hasn't. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=67.68s)]
*  Well, they've admitted that it's their proposal. After the president laid out the framework, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=71.6s)]
*  the Israeli government came and acknowledged that that was, in fact, their basic proposal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=75.6s)]
*  There has been back and forth in the weeks since the end of May when the president announced the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=80.08s)]
*  proposal, and that's the way negotiations work. Amendments on both sides make changes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=85.6s)]
*  I'm not excusing anything, but what needs to happen in Doha right now, we've got to get some [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=90.72s)]
*  compromises made. There has to be some leadership shown. These gaps are narrow enough that they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=96.8s)]
*  absolutely can and should be closed, and we want to work towards that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  The president and the national security adviser, the secretary of state, have been firing up the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=106.72s)]
*  telephone lines trying to get everyone to persuade Iran not to retaliate in a big way [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=111.2s)]
*  for India's assassination. Is there any sign that Iran is listening? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  I would tell you that in addition to the intense diplomacy, we've also moved a lot of military [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=124.4s)]
*  capability into the region in case there is an attack. We don't want to see that outcome. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  I can't tell you what the supreme leader is thinking or what he's hearing and what may be [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=136.16s)]
*  impacting his decision calculus, but the rhetoric coming out of Tehran doesn't give us any comfort [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  that there won't be something coming. So we have to prepare for that. It could come with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  no notice, and it certainly could come in days. Hopefully that's not the outcome, but if it is, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=152.8s)]
*  we've got to make sure we're ready to help defend Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=158.4s)]
*  Hamas says that more than 40,000 civilians have been killed. We can't verify that number. No one [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  can from outside, but it's a lot of people. We've seen a lot of heartbreak. Israel is still [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=167.2s)]
*  targeting schools. They say that there are Hamas people hiding in the tunnel, fighters, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  but under international law, it's never okay to target a school. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=178.48s)]
*  Schools, hospitals, residences, we don't want to see combat in those areas. Certainly, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  hospitals and schools where little kids are trying to just learn and go about their daily [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=189.84s)]
*  lives, and it's hard enough in Gaza just to get food, water and medicine, let alone think [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  about going to school. There have been way too many civilian casualties. No question about that, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=199.12s)]
*  thousands and thousands and thousands, many times over, and it's too much, which is why, again, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=205.04s)]
*  the talks in Doha are so important. I don't want to be Pollyannish about it. There's an awful lot [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=210.56s)]
*  of work to get done here, but if we can get this deal in place and you get six weeks of a ceasefire, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=215.44s)]
*  nobody's shooting at anybody for six weeks. You can get more humanitarian assistance in, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=221.04s)]
*  and we can start to get to phase two, which could actually get us to an end to this conflict, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=225.68s)]
*  which is what the president's been working hard on. Finally, the National Security Council has [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=229.68s)]
*  worked tirelessly to get children, pediatric cancer patients, out through Kerem Shalom, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=234.32s)]
*  out for treatment, potentially in the U.S., and there was success today. Eleven children [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=242.16s)]
*  and their parents or guardians have come through. Seven others were inexplicably taken off the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=248.32s)]
*  approved list by the Israelis, by this group, COGAP, yesterday, the last 24 hours for some reason. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=253.2s)]
*  But tell us about the progress, and particularly the chief of staff of the NSC has been a hero. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=260.0s)]
*  Mr. Curtis Reid, our chief, has been working this personally very, very, very hard, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=266.56s)]
*  and of course, Mr. Sullivan, the national security advisor, right there with him. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=271.12s)]
*  Eleven pediatric children got there now in Jordan and getting the care that they [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=275.44s)]
*  so desperately need, and it is such a good story. We've now worked with St. Jude's to get more than [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  170 children out of Gaza and to the medical care that they need around the world. It's a tremendous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=286.32s)]
*  effort, but it is a team effort, and Curtis was here, he would say the same thing. He's working [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=293.84s)]
*  hard, but he's got a team of folks that help him and support him, and he's working with, again, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=297.84s)]
*  outside agencies. Certainly the Israelis, St. Jude's Hospital, have just done heroic work here to get [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=302.88s)]
*  this done, and we're not going to stop. We know there's more little kids that need desperate [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=308.32s)]
*  medical care, and we're going to stay at that task. I've got to ask you about Ukraine with this first [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=313.28s)]
*  incursion into Russian territory. They say that they've got 74 villages now under their control. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  Putin is embarrassed and furious. What are your fears that they've poked the bear and that he's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=325.52s)]
*  going to really hit them hard? There's not a lot I can say about the Ukrainian operation right now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=331.28s)]
*  I'll let them speak to this. We have seen the Russians react to it in terms of diverting some [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=336.64s)]
*  military manpower and resources to the Kursk area. Not clear to us exactly how much they're going to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  do or how many forces they're going to put there or what their intentions are or what they're going [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=348.24s)]
*  to do about what the Ukrainians are doing. We're talking to the Ukrainians in real time, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=351.76s)]
*  as you might imagine. We want to better understand what's going on here. In the meantime, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=355.92s)]
*  Andrea, we're going to continue to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons and capabilities that it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=359.92s)]
*  needs to defend itself. Cruise missiles? We're going to continue to talk to the Ukrainians. I [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=363.84s)]
*  don't have any announcements on capabilities to make today, but you will see us continue to roll [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  out packages of security assistance to Ukraine in coming weeks. John Kirby, as always, it's great [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  to see you. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF1RVPNwuXk&t=380.88s)]
