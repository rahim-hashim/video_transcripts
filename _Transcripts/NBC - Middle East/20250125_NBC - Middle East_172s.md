# BREAKING: Hostages return to Israel for treatment after release by Hamas
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug)
*  And we expect that probably in a moment or two that black van will follow the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=0.0s)]
*  route of its predecessor a couple of minutes ago and head off the helipads [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=7.12s)]
*  and back into that hospital. So we are waiting and watching now. Ali just to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=13.24s)]
*  give you a bit of a sense of the treatment here. Okay that that screen is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=22.52s)]
*  being pulled away. The side door of the van is closed and we think that they will [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=27.12s)]
*  probably head off. There we go. Slightly more muted cheering now from this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=33.52s)]
*  slightly thinned out crowd. But that second van and we're actually seeing now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=41.2s)]
*  some of the people in those orange high vis vests who had been securing the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=47.36s)]
*  screens. They applauded. Also they're giving each other high fives. They are now moving those [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=54.16s)]
*  screens away. So we think that that is probably it now. All four hostages, their [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  families, their support network loaded onto those black vans and heading into [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=66.92s)]
*  the helicopter. Ali just real quick we had a chance to talk last week to some [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=73.44s)]
*  of the doctors here about specific medical treatment for these freed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=77.36s)]
*  hostages. One of the things they mentioned is refeeding syndrome. If you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=81.56s)]
*  have people who haven't eaten in a long time who are malnourished, as a lot of people in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=85.08s)]
*  Gaza not just hostages are malnourished, you have to be careful about what you feed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=90.4s)]
*  them. You give them heavy meals, sugary meals, you can potentially send their [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=95.2s)]
*  bodies into shock. That can lead even to death in some cases. So they're thinking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=99.48s)]
*  very carefully about what they're going to feed them. They're thinking about [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=104.08s)]
*  sunlight. The concern had been some of these hostages may have been down in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  tunnels for extended periods. They may not have seen the light. Obviously these [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=111.5s)]
*  women were released before midday local time. They walked into a bright and sunny [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=114.78s)]
*  square in Gaza. They didn't appear to be having any issues that way. We do not yet [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=120.26s)]
*  know whether they were held in apartments, whether they were held [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=124.9s)]
*  underground in tunnels. But then you can just imagine that this is day one of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=127.5s)]
*  what is going to be a very, very long road to recovery for these women. A [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=132.82s)]
*  battery of tests for their physical health but also ongoing support for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=137.56s)]
*  their mental health, for their psychological well-being. And we did just [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=143.72s)]
*  see them heading in to take those first steps of what is going to be a long, long [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=147.4s)]
*  road. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=151.84s)]
*  you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1XImLSA7ug&t=167.56s)]
