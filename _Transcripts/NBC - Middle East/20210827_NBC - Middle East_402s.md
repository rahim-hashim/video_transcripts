# Kolenda On Afghanistan: 'Keep Our Eye On The Ball In Terms Of Action'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic)
*  And Courtney, we know now that the president's national security team is warning that another [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=0.0s)]
*  terror attack in Kabul is likely. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=4.96s)]
*  We heard the press secretary Jen Psaki describe the threat as active, ongoing, and acute. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=7.38s)]
*  And earlier today, the Pentagon spokesperson said the threats are specific and credible. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=13.56s)]
*  So how is the Pentagon preparing right now? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=17.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=20.16s)]
*  And it's, they're using the language, not just that there is, it's possible, but that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=21.36s)]
*  they expect more attempts and they expect another, another potential attack here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=25.52s)]
*  So it is very strong language. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=30.88s)]
*  Candidly, it's stronger than we usually hear in these kinds of situations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=32.28s)]
*  So what they're looking for here, Jeff, is the potential for another suicide attack. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=35.64s)]
*  And that could be in the form of someone with a suicide vest attempting to get access to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=40.24s)]
*  one of the gates, like we saw in this devastating attack yesterday. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=44.28s)]
*  They're also very worried about the potential for a vehicle-borne explosive device. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=47.5s)]
*  So someone packing a vehicle with some kind of explosives, and then the worst case scenario [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=51.16s)]
*  actually being able to drive it onto Kabul airport. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  The third thing they're still worried about are the potential for rocket attacks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  And in this case, it's someone being able, launching a rocket attack onto the airport [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=61.12s)]
*  grounds, whether it's parking up the runway or again, in a worst case scenario, being [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  able to attack and take out one of these aircraft, the C-17 aircraft carrying hundreds of potential [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=69.56s)]
*  of evacuees. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=77.08s)]
*  So this threat is continuing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=78.08s)]
*  It is very specific, according to the officials that we're speaking to, and the military is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=80.24s)]
*  continuing to plan for the eventuality, Jeff. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=84.38000000000001s)]
*  And Courtney, what more have you learned about yesterday's attack? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=86.7s)]
*  We know now that 13 U.S. service members were tragically killed in that terror attack. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=89.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  And we know a little bit more about the breakdown. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  There were 11 U.S. Marines, one sailor, a Navy corpsman, and one U.S. soldier killed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  in this attack. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  And we also learned a little bit more today, despite the fact that yesterday we were getting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=104.5s)]
*  there were two separate attacks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=109.62s)]
*  It was actually one suicide attack followed by some gunfire, a gun battle that broke out [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=112.62s)]
*  that was all at the Abbey Gate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=117.62s)]
*  There was not an explosion at the Barron Hotel, as was being reported for about 24 hours yesterday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  The reason behind this is in sort of the fog of the aftermath of these sorts of attacks, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=125.62s)]
*  there's often a lot of bad reporting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=130.9s)]
*  And in the hours after, we get more and more clarity on what actually happened. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=132.7s)]
*  So again, one explosion and then a gun battle that ensued all at the Abbey Gate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=136.66s)]
*  Courtney, QB, thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=142.18s)]
*  We're going to let you go. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=143.78s)]
*  And Mike Memley, given the ever-present threat, given the deadly attack yesterday, what is [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=144.78s)]
*  the White House saying about what this means for the evacuation process as this operation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=150.06s)]
*  winds down right now? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=154.7s)]
*  Well, Jeff, you hear that the White House is preparing for the end of one phase here, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=156.1s)]
*  the military drawdown ahead of that August 31st deadline. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=160.74s)]
*  And then the eventual transition to a much more uncertain phase on many levels, what [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=164.02s)]
*  happens without the U.S. military presence when they're still making a commitment to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=169.18s)]
*  be getting out any Americans and our Afghan partners that remain? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=173.02s)]
*  In terms of the former, the drawdown of the military presence, this is a very sensitive [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=176.86s)]
*  period. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=181.46s)]
*  You've heard that from a number of officials, both at the White House and the Pentagon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=182.46s)]
*  You heard the White House press secretary last night, I asked her about the potential [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  of exploding some of the equipment that remains here from the Americans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=189.12s)]
*  She would not confirm that, pointing to the Pentagon. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=193.86s)]
*  And you heard from the Pentagon press secretary earlier that as they get closer into this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=196.22000000000003s)]
*  critical period over the weekend, they're going to be giving less details, frankly, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  because of the sensitivity of the operations at this point. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=203.66000000000003s)]
*  But Saki did come with new numbers today about the efforts to get Americans specifically [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=206.4s)]
*  out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=210.66000000000003s)]
*  We're now over 5,100 Americans who have been evacuated since August 14th. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=211.66000000000003s)]
*  Remember, 6,000 was the estimate that Secretary of State Tony Blinken offered earlier. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  And then the question is, what happens after August 31st? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=221.26s)]
*  The president indicated yesterday that efforts to get people out would continue. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  But without the military there, what does that look like? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  The Taliban, you heard Saki say this several times, this is not a matter of trusting them, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=230.98s)]
*  but they believe that they still have leverage over the Taliban to try to facilitate an ongoing [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=236.42s)]
*  effort. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=240.62s)]
*  Does that include State Department personnel at something of a makeshift embassy there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=241.62s)]
*  at the airport? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=245.66s)]
*  What other allied efforts are going on, including with the Turks potentially to secure the airport? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=246.7s)]
*  This is a very interesting period that we're heading into once they engage in the very [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=251.38s)]
*  sensitive and very dangerous, as they've endlessly been repeating over the last few days period [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=256.66s)]
*  that we're in in the next few days. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=262.06s)]
*  And then, Jeff, just to underscore what a perilous moment this is for the White House. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=263.52s)]
*  You had a briefing there with a significant focus on Afghanistan, of course. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=267.34s)]
*  You heard it at the end there, the preparations that are underway for a potentially major [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=271.88s)]
*  hurricane bearing down on Louisiana here over the weekend. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=275.82s)]
*  And then the ongoing fight against COVID. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=279.7s)]
*  This is obviously a White House that's battling many battles on many fronts. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=282.14s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=286.02s)]
*  And Colonel Christopher Kalenda, I want to bring you in on a point that Mike Memley was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=287.02s)]
*  making about what does this evacuation process look like after the end of the month? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  Can the Taliban be counted on to help facilitate that process? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=295.64s)]
*  How would this work? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=299.64s)]
*  I think, first of all, my heart goes out to the people who lost their lives and their [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  loved ones yesterday, both American and Afghan. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=306.86s)]
*  There were, in addition to the 13 service members, 90 plus Afghans who lost their lives. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=309.5s)]
*  And I know what it's like to be a commander and have your soldiers killed in action and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=315.70000000000005s)]
*  you're grieving, you're adapting, and you're driving on with your mission all at the same [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  In terms of the Taliban, it's difficult for Americans to wrap our minds around the idea [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=325.22s)]
*  of working together with a group of people that we've been fighting for the last 20 years. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=331.14s)]
*  And I found when I've negotiated with insurgents that it's important to create some space between [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=336.9s)]
*  emotion and action. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=343.94s)]
*  So acknowledge the emotions that you're feeling, frustration, outrage. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=345.3s)]
*  And I hope the administration acknowledges those things that Americans are feeling. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=349.42s)]
*  You can hear it in the questions in the last press conference. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=353.06s)]
*  And then second, we need to keep our eye on the ball in terms of action. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=358.86s)]
*  So we've got three main actions that we've got to do. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=362.22s)]
*  First, get the evacuees out, American citizens, SIV refugees, et cetera, continue that process. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=365.06s)]
*  The second is the address, help working with Afghans to address the humanitarian crisis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=374.14s)]
*  Over 20 million Afghans facing acute food and water shortage, an ongoing economic collapse, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=378.86s)]
*  and then the human rights concerns. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=385.82s)]
*  And of course, number three is the counterterrorism. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=387.7s)]
*  So we're going to take one of two options. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=390.58s)]
*  One is turn our backs on Afghanistan. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=392.58s)]
*  The second option is to stay engaged in Afghanistan. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=396.38s)]
*  The second one is where we achieve our interests. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEUqCpHWic&t=399.14s)]
