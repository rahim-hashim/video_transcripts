# Sen. Van Hollen: U.S. ‘should not rush into war’ with Iran, Trump ‘doesn’t have’ authority
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Senator of Maryland and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=4.4s)]
*  Senator, always good to see you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=5.4s)]
*  What are the conversations that you're having and that you're hearing about these resolutions [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=7.68s)]
*  and how much support you think they have? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, Chris, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=15.32s)]
*  And the Constitution is very clear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=18.12s)]
*  Presidents do not have the power to declare war unilaterally. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=20.96s)]
*  Only Congress has that power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=25.72s)]
*  And so I strongly support the efforts to file a War Powers Resolution, Senator Keynes here [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=27.44s)]
*  in the Senate, and a bipartisan resolution in the House. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  The United States should not rush into war. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=38.36s)]
*  We shouldn't be dragged into a war with Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=41.72s)]
*  And certainly the president doesn't have the authority to simply wage war against Iran [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=45.06s)]
*  without congressional action. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=50.78s)]
*  So I hope, I believe that, look, as you well know, among Republicans, there's a real split [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=53.44s)]
*  on the issue. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=59.48s)]
*  You've got the bombs away on Iran today group, and then you've got those who said, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=60.48s)]
*  President Trump said he was the no wars president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=67.48s)]
*  He was the president of end wars. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=69.6s)]
*  And so that's the debate going on among Republicans. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=71.24s)]
*  Well, let me ask you about the debate going on, I think, among Democrats as well, because [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=73.28s)]
*  we've heard people use phrases like we're at a major turning point, we're at a pivotal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=78.32s)]
*  juncture. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=82.84s)]
*  Donald Trump himself said today, you know, something big indicated could happen in the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=83.92s)]
*  next week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm just getting some stuff from Capitol Hill from one of your colleagues, Senator Kelly, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  who's on the Intel Committee, as you know, spoke to our Ryan Nobles and said, I get briefed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=95.16s)]
*  on it practically every week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=99.64s)]
*  I see where they are. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  They're close, incredibly close. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=102.76s)]
*  So how do you see this moment and the level of danger and what should happen as a result [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=105.84s)]
*  of it? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=111.16s)]
*  Well, Chris, we've always said that it would be unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=113.16s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=118.28s)]
*  The question is, how do you do that? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=119.28s)]
*  And as you know, the president's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was scheduled to meet with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=121.36s)]
*  his Iranian counterparts in Oman on Sunday. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=126.36s)]
*  And then, of course, the Netanyahu government launched this attack. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=130.8s)]
*  And so those talks were scuttled. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=134.6s)]
*  So you know, we had an approach back during the Obama administration. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=137.04s)]
*  It was called the JCPOA. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump tore it up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has always opposed the negotiated approach. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=144.6s)]
*  But that's the approach we should take as Americans rather than to get America dragged [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  into this conflict and, you know, put the lives of our servicemen and women at risk. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  Those of us who opposed the war in Iraq remember how we got caught up into that war and, in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=159.2s)]
*  my view, a very costly war where we did not ultimately achieve our goals. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=166.76s)]
*  Let me read to you some of what your Republican colleagues have said just today. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, gotten by our folks who are on the ground there on Capitol Hill, our correspondents. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=177.28s)]
*  Senator Rounds, who says no option should be off the table for President Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=182.88s)]
*  Senator Kennedy supports Trump unconditionally on eliminating Iran's nuclear capability. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=187.48s)]
*  Senator Kramer says we are more susceptible than we've ever been to a foreign attack. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=193.88s)]
*  And here's what another of the Republican colleagues, Bernie Moreno, told reporters [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=199.6s)]
*  about how he views the president's approach to Iran. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  President Trump is the least likely president of the United States ever, again, in my lifetime, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=208.44s)]
*  to lead a country in a war. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=216.16s)]
*  That's not his intent. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=218.52s)]
*  So he doesn't need to be constrained because he is the constraint. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=221.04s)]
*  So I think what he's doing is putting together a deal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=224.64s)]
*  Look what he did with India and Pakistan. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that was never really reported. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=228.16s)]
*  You had two nuclear powers that were about to go at it against each other, and that's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  almost like it never happened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=234.84s)]
*  I think you're going to see the same thing in the Middle East. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=235.84s)]
*  And by the way, I hope all of you call for a Nobel Peace Prize for President Trump when [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=238.28s)]
*  this is all done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=241.6s)]
*  I won't ask you your opinion on the Nobel Peace Prize, but I will ask you about the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=243.06s)]
*  that this is a president who consistently, even before he was president or when he was [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=248.04s)]
*  not president of the United States, argued against an interventionist policy, what he [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=253.64s)]
*  saw as a dangerous policy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=258.7s)]
*  So what do you say to the Bernie Morenos who say, listen, he's a guy who's going to constrain [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=261.38s)]
*  himself. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=266.0s)]
*  He doesn't need you and a resolution to constrain him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, Chris, just first of all, for the record, the Indian government denied that Donald [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=271.88s)]
*  Trump or his administration had anything to do with their entering into the ceasefire [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=277.2s)]
*  with Pakistan. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=281.12s)]
*  But it's not me or my colleagues. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=282.84s)]
*  This is the Constitution of the United States. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=284.14s)]
*  And I know President Trump said a few weeks ago that, you know, maybe he doesn't have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=286.62s)]
*  to comply with the Constitution of the United States, but he does. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=290.92s)]
*  And I would hope my Republican colleagues would recognize that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=294.3s)]
*  So, you know, if Senator Moreno is right, what he's saying is that Donald Trump's not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=298.88000000000005s)]
*  likely to go to war against Iran. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't think we should go to war against Iran. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=307.68s)]
*  And so let's see what happens here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=311.24s)]
*  But based on what President Trump's been saying, many of us think it's important to remind [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=314.26000000000005s)]
*  him that he doesn't have the power to do that without congressional authorization. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=320.12s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen, always appreciate you taking the time to come on the show. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Ha-K7lbbY&t=328.52s)]
