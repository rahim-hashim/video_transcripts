# What is the impact of Sinwar's death? Amb. Pinkas weighs in
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c)
*  I want to bring in Ambassador Allen Pinkett. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, let me go to the ambassador quickly, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=2.56s)]
*  because you were a former top advisor to the Israeli prime [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  minister, Zahud Barak Shimon Peres. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=7.28s)]
*  You were the consul general in New York City. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=9.36s)]
*  What's the impact of this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=12.52s)]
*  What are your hopes for the hostages? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=13.72s)]
*  Well, the impact, it's going to take a few days [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=16.96s)]
*  before we can make an intelligence assessment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=19.32s)]
*  There are several things that are clear. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=23.84s)]
*  Whether or not Sinwar exerted his leadership [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=27.88s)]
*  in an authoritative way in the last few months is questionable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=31.88s)]
*  What is definite now is that the entire Hamas chain of command [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  has been disrupted to the point of being [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=42.76s)]
*  dysfunctional and defunct. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=45.16s)]
*  And that makes it difficult to deal with, not easier to deal [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  with. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=51.92s)]
*  It's not like they're going to surrender en masse. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=52.42s)]
*  The second point is, Andrea, is whether or not [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=55.6s)]
*  this could prove the reason, the pretext, the justification [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=60.2s)]
*  to end the war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=64.88s)]
*  Because outside of total conquest and occupation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=66.84s)]
*  of the entire Gaza Strip for a long duration of time, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=73.44s)]
*  every single military objective has been achieved. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=77.32s)]
*  What we haven't seen are any political objectives. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=80.88s)]
*  No post-war plan, complete refusal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=84.64s)]
*  to engage President Biden when he came out with his plan [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  late in December 2023. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=91.88s)]
*  The third point is, and I think Richard Engel raised it, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=95.16s)]
*  and perhaps others too, and that is that there could be vengeance [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=98.24s)]
*  exacted on the hostages. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=104.52s)]
*  They could be executed because there's no chain of command, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=105.92s)]
*  as I mentioned. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=108.56s)]
*  And you never know who's going to just make a decision, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=109.76s)]
*  an on-spot decision, to just execute and murder [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  innocent hostages. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  And the fourth point, if I may, goes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  to something I think very important [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=121.2s)]
*  that you mentioned, Andrea, just before you got [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  the confirmation of his death. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=125.84s)]
*  You said something that he was in the Israeli prison, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=128.08s)]
*  well, he was for 23 years, of course, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=130.4s)]
*  and that he was first in Israel and Israeli politics. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=135.0s)]
*  But look at an interesting thing here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=136.0s)]
*  There are two terrorists, two leaders, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=138.32s)]
*  Hassan Maslala of Hezbollah, dead, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=141.92s)]
*  Yachiyah Senwar of Hamas, dead, both of which [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  were considered by Israel as regional experts on Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=149.56s)]
*  And look how badly they miscalculated and misconstrued [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=153.44s)]
*  and misinterpreted what Israel will do after such an attack. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=158.24s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=164.12s)]
*  And [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2a3phiKh7c&t=165.4s)]
