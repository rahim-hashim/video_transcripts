# Richard Engel: Situation Getting More Dangerous, Chaotic In Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE)
*  Welcome back to Morning Joe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Live pictures at 3 53 in the afternoon at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan on the eve [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=2.92s)]
*  of America's evacuation and withdrawal after nearly 20 years of war there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=8.88s)]
*  The United States military is working to evacuate hundreds of Americans still looking to leave [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=13.24s)]
*  the country before tomorrow's deadline set by President Biden. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=17.84s)]
*  According to the latest numbers provided by the State Department, approximately 250 US [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=20.96s)]
*  citizens are still in Afghanistan. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=25.64s)]
*  Since August 14th, the United States says it has evacuated more than 122,000 people, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=28.36s)]
*  including more than 1200 since yesterday morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=33.56s)]
*  As for the thousands of Afghans who worked with the US military who have not yet been [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=36.96s)]
*  evacuated, the New York Times reports their window to be airlifted has closed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=41.2s)]
*  The Times says a text message was sent out late Saturday, which read in part, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  We regret to inform you that international military evacuations from Kabul airport have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=51.2s)]
*  ended. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=55.92s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Angle from Doha, Qatar. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Richard, good morning. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=62.0s)]
*  What is your sense on the eve of this withdrawal of how many people, how many Americans, how [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  many Afghans who want to get out remain at the airport trying to leave the country? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=68.68s)]
*  Well, this has been a violent race to the exit and it is getting more and more dangerous, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=76.0s)]
*  more and more chaotic in this last phase. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=82.88s)]
*  We are less than 24 hours to go. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  And this morning there was a rocket attack on the air base being blamed on ISIS. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=88.44s)]
*  The US is coordinating with the Taliban. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  The US and the Taliban in coordination are trying to prevent ISIS from disrupting this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=96.08s)]
*  process. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  The US has now conducted two strikes against ISIS, including one in Kabul. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  And the Taliban are saying that the Kabul missed its target and hit and killed a family. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=108.2s)]
*  So as these evacuations, as evacuees are trying, hoping to get on one of these last flights, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=115.92s)]
*  the Americans are saying, sorry, it's over. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=124.52s)]
*  The window is closed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And they're conducting this mini drone and car bomb and rocket war with ISIS right in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=128.64s)]
*  the 11th hour. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=136.4s)]
*  So you have a tremendously complicated situation where the US is trying to pull out, trying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  to pull out safely, trying to guard the perimeter, and then these last Americans, like the ones [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  who got those text messages saying you're just going to have to wait it out, we're done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=147.6s)]
*  The gates are closed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Those who are inevitably going to be left behind or who feel that they had a good reason [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  to leave, that they didn't get a chance to make their case, they didn't have the appropriate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=160.08s)]
*  paperwork, are now going to face potentially a long wait. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=163.92s)]
*  They're going to have to wait until they get their documents, until the civilian airport [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=168.76s)]
*  opens, or they could potentially make their way to one of the land borders up toward Central [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  Asia, Iran, or Pakistan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  And it's not clear when the airport is going to open. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=182.56s)]
*  There were some talks that the airport was going to open in coordination with the Qataris [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=184.72s)]
*  and with the Turks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=188.88s)]
*  It could take weeks for that to happen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=191.4s)]
*  Could be less, but there's been a significant amount of damage at the airport itself, and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=194.96s)]
*  the pilots are simply not going to fly if they don't have the right reassurances. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  So we're racing toward the exit. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=207.16s)]
*  It's a violent race to the exit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=209.68s)]
*  People are going to be left behind, and they're going to be very, very stressed, to put it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=211.52s)]
*  lightly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=217.44s)]
*  Taliban is saying that it's not hunting anyone down, that it's not going to bother people, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=218.48s)]
*  that it will allow people to leave. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=223.0s)]
*  And then the question is, can they be trusted? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=225.68s)]
*  Can they be taken at their word? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's the big question, Richard. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  You've covered this war for 20 years. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=230.6s)]
*  You've covered the Taliban very closely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=232.48s)]
*  You've been in among them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=234.2s)]
*  They've said the right things, like a PR effort for the last couple of weeks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=235.8s)]
*  But the sense from people I talk to is they're saying the right things until that last American [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=240.28s)]
*  plane lifts off, and then it's back to their usual medieval business. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=244.2s)]
*  So what is your sense of what Afghanistan will look like on Wednesday? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=248.42s)]
*  Well, the Taliban are being nudged by many different actors, Qatar among them, but not [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=256.14s)]
*  only. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=262.18s)]
*  And they are being nudged in the right direction. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=263.18s)]
*  They are saying to the Taliban, you can't go right back to the way you were. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=265.94s)]
*  The people won't accept it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  You're going to face an insurgency. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  You're going to be ostracized by the international community. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=274.06s)]
*  You will be hated. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=278.38s)]
*  You don't want to do this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=279.38s)]
*  And there are many in the senior Taliban leadership who agree with this, who want to try and have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=281.14s)]
*  a fresh start, want to have Taliban light, if you will, where they still control the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=286.73999999999995s)]
*  basic tenets of society based on a strict form of Sharia, but not anything like the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  rule that they had in the 90s. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  So a lot of it will also depend on how the world reacts to the Taliban. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=301.5s)]
*  If the world tries to encourage them along, tries to bring them out, maybe it could help. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=307.78s)]
*  If the U.S. suddenly slaps sanctions on them, they could have a negative reaction, retrench [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  and retract. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=320.26s)]
*  And so the Taliban are trying to explore this new territory. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=322.06s)]
*  They are saying the right things. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  And they're saying the right things for a reason, because people around them are telling [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  them to say the right things. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=333.4s)]
*  Some of them believe this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=334.62s)]
*  They do want to try differently. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=336.3s)]
*  They do want to not antagonize an entire new generation of Afghans. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=337.7s)]
*  But I think a lot of this will depend on how the world reacts. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=343.56s)]
*  Are they going to be embraced? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  Will they suddenly get hit by sanctions? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=348.6s)]
*  Will there be events on the ground overtake them? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=351.1s)]
*  Will there be more airstrikes against them? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=356.26s)]
*  So I think talking to them that there are enough in the senior leadership that they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=359.97999999999996s)]
*  do want to give it a try. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=365.7s)]
*  But the question is, what is their version of giving it a try and how receptive is the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=369.29999999999995s)]
*  world going to be to a new and claimingly rebranded Taliban? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  John. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L8iuu3HWE&t=379.9s)]
