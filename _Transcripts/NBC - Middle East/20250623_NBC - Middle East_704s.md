# Nicolle Wallace on Iran: ‘Trump and his own VP seem to be on different pages about regime change’
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI)
*  We come on the air with an incredibly volatile, fast-moving situation unfolding right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=6.12s)]
*  A few hours ago, Iranian missiles targeted a U.S. base in Qatar. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=7.12s)]
*  It is home to 10,000 U.S. military and civilian personnel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  This video on your screen right now shows the moment when missiles were intercepted. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=16.44s)]
*  Loud booms were heard in Qatar's capital. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=20.88s)]
*  A defense official tells NBC News that there are currently no reports of casualties. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Those strikes happened after the U.S. had warned American citizens in Qatar to shelter [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=28.4s)]
*  in place, anticipating such an attack. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=33.28s)]
*  Now the region and thousands of U.S. service members deployed in the region are waiting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  for whatever else unfolds. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=41.12s)]
*  An official telling NBC News that the Pentagon is aware of imminent threats against bases [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=44.14s)]
*  across the Middle East, not just in Qatar. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=49.04s)]
*  The big question right now is whether Iran will continue to retaliate against the U.S. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=51.72s)]
*  and whether Iran's nuclear program is crippled but still viable after those Israeli and U.S. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=58.08s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  There is brand new reporting on just how we got here so quickly that raises even more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=65.2s)]
*  questions on how Team Trump is going about handling delicate, fragile, important and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=69.96s)]
*  consequential decisions regarding U.S. foreign policy as this crisis unfolds in the Middle [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=75.98s)]
*  East. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=81.58s)]
*  New reporting in The New York Times reveals that Donald Trump was influenced seemingly, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=82.8s)]
*  first and foremost, by Fox News, obsessed with looking like a winner in their coverage [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=88.84s)]
*  and a Pentagon that scrambled to contain any possible damage to the operation that Donald [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=94.88s)]
*  Trump's narcissism could cause. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=100.42s)]
*  As one official tells The Times, quote, the president was the biggest threat to OPSEC. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  That means operational security that the planning faced. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=110.92s)]
*  The New York Times also reports that the White House's statement that Trump would decide [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=112.04s)]
*  on whether to strike Iran, quote, within the next two weeks was always a ruse. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=116.16s)]
*  It's never true. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=120.76s)]
*  He'd already decided to launch a military operation when that statement was delivered [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=122.04s)]
*  by the sitting White House press secretary whose salary is paid for by the American taxpayer [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=127.8s)]
*  from the podium. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=132.84s)]
*  But that two-week statement had the effect of, quote, cleaning up a mess, the telegraphing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=134.8s)]
*  of the attack that was partly of the president's making, end quote. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  That mess was caused by Trump's unhinged and almost ceaseless social media posts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=143.96s)]
*  Everyone should evacuate Tehran, unconditional surrender in all caps, among others, according [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=149.0s)]
*  to The New York Times. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  Those posts, quote, generated angst at the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command, where military [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=154.84s)]
*  planners begin to worry that Trump was giving Iran too much warning about an impending strike. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  They built their own deception into the attack plan. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=165.94s)]
*  A second group of B-2 bombers that would leave Missouri and head west over the Pacific Ocean [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  in a way that flight trackers would be able to monitor on Saturday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  That left the misimpression for many observers and presumably Iran about the timing and path [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  of the attack, which would come from another direction entirely. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=184.44s)]
*  That is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=189.0s)]
*  New York Times Washington investigative reporter Mark Mazetti's here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=192.0s)]
*  His byline is on that reporting we read from. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=195.6s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling joins us as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  NBC News national security correspondent Courtney Cuey will join us from the Pentagon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=201.52s)]
*  Oh no, she's there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  She's there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=207.76s)]
*  She made it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=208.76s)]
*  Courtney, you're here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=209.76s)]
*  Oh, in a minute. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=210.76s)]
*  In a minute. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=211.76s)]
*  Let me start with you, Mark Mazetti, and this incredible body of reporting about how we [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=212.76s)]
*  got to where we arrived Saturday and where we find ourselves today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=217.56s)]
*  Take us through it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=220.84s)]
*  Well, it was sort of the chaotic eight days from the time that Israel first struck more [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=222.84s)]
*  than a week ago inside of Iran to the American strike Saturday night in Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=230.0s)]
*  And it was this period where the president sort of was projecting publicly that he hadn't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=236.76s)]
*  made a decision. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=243.08s)]
*  But increasingly as the days went on, he moved closer and closer to making a decision. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=245.04s)]
*  And by early last week, he had pretty much decided that he was going to authorize an [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=249.68s)]
*  American military strike on Iran. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=256.12s)]
*  And that was the time when American military planning was sort of ramping up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=258.54s)]
*  Obviously, the military had been looking at these sites for years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  There had been plans on the shelf to attack Fordow and Natanz and other places. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  But obviously they had to refine the attack. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=274.72s)]
*  This sort of played out in amidst a time when the president was posting on Truth Social [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=277.5s)]
*  these very provocative statements, for instance, about everyone in Tehran needs to evacuate. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  And this was causing angst at Central Command and the Pentagon that he seemed to be signaling [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  that something was coming and that might be potentially damaging to the attack. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=295.14s)]
*  Mark, what is your understanding of the facts of the attack? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=301.86s)]
*  We were on the air together Saturday night. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=307.66s)]
*  Thank you for coming in late with us. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=309.58000000000004s)]
*  But Trump's statement to the country at 10 p.m. Eastern was that the U.S. had, quote, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=312.86s)]
*  obliterated Iran's nuclear program. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=317.94s)]
*  His own chairman of the Joint Chiefs was more—didn't say that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=320.54s)]
*  He said that they're still assessing what damage was done. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=324.94s)]
*  What is your understanding of the success of the bombings? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=328.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=333.17999999999995s)]
*  When we spoke on Saturday night, I was saying how surprised it was that the president would [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=334.17999999999995s)]
*  sort of make this blanket statement immediately after the strike that the nuclear facilities [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=340.34s)]
*  had been totally obliterated. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, the Pentagon generally wants to take some time to assess the damage before [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=347.97999999999996s)]
*  making any kind of judgments. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=352.29999999999995s)]
*  Sure enough, by Sunday morning, there were more tempered statements about just how much [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=354.3s)]
*  damage there was. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=359.86s)]
*  Now, we still are trying to learn more about just the extent. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=361.3s)]
*  And I think the United States and Israel are also trying to learn as much as they can. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  They're still trying to assess the damage of those sites. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=368.78s)]
*  That could take some time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=370.98s)]
*  But it was—the message of American officials on Sunday, hours after the president had made [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=372.74s)]
*  those statements Saturday night, was certainly different and certainly more measured, indicating [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=378.82s)]
*  that Iran obviously has some capabilities remaining for its nuclear facilities, but [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=383.42s)]
*  also the suggestion that there were efforts by the Iranians to relocate a lot of the enriched [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=388.98s)]
*  uranium from the sites that were the most obvious targets of an American attack. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=396.74s)]
*  General Hurley, let me ask you to come in as our sort of arbiter of what is true. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=401.42s)]
*  It's such an extraordinary moment where—it's always a solemn moment, but when a president [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  takes the country into war, into a military operation, and then addresses the nation, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=417.73999999999995s)]
*  what's so stunning is that, as Mark is pointing out, by the next morning, his chairman of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=426.46s)]
*  the Joint Chiefs was communicating something different about the mission. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=431.29999999999995s)]
*  What is your understanding of the facts of what has transpired since Saturday night? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=436.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, a couple of things on the facts, and it's a great point to bring out, Nicole, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  because obliterator, first of all, is not a doctrinal term. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=448.14s)]
*  Truthfully, it's hyperbole. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=449.78s)]
*  Secondly, whenever you're doing bomb damage assessment, the so-called BDA, you underplay [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=451.7s)]
*  it until you have more facts. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=457.02s)]
*  And even if you have something like a small explosion somewhere that is under the control [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=459.17999999999995s)]
*  of a commander, only the inexperienced and those who are swaggering will say that it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=463.73999999999995s)]
*  created something more than they know it did before they had experience and a good [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=470.3s)]
*  look at what had happened. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=476.3s)]
*  So something like this in an area where there's no one around, that it's 90 feet underground, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=477.98s)]
*  under granite and concrete, where the bombs enter a hole and you see perhaps the concussion, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=484.7s)]
*  but not the explosion, you're guessing at where the facilities are, and you don't quite [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=490.86s)]
*  know what you're going to hit, even though the warhead is extremely powerful. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=496.7s)]
*  Truthfully, as an inexperienced commander, I would never say something like it's been [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=501.18s)]
*  obliterated. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=506.78000000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't even say it was defeated or destroyed until you had evidence of that happening. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  And truthfully, Nicole, I've got to admit that I've been the victim of that on several [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=514.14s)]
*  occasions during my military career where we overhyped something that didn't turn out [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=518.66s)]
*  to be true. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=523.58s)]
*  So that was the first touch. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  When I heard the president say that, I winced. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  When I heard General Cain the next morning back away from that and say that it would [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=530.66s)]
*  take several days, perhaps even weeks to determine the real bomb damage assessment, I said, OK, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=535.5799999999999s)]
*  we've got a guy that understands this, especially an Air Force guy who has probably been involved [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=541.54s)]
*  in launching weapons systems from 30,000 feet and can't really tell until there's more evidence [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=546.98s)]
*  on the ground what's there. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=552.86s)]
*  So that entire dynamic of the initial press conference doesn't give facts. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=554.64s)]
*  It doesn't allow for the citizens to trust what is coming out of a press conference. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=560.72s)]
*  And that's my thought about the whole thing, because truthfully, facts matter in situations [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  like this, especially when you're sending military forces off to war. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=571.12s)]
*  Well, and I do, there are, the events are unfolding as we have been on the air. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=575.6s)]
*  And I'm going to bring our viewers all that information. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=582.04s)]
*  But I wanted to back up to Saturday night because I was on the air as it was unfolding [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  and it wasn't clear to me what the facts were. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you one more factual question. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=592.6s)]
*  Do you understand or do you believe the military understands what the objective of the raids [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=595.36s)]
*  were? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=600.52s)]
*  Because even since it happened, Trump and his own VP seem to be on different pages about [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=601.52s)]
*  regime change. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=608.72s)]
*  That's also a great point, because I was involved in the 2003 planning for the invasion of Iraq. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=610.12s)]
*  And when the mission set is given to a military force, you want it in a clear, understandable, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  concise statement. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=622.64s)]
*  What am I supposed to do? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  Eisenhower probably got the best ever one when Marshall told him, enter the continent [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=625.6s)]
*  of Europe and defeat the Nazi war machine. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  I can do that as a military guy. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=633.2s)]
*  What I can't do as a military guy is regime change. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=635.6s)]
*  I certainly can't do it with a bombing campaign. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=638.88s)]
*  So I'm sure the mission set that was passed through CENTCOM to the Air Force and the Navy [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  was hit these specific targets. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  It was a target synchronized matrix. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=652.12s)]
*  So they knew what they had to hit. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=654.62s)]
*  They knew when they had to hit it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=656.74s)]
*  They were looking at the headquarters, the central command headquarters, for effects [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=658.56s)]
*  of the weapons system. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  That has nothing to do with the changing dynamic from striking a nuclear facility all the way [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=665.1400000000001s)]
*  to the next day talking about regime change. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=671.74s)]
*  Because I got to tell you, the military don't do regime change, and we certainly don't [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=675.46s)]
*  do it very well. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=680.5s)]
*  Sorry for my grammar there. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLvkVvYb9ZI&t=681.5s)]
