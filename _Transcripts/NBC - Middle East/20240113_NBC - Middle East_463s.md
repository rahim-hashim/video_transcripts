Video Description: There is bipartisan opposition to President Biden’s decision to authorize military strikes targeting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen without congressional approval, launching a fierce debate in Washington over war powers. Since November, the Houthis have launched more than two dozen attacks on ships in the Red Sea - a critical passageway for global commercial shipping. The Biden administration says the U.S. strikes are meant to protect those key shipping routes. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, top progressive Democrat in Congress, joins Ali Velshi to discuss.

# 'There are serious consequences': Top progressive Dem on Biden’s strikes in Yemen
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE)
*  Joining me now is the congresswoman, Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and a vocal critic of the White House's decision to engage in military strikes without congressional authorization. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=0.0s)]
*  Representative Jayapal, good to see you as always. Thank you for joining us. Let me ask you just to clarify, what is it that you're objecting to? Is it the object of the strikes themselves or is it that the president engaged in them without congressional approval or both? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=9.0s)]
*  It is the latter. It is that the president engaged in these strikes without seeking congressional approval. And this is a long debated issue, of course, because Article One of the Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. Article Two gives the power to the president to direct military forces as commander in chief. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=24.0s)]
*  And so just backing up, in 1973, amidst a disastrous war in Vietnam and the ways in which the United States was pulled into that conflict little by little, Congress decided to reassert our congressional authority by passing the War Powers Resolution of 1973. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=44.0s)]
*  And in the War Powers Resolution, it specifically articulated the instances where the president can initiate use of force and military actions that commit United States forces. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=65.0s)]
*  And there were three instances. One was a declaration of war. Two is statutory authority is given. And three is instances where the United States faces an emergency attack on the United States or on its possessions or territories. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=79.0s)]
*  Now, the intent here was to say that the president must be in consultation whenever possible with Congress. And in fact, Section three of the War Powers Resolution says that it specifically says in every circumstance where possible, the president must consult with Congress so that we have both Congress and the president weighing what the course forward should be. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=95.0s)]
*  In this situation, Ali, what the president did is consult with a huge number of allies. It took weeks. And in fact, you know, the White House was telegraphing that there was going to be some retaliation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=121.0s)]
*  So there was certainly time and space to come to Congress and consult with Congress and ask for our authority, particularly given that the reason that the Houthis and you know, this is a violent extremist group. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=133.0s)]
*  We obviously have to deal with the Houthis, but particularly because the Houthis were saying that the reason that they're doing this is because of the war in Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=148.0s)]
*  And so I think that the implications of all of this are that the United States could be pushed into a significant set of hostilities and committing of our resources. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=160.0s)]
*  And that is something that Congress should consider. I don't think we can anymore say that we are in danger of the Gaza war spreading. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=174.0s)]
*  It is already happening and it's happening right here before our eyes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=180.0s)]
*  So I suppose you're calling Gregory Meeks yesterday and he was saying that the president did inform Congress. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=184.0s)]
*  There's a distinction here in what you're talking about about informing Congress versus consulting with Congress. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=192.0s)]
*  Some might say you're splitting hairs. Others might say we got ourselves into a war for a very long time in Iraq. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=199.0s)]
*  And by the way, Vietnam, which was never a war, it was a it was always some kind of action. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=205.0s)]
*  So the War Powers Act was meant to constrain the president, not give them extra freedoms. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=209.0s)]
*  That's right. And there is a big distinction. It isn't splitting hairs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=215.0s)]
*  It is a big distinction between informing and consulting with and seeking authority from Congress. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=219.0s)]
*  And so in this case, you know, that third instance that I mentioned of when there's an emergency attack in that situation, the president must inform within 48 hours, must inform Congress. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=227.0s)]
*  And and so I think that this situation is one where clearly there was the time and space and the intent of Congress in the War Powers Resolution was to say that in every circumstance, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=239.0s)]
*  Democratic president, Republican president, whatever the circumstance is, we need to ensure that Congress is consulted. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=251.0s)]
*  And again, I would just say that particularly given the circumstances here, given that this is in the Middle East, given that, you know, Israel's war on Gaza is continuing and it has significant consequences for us to be drawn in as the Houthis want us to be drawn in, I would argue. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=260.0s)]
*  I think that this is absolutely a circumstance where the president is required to consult with Congress and I think needs to come to us now and ask for authorities for anything further that they intend to do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=278.0s)]
*  I'm an economics guy, so I'm very interested in the shipping routes and things like that. Definitely a valid economic concern. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=291.0s)]
*  I wasn't sure how that constituted an imminent threat to the United States. When I talked to Congressman Meeks and I said, well, why did the president have the ability to take this action without consulting Congress? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=298.0s)]
*  And he felt that the Houthis had demonstrated their ability to threaten U.S. interests and certainly had launched some attacks in that direction. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=308.0s)]
*  The argument being it needed to be done quickly as opposed to the process of getting approval from Congress. What's your take on that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=318.0s)]
*  Well, look, certainly the United States and our allies have an interest in defending the freedom and the shipping routes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=328.0s)]
*  They are very important economically. But again, I would just say what is the problem with coming to Congress and asking for our authority? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=336.0s)]
*  Again, given the context of this particular situation, it's even more enhanced, I think. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=345.0s)]
*  But that is not a reason. That is not what the War Powers Resolution says is any threat that's out there is a threat and therefore the president has the right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=352.0s)]
*  No, it says that and it specifically says this within the War Powers Resolution that in any situation where the president can consult with Congress and ask authority of Congress, he or she should do that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=363.0s)]
*  And so that is the situation here. We've had weeks where the president could come to Congress and say, this is the plan. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=380.0s)]
*  In fact, I had a conversation yesterday with the top State Department official where they explained all of their rationale. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=386.0s)]
*  Well, great. Come explain it to Congress. Let us have that conversation, because in my mind, this is both about how we protect our shipping routes, but it is also about the war in Gaza and how do we make sure that that that does not expand? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=393.0s)]
*  There are serious consequences here, and that is why I've been, as you know, calling for a ceasefire, because violence does beget violence and we have to stop ourselves from getting pulled in to these conflicts with more violence because it will have long term ramifications. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=407.0s)]
*  That is what happened exactly as you as we talked about in the Vietnam War in other conflicts. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=424.0s)]
*  And that is why in 1973, Congress said we are going to reassert our our constitutional authority. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=429.0s)]
*  Congressman, always good to talk to you. Thank you for taking the time to join with us this morning. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=437.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZLc8efksE&t=454.0s)]
