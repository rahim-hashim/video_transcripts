# Defeating Donald Trump: One lawyer's true story
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ)
*  At Trump University, we teach success. That's what it's all about. Success. It's going to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  happen to you. If you don't learn from them, if you don't learn from me, if you don't learn [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=6.36s)]
*  from the people that we're going to be putting forward, and these are all people that are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=11.44s)]
*  hand-picked by me, then you're just not going to make it in terms of the world of success. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=14.8s)]
*  I think the biggest step towards success is going to be sign up at Trump University. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=20.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, the thousands of people who were ripped off by Donald Trump's defunct fraudulent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  business school, Trump University, they might disagree with his lessons for success. The [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=31.48s)]
*  $25 million settlement in that 2018 Trump University case was at the time Trump's first [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  and only major legal loss. A new book by the attorney who took on and beat Trump in that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=41.32s)]
*  case offers a playbook for how prosecutors can do the same in their cases against the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=47.24s)]
*  former president. And joining me now is former New York Assistant Attorney General Tristan Snell, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  author of Taking Down Trump, 12 Rules for Prosecuting Donald Trump by Someone Who Did [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=55.96s)]
*  It Successfully. Big welcome. We're going to talk about the book in a second. I have to say I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=61.0s)]
*  enjoyed the smiles that were on your faces as you were listening to Donald Trump and that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  self-promoting thing about a fraudulent university. But let me ask you about Fonny Willis, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  because the situation there, she has now admitted that she indeed is now in a relationship with a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  personal relationship with a special prosecutor in the case. And Willis argues the relationship [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=80.2s)]
*  has not corrupted her ability to oversee the case, but from what you deserve, has she violated [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=85.48s)]
*  any legal ethics? And would it be something that would be either disqualifying to her case [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=90.68s)]
*  or for the betterment of that case should she step aside? Give me your thoughts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  As for whether it's a legal ethics issue, that's for the state of Georgia to decide. And I really [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=103.64s)]
*  feel like that's a bureaucratic question that is completely separate from the merits of this case. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=108.68s)]
*  And we're talking about something that's a, you know, look, it could be something significant. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=115.64s)]
*  I have no idea. But the kicker is that the gravity and the weight and the size of this case against [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=120.28s)]
*  Trump is in completely different proportion to anything that Willis may or may not have done here [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=127.16s)]
*  with her relationship here. Okay. We're going to get to the book now, Taking Down Trump. It is a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=133.72s)]
*  five-year bid that you had to hold Donald Trump accountable as you faced him. Tactics we've all [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=139.48s)]
*  become familiar with, right? I mean, we can look at him refusing to comply with subpoenas, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=145.72s)]
*  attacking plaintiffs, accusing a judge of being biased against him. We've heard that time and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=149.88s)]
*  time again. Let's take a listen to part of Trump's deposition in the case. Here's part of that that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  you know well. You can't answer the question as to whether or not when educators deliver less than [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=158.28s)]
*  promised for more money and claim they're doing something great. It's fraud, pure and simple. I [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=164.84s)]
*  would say it's, it's no, it's not fraud. It's trying to get a point across. It's not accurate. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=169.72s)]
*  It's not accurate. Yeah. It's trying to get a point across. And yet you have written that this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=176.68s)]
*  particular case almost didn't happen? Many, many times. It almost didn't happen. Wow. Yeah. There [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=182.36s)]
*  were a lot of internal political battles to actually get this thing out to see the light of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=188.76s)]
*  day. And a lot of what I write about in the book is how do we actually get these prosecutors, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=193.56s)]
*  whether they're elected or appointed, to have the courage and the assertiveness to get in there and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=199.0s)]
*  actually bring a case, which is separate from the merits. Let's assume there are merits. If there [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=206.04s)]
*  are not merits, the case should not be brought. But this case was very meritorious, but it was held [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=209.8s)]
*  up for about a year. And a lot of these other cases that we've seen, DOJ and the FBI held up the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=214.76s)]
*  January 6 investigation of Trump and his inner circle. They did not really dig into that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=220.76s)]
*  investigation for a whole year until I think the January 6 committee forced their hand. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  We saw it with Alvin Bragg, where basically the Trump case was put on hold for a year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=231.56s)]
*  He kaboshed it. Then he brought it back. Public pressure is a big part of how you make these cases [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=236.44s)]
*  go. But that is something that Jack Smith has shied away from. So what do you think about his tactic [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=242.6s)]
*  relative to that? Well, I think the key there is that DOJ is going to be very sensitive to this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=250.12s)]
*  because it's the Biden administration. You're not going to see anything look like they're trying to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=256.12s)]
*  politicize this case. And they shouldn't because it would be improper and it could backfire on them [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=261.32s)]
*  with the election and everything else. I do think that Jack Smith, and this is one that gets into [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=266.44s)]
*  some of the other rules in the book, I think they need to really push out there in the media while [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=271.8s)]
*  these trials are going on. Don't make it political, but just share with people the facts, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=277.96s)]
*  shine a light on things that happen in the courtroom. The DCJ6 case, we're not going to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  have cameras in the courtroom. We're going to have print reporters do their best to relay to all of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  us what was going on inside that courtroom. And then Donald Trump's going to be out there on the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=292.76s)]
*  courthouse steps with his lawyers, lying, lying, lying, lying the whole time and twisting everything. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  We need to make sure that DOJ is out there. It may not be Smith, but there have to be people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=303.08s)]
*  that have media savvy that are going to be able to factually and clearly explain to everybody what [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=308.12s)]
*  was going on in that courtroom. Kind of like what we saw Tiss James doing. I think they did a great [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=314.12s)]
*  job with that. I think DOJ needs to do the same thing. Let me ask you about the book though. You [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=317.88s)]
*  have 12 rules that you say this is how you go about doing it when you take down Donald Trump. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=321.56s)]
*  Are any of the cases out there right now following your playbook? I'd say pretty much most of them [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=327.56s)]
*  are. I do think that there are some things like what I want to see from DOJ. Not that it's up to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=333.16s)]
*  me, but it'd be great to see from DOJ that they actually really tell a story, not just to the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  jury that they're going to be facing, but also to the media and to the public. They did do a good [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=344.68s)]
*  job of that in the indictment. I think the indictment was very clear. You didn't need to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=350.92s)]
*  be a lawyer to understand what was going on with it, but we need to see them make that case to the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=355.0s)]
*  people because we're not going to be able to see what's going on in the courtroom. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=360.35999999999996s)]
*  What we've seen with these cases is the dogged determination to get to the bottom of these things [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  has been happening and that's why these cases are being successful. What was your assessment [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=369.32s)]
*  of the prosecution when it came to the E. Jean Carroll case? That civil case, they did a great [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  job. I think now we're starting to see so many people be able to follow these rules that now [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  we're seeing private litigants, not just government authorities, be able to bring these. I think that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  Carol and her lawyers led by Robbie Kaplan, I think they did a fantastic job of this. I cite [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=390.2s)]
*  to numerous examples of their work in the book and I think we saw an even greater example of it with [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=395.0s)]
*  the new verdict that we got in the $83 million. So listen, this is a great book and for those who are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=400.44s)]
*  not a lawyer but would have kind of dreamed of being one, it's great. You can read all about it [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=405.96s)]
*  in the book. I'm glad to have it. You think about it. That would be actually a good legal tactic. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=410.36s)]
*  Thank you so much Tristan. We will see you again soon. Again, the book, Taking Down Trump, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=414.2s)]
*  12 Rules for Prosecuting Donald Trump by Someone Who Did It Successfully. Thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gat5gqBYSxQ&t=417.96s)]
