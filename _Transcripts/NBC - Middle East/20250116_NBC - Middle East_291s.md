# 'I think it will get done': Foreign policy scholar on deal between Israel and Hamas
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk)
*  of the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=0.0s)]
*  Advanced International Studies, as well as being a columnist for Bloomberg opinion, Hal Brands. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=4.32s)]
*  His new book is titled, The Eurasian Century, Hot Wars, Cold Wars, and the Making of the Modern [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=9.28s)]
*  World. How good to see you, Danielle, just well detailed the distrust that the families of these [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=14.64s)]
*  hostages have for the Netanyahu government. These deals have been close before and have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=19.76s)]
*  fallen apart. This does seem to be the closest yet, and we heard the reassuring words from [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=25.04s)]
*  Admiral Kirby a few moments ago. But give us your assessment of the lay of the land and walk us [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=28.4s)]
*  through the pockets of resistance that Netanyahu is facing within his own coalition. Can you get [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  by them? For a number of months, the big challenge politically in Israel was that Netanyahu would [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=38.48s)]
*  perhaps lose the support of the farthest right members of his own coalition if he were to go [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=45.76s)]
*  for a hostage deal. That danger has receded more recently because he has brought another party into [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=50.4s)]
*  his government that gives him a little bit more margin for error. And the other thing that this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=58.24s)]
*  hostage deal does, which is critical in Israeli political context, is it punts on the issue of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=62.88s)]
*  whether this is an end of the war or simply a timeout while Israel gets back as many hostages [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=68.64s)]
*  as it can. And the Israeli government has left itself the option of renewing the war [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=76.48s)]
*  after the first phase of this ceasefire is complete if it cannot get satisfaction on the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=81.36s)]
*  release of the remainder of the hostages and other critical issues. So Hal, let's talk about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=87.04s)]
*  the historic nature of what happened on the American side with an outgoing president and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=94.4s)]
*  an incoming president, different parties who really don't like each other on a personal level. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=102.0s)]
*  Working together, more importantly, there are people working together to bring this deal in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=109.04s)]
*  to a landing. Do you think despite the reservations and concerns from the most extreme [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=114.0s)]
*  members of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition that this deal will get done at the end of the day, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=120.48s)]
*  in part because of Donald Trump's popularity in Israel? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=127.68s)]
*  I think it will get done. I think this is—it's still the Middle East, and so no deal is final [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=132.64s)]
*  until it's final, and sometimes it's not done even at that point. But I do expect that the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=137.2s)]
*  deal will ultimately get done because both parties are pretty well incentivized to do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=142.08s)]
*  It's been interesting on the American side where we've basically had two presidents negotiating [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  this deal. So you've had the Biden administration involved, but then President Trump and his [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=151.28s)]
*  representatives have been involved as well. And the interesting thing here is that Trump has [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=155.44s)]
*  actually been pushing for this deal to get done on Biden's watch, which is unusual. We all remember [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  the end of the Iran hostage crisis when the hostages weren't released until just after Ronald [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=167.68s)]
*  Reagan had taken the oath of office. But I think what Trump has calculated is that he doesn't want [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  the Gaza issue swallowing his presidency in the way that it swallowed the last year of Joe Biden's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=178.8s)]
*  presidency. And so he simply wants to get it off the table so that he can move on to other priorities [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=184.88s)]
*  in the region and beyond. So, Hal, in a moment, we're going to be diving into the hearings yesterday [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=190.24s)]
*  of Secretary of State nominee Senator Rubio. But give us your assessment of some of the challenges [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=196.16s)]
*  he faces in your expertise, your age there. Obviously, the war in Ukraine still rages, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=201.04s)]
*  even as there's some suggestion that this year, 2025, might be the year where both sides are [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=207.28s)]
*  willing to get the negotiating table. From a U.S. policy perspective, if you get a ceasefire in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=212.4s)]
*  Gaza, it's really out of the frying pan and into the fire. You're just moving into the next phase [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=218.32s)]
*  of a Middle Eastern crisis, which will revolve primarily around the Iranian nuclear program and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=223.04s)]
*  the Trump administration's efforts to come to grips with that. But the really challenging issue, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=228.16s)]
*  I think, is going to be Ukraine, where Trump initially promised in that war within 24 hours. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=233.44s)]
*  Now he said, give me six months. And I think the basic challenge, the basic dynamic there is that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=238.56s)]
*  Ukraine is losing the war. It's losing slowly, but it is losing. And so the U.S. and Ukraine and their [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  friends are going to have to find a way of putting more pressure on Russia simply to get to a point [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=250.08s)]
*  where a ceasefire might be feasible. All right. An important conversation we'll be continuing to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  have. The new book, The Eurasian Century, Hot Wars, Cold Wars, and the Making of the Modern World, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  is indeed on sale now. Author Hal Brands. Hal, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=264.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsPvy7Q6eIk&t=280.08s)]
