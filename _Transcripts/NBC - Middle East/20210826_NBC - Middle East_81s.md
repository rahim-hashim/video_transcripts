# Retired Admiral: Very unlikely US Would Launch Counterattack Against ISIS-K
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY)
*  Is there, are there realistic targets for ISIS-K that are identifiable right now, or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=0.0s)]
*  is that a bit complicated given that, I mean, look, our intelligence seemed to be solid [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=7.32s)]
*  enough that we were forewarned about this attack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=15.64s)]
*  So what is your sense of how quickly we could acquire targets if we wanted to? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=20.0s)]
*  My sense is we could, in fact, find and exploit targets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=24.84s)]
*  It would be a big mission, a long-range mission. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=30.48s)]
*  We'd have to coordinate it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=34.4s)]
*  We wouldn't have to, but we would probably need to coordinate it with the Taliban. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=36.04s)]
*  I think it's very unlikely that we're going to want to do it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=40.84s)]
*  It would be low bank for the buck. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Think about those tomahawks we launched, Chuck, against Bin Laden way back in, you know, the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=45.96s)]
*  1990s that almost got him and got his training camp. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=53.0s)]
*  Really doesn't have much effect. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=56.92s)]
*  I doubt we'll go that way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6iayUZyY&t=58.8s)]
