# Hostage's brother on fight for his return: 'We pray for a ceasefire every day'
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE)
*  One year ago tomorrow, Hamas unleashed the worst terrorist attack on Israel in its history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Around 1,200 people were killed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=6.68s)]
*  Of the 251 taken hostage that day, 97 remained captive. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=8.52s)]
*  And ever since, stability in the Middle East has deteriorated. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, Israeli airstrikes on a mosque and school sheltering refugees in the Gaza [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Strip killed 24 people and injured 93 others. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=21.56s)]
*  The IDF said it had conducted, quote, precise strikes on Hamas terrorists operating in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=25.36s)]
*  the facility. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=30.72s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry reported today that 41,871 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=31.72s)]
*  military operation since the October 7 attacks last year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=39.2s)]
*  In Lebanon, here's new video showing another airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  There's still no word on casualties from this latest strike. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=49.64s)]
*  In an excerpt of an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes, Vice President Harris said the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=54.16s)]
*  United States remains committed to reaching a ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Now the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=64.0s)]
*  around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=77.8s)]
*  and create a ceasefire. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=85.44s)]
*  And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=87.12s)]
*  including Arab leaders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=92.12s)]
*  The year-long wait for a permanent ceasefire agreement has been especially painful for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  the families of Hamas's hostages. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=99.24s)]
*  At least 33 of the 97 people still being held captive in Gaza today are believed to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=101.96s)]
*  be dead. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  Protesters gathered around the world this weekend to call for the remaining hostages [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  released and hear from those freed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=113.8s)]
*  63-year-old American Israeli Aviva Siegel was one of dozens released during a temporary [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=117.32s)]
*  ceasefire last November. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  She spent almost two months in captivity with her husband, Keith, who is still being held [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza today. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=131.2s)]
*  I've been married to Keith for 43 years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  Most of the times we weren't allowed to even whisper. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=138.0s)]
*  So we used to just look at each other in the eyes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=141.76s)]
*  I will not allow myself to lose my hope because if I do, who will scream for Keith? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  Keith Siegel is now one of the last four American hostages thought to be alive. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=151.44s)]
*  His wife says he was shot in the hand and broke several ribs while they were being [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=157.12s)]
*  abducted on October 7th. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=161.8s)]
*  Joining me now is Keith Siegel's brother, David Siegel, who joins me now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=165.68s)]
*  Mr. Siegel, thank you very much for coming to the Sunday show on the eve of a—I hesitate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  to call it an anniversary because anniversaries connote celebration. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=178.4s)]
*  This is nothing to celebrate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=182.84s)]
*  How are you and the family feeling? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=184.94s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=188.22s)]
*  It's been a year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=193.02s)]
*  And when October 7th happened, we were immediately in steady communication with our family in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  Israel as well as our family in the States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=202.22s)]
*  And although those who've been involved in hostage release negotiations in other settings [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=205.94s)]
*  told us these kinds of things can go on for a long, long time, we couldn't believe in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=212.14s)]
*  that moment that a year from then Keith would still be a hostage. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=218.42s)]
*  You know, over several times we have heard President Biden say that the framework of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=225.1s)]
*  a ceasefire deal is there only to see those efforts thwarted. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=232.6s)]
*  And I use that word ceasefire deal on purpose because you don't like the word deal when [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=238.32s)]
*  talking about ceasefire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  You prefer ceasefire agreement. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=245.54s)]
*  What's your issue with the word deal? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=247.42s)]
*  It connotes other kinds of negotiations in my mind, not when you're talking about people's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=250.2s)]
*  lives and family members. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=257.96s)]
*  It sounds like a business transaction. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=260.48s)]
*  And there does need to be an agreement around a ceasefire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=264.12s)]
*  We pray for that every day for Keith's release, for the release of the other hostages, and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  for the end of all the death and destruction that's accompanied this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=275.68s)]
*  In an interview with my MSNBC colleague, Jose Diaz-Ballard, your sister-in-law, Keith's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=280.24s)]
*  Segal said that she believes that Keith believes he's been forgotten. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=287.88s)]
*  Do you believe Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to get Keith and the remaining [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=295.92s)]
*  hostages released? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=300.48s)]
*  What we want is for all leaders who are in a position to influence whether the hostages [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=303.12s)]
*  are released or not to do whatever they can do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=309.36s)]
*  It's not clear to us that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made release of the hostage his highest [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=313.44s)]
*  priority. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=320.68s)]
*  And that's disturbing to us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=322.56s)]
*  How concerned are you that the effort to hold Hamas accountable for October 7th has now [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=326.44s)]
*  expanded to include the retaliation of Hezbollah? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=336.72s)]
*  How concerned are you that this expansion is taking attention away from your brother, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=344.68s)]
*  from the remaining hostages there being held by Hamas? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=352.16s)]
*  Well I think what's now going on in Lebanon and between Hezbollah and Israel does not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=356.0s)]
*  make it easier to find a ceasefire agreement. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  And in that way it confounds the attempts to bring this to an end and bring Keith and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=365.88s)]
*  the other hostages home. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't see how it couldn't. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=375.16s)]
*  I'm not a diplomat, I'm not a military person, I can't really speak to the strategic dimensions [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=379.0s)]
*  of it, but in answering your question it's another front and another confrontation that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  would seem to make it difficult for the parties to sit down with mediators and find an agreement. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=392.32s)]
*  Final question for you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=400.28s)]
*  If you had the opportunity right now, if by some miracle both President Biden and Prime [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=401.28s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu were right here, what's the one thing you would tell them on the eve [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=407.36s)]
*  of the one-year mark? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it's important to point out that the Biden administration has been exceptionally [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  accessible to us and communicative with us about all the efforts that they're putting in. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=421.32s)]
*  If they were sitting in front of me I would say you are the leaders of two countries that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=427.88s)]
*  are in a position to strongly influence the establishment of an agreement and a ceasefire [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=433.68s)]
*  that would bring my brother home and I need you to do that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=440.84s)]
*  David Siegel, brother of Keith Siegel who has been held by Hamas for 364 days, thank [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=447.0s)]
*  you for coming to the Sunday show. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=454.2s)]
*  My thoughts, our thoughts and prayers are with you, your family, but most importantly [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=457.56s)]
*  with Keith Siegel. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=464.28s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wzxa1qtDE&t=465.28s)]
