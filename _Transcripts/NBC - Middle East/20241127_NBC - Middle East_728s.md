# 'The result of relentless diplomacy': Israel and Hezbollah ceasefire begins
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE)
*  Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has now taken effect, bringing an end to more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=0.0s)]
*  than a year of fighting. NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=4.8s)]
*  the latest. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=9.52s)]
*  Just hours after new Israeli strikes against Hezbollah targets in Beirut, the Iranian-backed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=11.92s)]
*  militia the U.S. designates as a terror group. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=16.92s)]
*  I have some good news to report from the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=19.64s)]
*  President Biden announcing both sides have agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=22.2s)]
*  Let's be clear. Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=25.32s)]
*  war either. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=33.12s)]
*  The latest conflict started a day after the October 7th Hamas attacks when Hezbollah began [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=34.12s)]
*  firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel. With the deal, some 80,000 Israelis who evacuated [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=39.46s)]
*  from the north can now go home, while Lebanese officials say more than 3,000 of its citizens [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=45.96s)]
*  have been killed, more than one million displaced by the Israeli strikes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=51.48s)]
*  Israel's prime minister backing the ceasefire, saying it is no longer the same Hezbollah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=57.12s)]
*  We have set it back decades. Netanyahu also saying Israel has killed Hezbollah's leader [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  and its top deputies, destroyed most of the group's missiles and rockets, killed thousands [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=66.78s)]
*  of terrorists and destroyed their tunnels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=72.08s)]
*  Netanyahu also saying Israel reserves the right to resume fighting if Hezbollah breaks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  the ceasefire and he'll now focus on the threat from Iran, while President Biden is hoping [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=79.12s)]
*  for a deal in Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=84.44s)]
*  People of Gaza have been through hell and Hamas has refused for months and months to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=86.34s)]
*  negotiate a good faith ceasefire and a hostage deal. And so now Hamas has a choice to make. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=92.64s)]
*  Their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=101.52s)]
*  Andrew Mitchell reporting there. Joining us now, White House National Security Advisor, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=108.04s)]
*  Jake Sullivan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=111.4s)]
*  Jake, good morning. Good to have you with us. So if you can now that this is out in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=112.4s)]
*  the open, now that this has taken effect and been announced by the president, take us back [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=116.08s)]
*  a little bit to the origins of this deal, how you got to a place that some people thought [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=120.04s)]
*  was impossible, which is a ceasefire. Again, with the caveat, we'll see if it holds from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=124.56s)]
*  both sides, but how you got Hezbollah to the table, how you got Israel to agree to this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=129.6s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=134.7s)]
*  Well, as you know, Willie, and first, thanks for having me. This war began the day after [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=135.83999999999997s)]
*  October 7th, the day after Hamas launched that brutal massacre of Israelis on October [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=142.6s)]
*  7th. It began because Hezbollah started firing at Israel and they have fired consistently [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=149.1s)]
*  for months and months. They have forced tens of thousands of Israeli citizens from their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=155.33999999999997s)]
*  homes. And so Israel fought back. And what we have seen over the course of the last few [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  months is that Israel has been able to badly degrade Hezbollah, take out their terrorist [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=163.9s)]
*  infrastructure, eliminate their top leaders, destroy their rocketed missile stockpiles [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  to the point where Hezbollah does not represent anything like the organization it was before [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=174.62s)]
*  October 7th. That has put Israel in the position to come to the table from a position of strength. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=179.1s)]
*  And on the side of Lebanon, the people of Lebanon did not want this war and did not [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=185.68s)]
*  want to be held hostage in the war by Hezbollah. And so the stakeholders in Lebanon also were [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  prepared to come to the table. But it required intense, persistent American diplomacy over [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  months led by President Biden, driven by our envoy, Amos Hoxstein, coordinated in this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  building behind me. And it finally culminated in the ceasefire that took effect this morning. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  This is a good step in the Middle East. There is more work to do in Gaza and elsewhere, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  We believe that this is the beginning of an opportunity for a more stable Middle East [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  in which Israel's security is assured and U.S. interests are secured. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=222.98s)]
*  As you know well, of course, and everyone watching the show knows at this point that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=227.06s)]
*  Hezbollah is an Iran-backed group. What role did Iran have in reaching this settlement? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=230.42s)]
*  Iran was not involved in the negotiations. But of course, Hezbollah doesn't make decisions [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=237.26s)]
*  completely independently of Iran. So surely behind the scenes, there were consultations [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=243.3s)]
*  between Hezbollah and Iran. But at the table was the United States with the support of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  countries and allies like France, and then representatives from Lebanon on one side and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=252.74s)]
*  Israel on the other side in indirect negotiations. And at this point, beyond Hezbollah being weakened, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  Iran itself has been weakened. Its main proxy ally in the Middle East, Hezbollah, is now a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  shadow of its former self. And we have been able to achieve all of this, Willie, without the United [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=269.22s)]
*  States being dragged into a war in the Middle East. And that is a good thing. Now we turn our [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=273.94000000000005s)]
*  attention to try to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza and then build for a brighter [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=278.26000000000005s)]
*  future in the Middle East. And we don't know how long it will take to achieve that, but we will use [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=282.98s)]
*  every last day we have in office to try to achieve it. So, Jake, good morning. Jonathan Lemire, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=287.38000000000005s)]
*  following up on that exact point, we heard from President Biden yesterday vowing once again [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  to bring home American hostages there in Gaza to get that deal done. Can you update us as to the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=295.86s)]
*  status of talks? There have been a number of occasions in recent months where it felt like [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  a deal was imminent and then fallen apart. What's the latest from Hamas? And do you have buy-in also [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  from Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel? President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu before [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=311.3s)]
*  going out to announce that the ceasefire had been accepted by both sides. Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=317.22s)]
*  agreed with President Biden that we should take another run at getting a good deal, a good ceasefire [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=322.26s)]
*  and hostage deal that brings hostages home, including American citizens. And President Biden [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  intends to begin that work today by having his envoys engage with Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, and other [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  actors in the region. There have been ongoing indirect contacts through the mediators with Hamas [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=342.18s)]
*  in recent weeks. We believe that now that we have a ceasefire in Lebanon, the pressure will only grow [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=347.78s)]
*  on Hamas to reach a deal. I can't predict if and when it will happen, but I can tell you that we [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=353.38s)]
*  are going to put every ounce of effort we have into making it happen and getting those hostages [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  home. Mike Barnicle, we were talking to David Ignatius a moment ago saying in this region, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=363.14s)]
*  you have to, even if it's for a moment, celebrate when diplomacy prevails because it is so rare, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  and it has done so in the case of this ceasefire. There's reason to celebrate, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=375.38s)]
*  obviously, Willie, but there's a fuse always lit in that region of the world. And Jake, I'd like [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  to ask you about that fuse that remains burning in some places in the Middle East. There's the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  President of the United States, there's the Secretary of State Tony Blinken, there's Amos [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=393.14s)]
*  Hoechstein, as you just mentioned, there's you, there's Brett McGurk, there's Bill Burns, the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=397.38s)]
*  director of the CIA. All of you coordinated around a single goal of getting the ceasefire done. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=402.18s)]
*  So a ceasefire has been implemented for the moment. Could you talk about the degree of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=408.98s)]
*  difficulty in coordinating all of these efforts, all of these various trips to various countries [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=414.18s)]
*  in the Middle East and coming up to a point where there seems to be success for the moment [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=419.54s)]
*  and maybe further success down the road? How hard has this been? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  I think it's a great question, Mike, and the answer is very, very hard. It's never easy to achieve a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  day like today in the Middle East, and in particular, given just the extent and the depth of the conflict [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=434.9s)]
*  we've seen over the last year, it was particularly difficult. I would just make three points. First, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=441.94s)]
*  diplomacy doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens backed by deterrence and by military deployment [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=447.38s)]
*  that can shape the decisions of our adversaries. And at critical moments over the last year, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=454.74s)]
*  President Biden coordinated here at the White House with the Defense Department to deploy American [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  aircraft carriers, American fighter squadrons, and even a sophisticated American air defense battery [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=464.58s)]
*  to Israel to send a clear message that we were going to defend Israel and deter our enemies. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=470.9s)]
*  So that helped set the conditions. Second, at critical moments, the United States backed Israel [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=476.34s)]
*  in the steps it took to dismantle terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon so that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=481.86s)]
*  it could look its people in the eye and say, this deal will allow you to return to your home safely. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=486.98s)]
*  And then third, as you said, the intensive conversations that were required in Israel, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  in Lebanon, in Europe with France and other allies, at the United Nations, in other places, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  all of that is, in a way, a multi-dimensional game of chess that has to be coordinated out of this [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=504.18s)]
*  building behind me, led by the president of the United States and executed by that group of people [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=510.9s)]
*  you just said. We are proud of what we have accomplished. But your point that we can't rest [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=515.78s)]
*  on our laurels because this now needs to be implemented and now further ceasefires need [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=520.9s)]
*  to be achieved. It means we're rolling up our sleeves to go back to work. Jake, your successor, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=525.22s)]
*  the incoming national security adviser, Congressman Mike Walz celebrated, touted this deal yesterday. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=529.78s)]
*  He posted on X though saying this, everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=535.3s)]
*  His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won't be tolerated. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=540.74s)]
*  I'm glad to see concrete steps toward de-escalation in the Middle East. There is this idea that some [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=545.38s)]
*  countries and some even terrorist groups are falling in line because they believe a new [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=551.38s)]
*  administration might be tougher on them. What's your response? Well, first, we've had good [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=555.22s)]
*  coordination with the incoming team and I've kept Congressman Walz apprised at every step of the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=560.5s)]
*  way, including yesterday as we were closing this out. I'm glad to see that they're welcoming it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=565.7s)]
*  I would just say that it makes me particularly proud to have achieved this because you know [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=570.58s)]
*  you've done a good thing when other people want to take credit for it. So as far as I'm concerned, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=574.9000000000001s)]
*  this is positive for America. I'm not here to talk about credit. I'm here to report to the American [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaycmLhAMhE&t=580.6600000000001s)]
