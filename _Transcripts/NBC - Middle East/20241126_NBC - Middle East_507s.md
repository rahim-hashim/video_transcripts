# 'Biggest question' is whether Netanyahu will replicate ceasefire deal with Hamas: Haass
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA)
*  So, first of all, one of the big issues here was that Hezbollah, backed by Iran, of course, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=0.0s)]
*  was insisting that there be a ceasefire in Gaza, which is the much harder deal to negotiate [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=8.0s)]
*  with Hamas, and a release of the hostages before they would even consider a deal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=14.52s)]
*  But I'm told by U.S. officials that there was a breakthrough there, that when they decided, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=18.64s)]
*  when the U.S. decided to separate the two—and so they're basically acknowledging, to me, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=23.64s)]
*  that they're not likely to have a ceasefire in Gaza before President Biden leaves office, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=30.0s)]
*  which is, of course, a huge disappointment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=35.56s)]
*  But at least in Lebanon, these people, these Israelis have been displaced since October [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=37.88s)]
*  8th of last year, and a million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=42.64s)]
*  Well, a couple of reactions, Andrea. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  It's been a long time you and I have been having these conversations about the Middle [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=49.84s)]
*  East. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=53.64s)]
*  This is a rare day of some good news, so let's just acknowledge that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=54.64s)]
*  It's too soon to say—it's impossible to say whether it will be a permanent ceasefire. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  The idea, though, that it could be a long-term one, again, would mark real progress. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=64.88000000000001s)]
*  And as you correctly point out, critical here was Hezbollah dropping the linkage. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=70.44s)]
*  They had required that there also be a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=75.84s)]
*  I think they were so badly hurt by what the Israeli intelligence services did and then [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli military did, they were really back on their heels. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=83.72s)]
*  So this, again, this is, I think, a reflection of that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=88.28s)]
*  And we'll see what happens, you know, whether it's implemented, and then Hezbollah, I expect, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=94.64s)]
*  will try to reconstitute itself in some ways. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=98.56s)]
*  So this doesn't solve the problem, but that's asking too much. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=101.16s)]
*  It's, again, important progress. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  But again, as you point out, Gaza is far more difficult. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=106.88s)]
*  And one of the reasons is this is not ideological in the North. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=110.72s)]
*  The territory, this area between the Latani River and the border between Lebanon and Israel, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  this is not contested, if you will, holy land. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=119.28s)]
*  This is nothing ideological here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=123.04s)]
*  But when it comes to the Palestinians, whether it's in Gaza or the West Bank, that puts you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=125.36s)]
*  in the middle of Israeli politics, in the middle of what glues this government together. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=130.16s)]
*  So the idea that this will be a building block or a stepping stone, you'd have to be a real [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=137.72s)]
*  optimist for saying that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=142.88s)]
*  As you say, President Biden won't get a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=144.64s)]
*  The real question, I think, is whether Donald Trump could. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=148.2s)]
*  And I think the answer is he could. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=151.4s)]
*  But he would have to be willing to put some pressure on this Israeli government. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=153.48s)]
*  And we'll see whether he is willing to do that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  And as you rightly point out, we've had so many ups and downs and some great moments, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=160.96s)]
*  peace signings. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=166.6s)]
*  But this is, at least in the current climate and the current context, is the best news [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=167.8s)]
*  we've had since October 7th, a year ago, aside from that one week in Thanksgiving exactly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=173.76s)]
*  a year ago when we did get some hostages out and there was that one week ceasefire. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=180.2s)]
*  The hostage families whom I've spoken to, many in Israel are upset because Gaza is not [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=185.92s)]
*  part of this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=190.64s)]
*  But there's also the feeling by some American hostages I've spoken with that this might [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  increase the pressure on Hamas and give more leverage to Israel and the US negotiators [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=196.72s)]
*  and the Arab negotiators to try to get something done. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=203.88s)]
*  And the hope would be to get it done. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=206.68s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  It shows Hamas that they're more isolated than they realize. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  It also shows that Iran is willing to distance itself from one of its proxies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  I actually think the critical question now is more this Israeli government, whether this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=221.36s)]
*  coalition would allow Bibi Netanyahu to go ahead with the ceasefire and if they weren't, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=225.84s)]
*  whether he would be prepared to go to the polls to try to form a new government, his [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  political reputation, his political standing, as you know, has bounced back significantly [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=239.24s)]
*  over the last few months, in part because of Lebanon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  The military gains there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  And this ceasefire agreement, if it holds, will also really help Bibi Netanyahu's political [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=248.28s)]
*  standing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=254.44s)]
*  So it's possible that this would give him some of the political, what, maneuvering room [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=256.08s)]
*  that he hasn't had to take on the far right in Israel. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=261.04s)]
*  So this could be a very interesting moment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=266.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump may inherit, again, words like opportunity in the Middle East are rarely [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=268.48s)]
*  mentioned in the same breath. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=273.84s)]
*  But Donald Trump could find himself with some opportunity here diplomatically. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=275.76s)]
*  Well, a couple of points, because this really was a US negotiated deal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  We're giving some credit to France, but it was shuttle diplomacy by US diplomats that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  really made this happen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  And there were a lot of hangups in the last couple of days over Israel's insistence that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=290.32s)]
*  they could go back in if his bill violates it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=293.76s)]
*  Secretary Blinken has been with the G7 in Italy, and he just went on camera. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=296.76s)]
*  He's having a news conference. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=301.56s)]
*  Not to announce this, wanted to defer, of course, to President Biden to put something [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=303.18s)]
*  out later today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=308.32s)]
*  But we now expect that Netanyahu himself in the next hour is going to say something. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  But here's Secretary Blinken. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=314.36s)]
*  We're in the final stages of securing a ceasefire agreement for Lebanon. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=316.12s)]
*  We're not there yet, but I believe we are in the final stages. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  This has been an intensive diplomatic effort by the United States, partners like France, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  working with Israel, working with Lebanon over many months. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=335.8s)]
*  And as you so rightly point out, Richard, smartly point out, of course, that this does [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  give Netanyahu some running room, because going into Lebanon and getting these families, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=346.56s)]
*  more than 60,000 families, have been out of their homes since October 7th, getting them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=353.0s)]
*  back is almost universally supported in Israel, unlike aspects of Gaza and the hostage negotiations. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=357.76s)]
*  There is so much support for this gallant, told reporters here in Washington months ago, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=365.32s)]
*  in July, you know, we're done in Gaza. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  We really should be finished in Gaza. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=373.88s)]
*  We've accomplished our goals. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=375.76s)]
*  What we now have to do is get Hezbollah and get this done in the north. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  And so, of course, he later was fired for being so blunt about Gaza, but, and among [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  other things, the rivalry is there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  This does give Netanyahu some more freedom, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=390.52s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  And what's so interesting, it not only gives him more running room, it gives him some political [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  momentum if he chooses to use it, Bisa v Hamas and Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=398.76s)]
*  But what's so interesting here, Andrew, is that Bibi Netanyahu, essentially, to use Joe [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=403.4s)]
*  Biden's phrase, took a win. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=407.4s)]
*  He could have continued the war against Hezbollah, rejected the ceasefire, and he could have [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=409.56s)]
*  said, I want to continue prosecuting the war until Hezbollah is, quote unquote, destroyed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=414.96s)]
*  I would argue that's an impossibility. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=420.24s)]
*  But, but he chose essentially to settle for what? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=422.36s)]
*  Three quarters of a loaf or fifths of a loaf to accept that Hezbollah can continue to exist [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=426.28s)]
*  so long as it's north of the Latani River. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=431.24s)]
*  This is really, this is really interesting. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=434.28s)]
*  And again, the question is, will this be a precedent for a willingness on his part to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=436.64s)]
*  make a compromise vis-a-vis Gaza? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=441.48s)]
*  But some residue of Hamas will continue to exist. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=443.76s)]
*  The question is, will the Israelis be willing not just to accept the ceasefire, but start [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=447.88s)]
*  some type of a political process with the Palestinians that would allow an Arab stabilization [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  force to enter Gaza to provide security and stability, governance, and to allow rebuilding [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=459.52s)]
*  to start? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=465.4s)]
*  So to me, the biggest question is whether this compromise in the north to get a ceasefire, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=466.4s)]
*  whether Bibi Netanyahu just might be willing to replicate it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=472.64s)]
*  And he could then be a diplomatic partner of Donald Trump. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=478.0s)]
*  Who would have thought that there's again some really interesting opportunity and possibility [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=480.76s)]
*  for the first time in a long time. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Sw6B9AEdA&t=485.56s)]
