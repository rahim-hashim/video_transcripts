# 'No question' U.S. should be putting people on the ground in Syria: Adm. Stavridis
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4)
*  Joining us now, retired NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral James DeVides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=0.0s)]
*  Admiral, during the President-elect's press conference, he spoke out about Assad. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=4.68s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  I can say that Assad was a butcher. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=19.52s)]
*  What he did to children. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=21.96s)]
*  You remember I attacked him with the 58 missiles, unbelievable missiles coming from ships 700 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=23.8s)]
*  miles away and every one of them hit their target. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  But I did that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=36.68s)]
*  That was the red line in the sand. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=37.68s)]
*  The other big question for Americans, for the administration right now, is Deborah Tice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=42.32s)]
*  and what she said to Kristen Welker. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=49.44s)]
*  Austin Tice, believed to be alive by the administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=52.12s)]
*  Here's what, excuse me, while I clear my throat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=57.04s)]
*  Here's what she said to Kristen Welker about whether the US is doing enough. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=60.4s)]
*  We have incredible respect for the people that are going into the cells in the prisons. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=65.56s)]
*  That must be very challenging. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=72.32s)]
*  But we do have some feelings about what Richard saw and we're just so glad that he went in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=76.12s)]
*  there and we're so glad that he filmed it and it mattered to us hugely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=82.92s)]
*  Should the US government be there? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=95.12s)]
*  We'll take your silence as your answer there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=97.12s)]
*  I thought that was very telling as well when Kristen asked that question because the fact [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=101.92s)]
*  is that the French are now sending people in but as far as we are told, the administration [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  is talking to the rebels but doesn't have anyone on the ground. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=112.08s)]
*  Now I know how dangerous it is but what Deborah Tice was talking about is that Richard Engel [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=114.8s)]
*  and Deborah Tice confirmed the accuracy of this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=119.72s)]
*  Richard Engel went in and found through his sources someone who had been an eyewitness [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=123.28s)]
*  at least back in 2022 to Austin Tice in an adjacent cell and Richard got into that cell. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=130.76s)]
*  There is no question that at the earliest stage possible the US government should be [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=141.96s)]
*  putting people on the ground. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=148.08s)]
*  I am certain that conversation is happening. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  My hat is off to Richard Engel and other intrepid journalists who are doing exactly the same [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=153.84s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=160.08s)]
*  You see different stories about people going into these prisons and I suppose for the Tice [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=161.08s)]
*  family it must be heartbreaking not only to see those doors open and not see Austin's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=166.28s)]
*  face coming out but also wondering could my government be doing more. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  I know Tony Blinken, I know Lloyd Austin, I know Jake Sullivan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=179.56s)]
*  They are leaning forward and doing all they can. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=184.24s)]
*  Perhaps they don't want to show the US government faces on the ground there but in my heart [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=187.28s)]
*  I think they are engaged and I certainly hope that they are. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=194.56s)]
*  Let me also ask you about the whole question of what Israel is doing because Israel is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=199.8s)]
*  just hammering Syria. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=204.68s)]
*  Now they are talking about settlements in the Golan which is a disputed territory needing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=205.68s)]
*  a buffer. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=209.0s)]
*  Understandable they needed that with Lebanon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=211.2s)]
*  They weren't satisfied at all and it was proved correct in terms of the weapons that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=213.24s)]
*  were being buried on that supposedly DMZ. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=218.08s)]
*  They weren't satisfied with the UN forces there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=221.12s)]
*  But how do you see Israel's continued bombing attacks? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=224.24s)]
*  Taking out weapons depots but how complicated is that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=230.8s)]
*  Well first and foremost I think it's in US interest, in Israel's interest, in the interest [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=235.4s)]
*  of the West that WMD, weapons of mass destruction, are destroyed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=241.6s)]
*  And I think that is Israel's primary target. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=248.24s)]
*  They're also going after some of the conventional military capability of Syria and I think that's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=251.08s)]
*  also appropriate if you are a decision maker in Jerusalem. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=258.28s)]
*  From a US perspective we want no WMD, weapons of mass destruction, notably chemical weapons. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=263.28s)]
*  We don't want terrorism to reflash there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=271.12s)]
*  And number three we want our allies, Israel, Turkey to the north, that's a NATO border. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=275.12s)]
*  We want whatever level of stability we can achieve. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=280.96s)]
*  And number four any Americans that are caught in this crossfire like Mr. Tice, we want them [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  home. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=291.68s)]
*  So we've got some pretty clear objectives here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=292.68s)]
*  I hope the administration continues to support that approach in Syria because as you're showing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=295.0s)]
*  on that graphic it's a huge country in the Middle East. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a big population, 21 million. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=305.2s)]
*  There'll be more people coming back now that the regime has collapsed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of chaos there Andrea. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  We ought to worry about that and we ought to be doing all we can to rally the international [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  community to encourage these rebels to have a peaceful transition into control of Syria. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9tHWahbA4&t=320.92s)]
