# Taliban Allowing Nearly 200 Americans, Foreign Citizens To Leave Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c)
*  This is broken out of the Wall Street Journal where Taliban leaders will reportedly allow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=0.0s)]
*  close to 200 Americans and other foreign citizens to fly out of the country today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=4.24s)]
*  Officials tell the Wall Street Journal the group will be flown to Qatar before relocating [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=11.36s)]
*  elsewhere. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=16.1s)]
*  This will mark the first departure of U.S. citizens since the military mission in Afghanistan [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=17.78s)]
*  officially ended on August 31st. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=23.52s)]
*  It's unclear if these Americans are among those who were stranded on charter flights [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=26.64s)]
*  at Afghanistan's Masar-e-Sharif airport earlier this week. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=31.66s)]
*  Joe, again, a little bit more work on the Biden administration on the part of working [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=35.96s)]
*  to get people out of Afghanistan beyond the deadline. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=41.94s)]
*  And I think it's important to note, no matter what you think about the decision to leave, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=46.32s)]
*  that the president was warning people for quite some time, I believe since last April. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=54.32s)]
*  Yeah, since April. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=58.32s)]
*  And it was one warning after another warning after another warning after another warning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=60.08s)]
*  There was a story at NBC News about a guy who was a contractor, kept being warned to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=64.58s)]
*  leave and just his family tried to get him out of there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=71.92s)]
*  He said, I'll just stay here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=77.08s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=79.08s)]
*  Sort of a fix-it sort of guy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=82.08s)]
*  He's a hostage over there right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=84.28s)]
*  But there are Americans who, getting out now, Willie, but you look at these 200 Americans [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=86.08s)]
*  and let's hope that's up there a lot more. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=93.0s)]
*  You look at the 120,000 or so, the people we've already airlifted out of there, the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=95.42s)]
*  extraordinary, extraordinary bravery of our men and women in uniform and American officials [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=102.12s)]
*  and our allies that have allowed this to happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=109.5s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, the further we get away from the chaos of that first day, the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  more people are looking at sort of more of a global view of what's happened there and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=118.12s)]
*  said, wait a second, American troops and this country doing some pretty extraordinary things [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=124.84s)]
*  there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=131.56s)]
*  So, Matthew Van Dyke, he's the founder of Sons of Liberty International. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=132.56s)]
*  He's a veteran, talks about when he was a prisoner in Syria. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=139.28s)]
*  He actually tweeted this a day or two ago. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=145.56s)]
*  I initially criticized Biden for Afghanistan, comparing it to the fall of Saigon. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=148.84s)]
*  Matthew writes, he proved me wrong. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  The past few weeks rescuing 120,000 in Kabul was incredible and historic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=155.78s)]
*  The use of carrot and stick diplomacy on Taliban was brilliant. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=160.58s)]
*  The military achievements, extraordinary. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=164.4s)]
*  This story is still being written. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=167.56s)]
*  We don't know how it's going to end up right now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  But the people who have been whooping it up on Twitter, and again, I've been very critical [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=174.32s)]
*  of us leaving Afghanistan, but the people who have been whooping it up on Twitter saying [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=179.8s)]
*  that this is the worst thing that's ever happened and drawing parallels with Saigon have missed [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=184.66s)]
*  the mark. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=191.22s)]
*  The numbers aren't even close. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=192.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously there are the 13 American service members who were killed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=193.22s)]
*  A lot of people think these evacuations could have started much sooner to avoid the chaos [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=196.24s)]
*  that led to the death of those service members. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=200.16s)]
*  What's interesting about this number from the journal this morning, the 200 numbers, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=202.28s)]
*  we've been told there are about 100 to 200 Americans left in the country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=206.24s)]
*  So where does that leave us if there are not 200 American passport holders? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=210.66s)]
*  I think this includes some foreigners also who have passports to get out of the country, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  so I don't think it's all Americans. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  But this would represent, if you believe that number, a large chunk of the Americans remaining [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  in the country who want to leave the country and show, at least in this case, that the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=224.58s)]
*  Taliban, who the American government has been forced into a relationship now with, to trust [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  them to help get these people out, at least in this one case, is upholding its end of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=234.46s)]
*  the bargain, just here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  And you've got to look at Qatar and what they've been doing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  I think we're going to be talking to the foreign ministry this week or next week about what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=243.34s)]
*  Qatar's doing, being a go-between between the United States and also the Taliban. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=247.78s)]
*  But Eddie, there is the great tragedy, as Willie said, of 13 American servicemen and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=253.78s)]
*  women who died there, just true heroes, who understood, understood because the warnings [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=259.98s)]
*  were going. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=265.66s)]
*  We were hearing the warnings about ISIS coming in, and they knew that, man, they were in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=266.66s)]
*  danger and they were still talking about how they loved their job. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=274.3s)]
*  They were still risking their lives, and it's just so tragic. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=280.36s)]
*  And yet, what they have done, along with our other military men and women and other officials, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=288.8s)]
*  again, freed 120,000, 130,000 people, saved tens of thousands of lives, one of the greatest [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=296.0s)]
*  humanitarian missions that we've done. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=303.8s)]
*  And I think we can all concede that, no matter your position with regards to Afghanistan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=307.2s)]
*  We should be able to see that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=311.12s)]
*  And yet, a lot of people who are on Twitter and have op-ed pieces are still looking back [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  to the first day and ignoring everything our men and women in uniform have done since then. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=321.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=326.24s)]
*  It seems like we're in a moment where everybody's trying to make political hay of everything, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=327.24s)]
*  trying to find their position. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=330.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=331.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=332.0s)]
*  No matter what it is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=333.0s)]
*  But we can concede this claim. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=334.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=401.8s)]
*  Yeah, and look, Joe, I think the thing with you and the thing that we all, you know, at [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=402.8s)]
*  various times took our eye off the ball on, one thing that the administration never took [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=407.8s)]
*  its eye off the ball on, which was the large question on the macro existential, the fundamental [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=412.6s)]
*  choice, is this war over or not? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=421.52s)]
*  Are we going to get out? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  Are we going to accept the fact that we lost this war and end it now? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=426.04s)]
*  The administration was always with the vast majority of the American public on that, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=431.0s)]
*  which is where Donald Trump was, as you just said a second ago. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=434.8s)]
*  And there is a totally respectable position that says we should have tried to make this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=437.48s)]
*  into North Korea, to North and South Korea, to make it into Germany, make it into, you [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=440.96s)]
*  know, have a small set of troops there to try to stabilize the region, et cetera, et [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=445.56s)]
*  cetera. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=450.4s)]
*  Respectable point of view. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=451.4s)]
*  I know it's your point of view, but it's not where the American people are. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=452.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=454.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=455.44s)]
*  And so in the end, we were always going to come back to that, that something like 70, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=456.44s)]
*  75% of the American people wanted to end this war, wanted to end it now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=460.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think the administration had that long view throughout. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=464.48s)]
*  Now I do think there are two large questions that carry forward from there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  One of them is the question that Eddie just raised, which I do think there will be questions [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  about going on for a very long time, not how the evacuation was run, because that, I agree [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=475.42s)]
*  with you, and I think history again will say this was an incredibly successful operation [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=481.12s)]
*  to get all the Americans, almost all the Americans out safely. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, we know about the ones who died in that car bomb, and there are still some left [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=491.08s)]
*  behind, but the vast majority of Americans are out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=494.0s)]
*  But there is this large question of what about the Afghan allies? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=496.8s)]
*  What about the people, the moral obligation that America had to those people who fought [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=500.36s)]
*  alongside Americans and tried to help Americans for the last 20 years? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=504.0s)]
*  What happens to them? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=507.58s)]
*  I think people will raise questions about that for a long time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=508.66s)]
*  And then the other long-term question that goes to your point, which is, does Afghanistan [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=511.5s)]
*  now become a renewed center for terrorist activity that threatens America? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=516.28s)]
*  It has not been for the last 20 years, and will it become that again? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=521.48s)]
*  And if it becomes that again, there will again be long-term questions raised about whether [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=524.76s)]
*  we should have kept some kind of a small force there in order to keep that from happening. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  But those are questions for another day. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you are so right, and it's something that I have acknowledged. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=534.88s)]
*  I understand that by wanting to keep people in Afghanistan, keeping American troops in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=538.52s)]
*  with Syria, that I'm in the minority. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=543.92s)]
*  I know 75% of Americans agree with what Joe Biden has done here in getting Americans out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  And I do understand the logic of, hey, you're either in or you're out. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  And if you keep a small residual force there, then what you're doing is you're just prolonging [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=557.3s)]
*  a presence there. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=563.8s)]
*  And again, 75% of Americans wanted our troops out. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=564.8s)]
*  I will say, I just want to be clear with everybody, I'm not interested in keeping American troops [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=569.8s)]
*  in places like Afghanistan to rebuild countries. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=575.92s)]
*  We've learned over the past 20 years that doesn't work. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=578.72s)]
*  I want American troops there to intimidate and kill bad people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=580.92s)]
*  And I want us to be able to strike out, whether it's in Syria and going after ISIS like we [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=585.36s)]
*  did or whether it's in Afghanistan, going after ISIS. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=596.6s)]
*  Again, I'm in the minority here. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=597.64s)]
*  And I certainly, boy, I respect people who say enough is enough is enough. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=600.0400000000001s)]
*  But Willie, I think we've confirmed it now. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=606.24s)]
*  Yeah, NBC News has confirmed this report. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  Raf Sanchez, who's in Doha, Qatar, tells us, two sources familiar with the matter confirm [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  a Qatari flight will take 200 people, Americans and other nationalities, to leave from Kabul [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  to Doha today. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZ7AZjqn5c&t=623.8000000000001s)]
