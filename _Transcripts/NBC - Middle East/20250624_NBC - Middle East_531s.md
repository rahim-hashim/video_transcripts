# ‘The president lied’: Top Intel Dem on U.S. strike claims
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g)
*  Joaquin Castro of Texas, he is a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=0.0s)]
*  Committees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=4.08s)]
*  Welcome, Congressman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=5.08s)]
*  It's a pleasure having you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=6.08s)]
*  So let's just unpack this assessment a little bit more, because there are a couple of story [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=7.36s)]
*  lines that are emerging here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=12.68s)]
*  But for you, as a member of Congress, sitting in a position on the Intelligence Committee [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=14.16s)]
*  to look at this information, how much will you be able to trust coming out of this administration [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=20.12s)]
*  when you finally, if ever, get that briefing that sort of lays out exactly what happened? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=26.88s)]
*  Because we have quotes here from one of the three sources saying, we were assuming that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=33.76s)]
*  the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  So clearly, there is some distance between where the White House is on this and what [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=45.36s)]
*  the Intelligence Community is looking at post the bombing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  What do you anticipate? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=55.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, first, let's consider the context and how we got here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=56.74s)]
*  We had an agreement with Iran to contain their nuclear weapons program. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=62.82000000000001s)]
*  That agreement was put in place during President Obama's presidency. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=68.7s)]
*  And when Donald Trump became president, he took us out of that agreement. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=72.7s)]
*  And so at that point, it became harder to know how quickly they were enriching uranium [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=76.72s)]
*  and how close they were to developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=83.14s)]
*  That said, all of the intelligence that I saw beforehand, the military, diplomatic, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=86.74s)]
*  and intelligence assessments, didn't suggest that there was an imminent threat that Iran [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=91.78s)]
*  had a functional, deliverable nuclear weapon. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=97.1s)]
*  Because it's not just about enriching uranium. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=100.3s)]
*  There are several other steps that a country has to take to have that functional nuclear [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=102.62s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=107.78s)]
*  So what we have now, after the United States got involved in the war, dropped all those [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=108.9s)]
*  bombs on the nuclear facilities, is we had Donald Trump essentially exaggerating and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=114.22s)]
*  overstating, which is not unusual for him, but exaggerating the damage that was done. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=120.22s)]
*  And I can't comment, because I'm on the Intelligence Committee, about a particular assessment. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=127.5s)]
*  But it's my belief, after looking at everything, that the president lied about the amount of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=132.58s)]
*  damage that was done. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=138.22s)]
*  And so the danger now is, if in fact they still have the ability to develop a nuclear [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=139.82s)]
*  weapon within months, for example, then we could be in this situation again, where Israel [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=146.78s)]
*  strikes at Iran again and tries to get the United States to go along. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=153.66s)]
*  That could be a few months. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=159.0s)]
*  It could be within a year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=160.0s)]
*  But it would essentially mean that we're caught in this endless loop of a warring Iran and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=162.42s)]
*  Israel and the United States being asked to get involved. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=168.62s)]
*  Not asking you to comment on the contents of the assessment, but the classified assessment [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  in question, sir. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=177.88s)]
*  We now have Senate Democrats who have told NBC News that they have seen the document [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=179.84s)]
*  who are on the relevant committees. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=184.18s)]
*  Have you seen this document in question? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=186.5s)]
*  I've seen an assessment of what happened. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=189.78s)]
*  I'll just say that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=194.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  You want to pick up, Simone? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  Do you have a follow-up there? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure you have many. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, I guess my only follow-up is, you know, you note that the president has a tendency [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  to exaggerate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  And I would agree with you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  I think folks at home, the question they might ask is, and why is that a problem? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=208.14s)]
*  Because if a lot of people are making this out to be that, oh, well, you know, this is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=213.62s)]
*  just how the president does business. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=218.26s)]
*  But I think you've hit a nail on the head here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  Why is his exaggeration an issue, particularly when it comes to intelligence, military strikes, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=223.0s)]
*  actions that the United States has taken? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, first, he didn't go to Congress for any kind of authorization. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=233.06s)]
*  And so he did this unilaterally. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  He overstepped his bounds. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=240.68s)]
*  But remember, when we talk about a president lying about something or exaggerating, this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=242.5s)]
*  is not a matter of crowd size at an inauguration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=246.98s)]
*  This is a matter of war and potentially risking or not potentially actually risking American [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  service members' lives in that war and risking getting us more deeply involved as well. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=257.74s)]
*  Over the past week and especially over the weekend as all this was taking place, I had [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=265.98s)]
*  so many people in San Antonio, Texas, where I represent, that's known as Military City [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=269.76s)]
*  who reached out to me and said, we don't want to get involved in another long and messy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=275.54s)]
*  and very expensive war in the Middle East. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=279.42s)]
*  And so they saw us going down that same road that we went down with Iraq where, based on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=282.94s)]
*  biased or bad intelligence, a president makes a decision and essentially makes a mistake [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=288.1s)]
*  that could cost thousands of lives of American service members. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=293.94s)]
*  Congressman, you had the president complaining about both Israel and Iran saying they don't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=297.66s)]
*  know what the F they're doing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  Is that a policy shift or a mood shift on the part of the president? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=303.44s)]
*  I mean, I think that he's upset that I think, you know, this is me trying to piece together [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=306.84s)]
*  what happened, but I think that he was trying to cajole them into a ceasefire and they didn't [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=313.02s)]
*  do that immediately. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=318.08s)]
*  And he doesn't like it that people don't listen to him right away. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=319.76s)]
*  And so he got upset on the White House lawn. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=322.88s)]
*  But based on everything I'm seeing, I'm telling you, I don't I would be surprised if this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=325.76s)]
*  ceasefire holds. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=330.12s)]
*  And I want to be clear. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=331.64s)]
*  I hope that it does. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=332.64s)]
*  I hope that it holds. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=333.68s)]
*  I don't want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, but I believe that the best way to do that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=335.36s)]
*  and the proven way to do that is by coming to some kind of agreement with them that restricts [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=340.32s)]
*  their nuclear arms program. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=346.08s)]
*  Otherwise, I do think that we're going to be in this situation again. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=348.32s)]
*  But Congressman, let's break this down a little bit more. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=352.24s)]
*  There is a reason why Iran has been, in my estimation, a little bit cavalier about all [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=356.8s)]
*  of this in the sense that there's not been this heightened kind of like, you know, reaction [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=362.72s)]
*  in a sort of a tepid response. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=371.2s)]
*  You know, OK, we're going to give you a heads up. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=373.48s)]
*  We're going to drop a few bombs on a couple of bases and call it a night because they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=375.12s)]
*  know what damage was and was not done to their facilities. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=379.36s)]
*  They know that what Donald Trump did only took them out of the game for about three [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=384.24s)]
*  to six months at worst. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=389.08s)]
*  So when you see in here individuals like press secretary, press secretary Carolyn Leavitt, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=391.88s)]
*  you know, screening against CNN and MSNBC and others who are reporting on this assessment [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=398.52s)]
*  with, you know, quote, this alleged assessment is flat out wrong and was classified as top [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=405.04s)]
*  but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous low-level loser in the intelligence community. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=410.64s)]
*  Caroline, it could have been a rather high-lover poser. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=415.68s)]
*  I mean, you don't know where it came from. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=419.64s)]
*  So you know, this sort of name-calling reaction by the administration tells me at least they [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=421.88s)]
*  got stuck and stung on this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=427.84s)]
*  So from your position on the Intelligence Committee, and I took to heart the way you [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=430.64s)]
*  answered Simone's question, there's a little bit more there in terms of what's being reported [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=435.28s)]
*  about this assessment that sticks rather than not sticks. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=442.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, look, you could be right that Iran, after they did the damage assessment [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  on their own, decided that it was not a fatal blow to their program. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  And so there was no need for them to get into a really all-out war with the United States [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=456.76s)]
*  or with Israel and made that assessment. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=464.36s)]
*  That is quite possible. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=467.04s)]
*  But again, it speaks to the fact that you could have this continuing cycle of Israel [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  and Iran going at each other and fighting and Israel asking the United States to get [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=474.56s)]
*  involved. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=479.72s)]
*  And remember, the reason I say that is because Israel, they didn't have the weapons necessary, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=480.72s)]
*  the bombers and the bombs necessary to take out these facilities on their own. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  So when Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, made a decision to hit those facilities, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=492.36s)]
*  he knew that the only way he could finish the job possibly was by getting the United [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=497.52s)]
*  States involved in a war. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=502.48s)]
*  And that's going to be the case a month from now, two months from now or a year from now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=504.92s)]
*  And we'll be back at it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4wtNiwJ1g&t=509.48s)]
