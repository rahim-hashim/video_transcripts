# What’s happens next? Iran still has tech to ‘reconstitute’ their nuclear program: Writer
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU)
*  Welcome back. Iran's supreme leader reemerged this morning on Iranian state TV, releasing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=0.0s)]
*  a video message and a post on social media after weeks spent in hiding and in radio silence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=6.48s)]
*  Ayatollah claiming victory over Israel and saying President Trump's claims that their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=12.68s)]
*  nuclear program has been obliterated are exaggerated. This, as President Trump is signaling talks [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=17.34s)]
*  between the U.S. and Iranian officials, will take place next week, but also saying a nuclear [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=24.04s)]
*  deal is not, quote, necessary in the aftermath of American air strikes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=29.2s)]
*  We're going to talk to them next week with Iran. We may sign an agreement. I don't know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=35.6s)]
*  To me, I don't think it's that necessary. I mean, they had a war, they fought. Now they're [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=42.36s)]
*  going back to their world. I don't care if I have an agreement or not. We the only thing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=46.3s)]
*  we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about we want no nuclear, but we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=50.8s)]
*  destroyed the nuclear. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=56.36s)]
*  I want to bring in Umman Majid. He's an Iranian-American writer and MSNBC contributor. Umman, thank [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=57.4s)]
*  you so much for being in. We hadn't heard from the Ayatollah for days, especially during [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=64.4s)]
*  the American strikes against Iran. It's clear this is what he said today when he came up. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=70.08s)]
*  He said the Americans failed to achieve anything significant in their attack on nuclear facilities. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=75.68s)]
*  It's clear that the American president needs to exaggerate. They resort to exaggeration [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=80.0s)]
*  to cover up the truth. What's your reaction to the tone and how the Ayatollah is positioning [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=85.04s)]
*  Iran here? What do you think the Iranian people hear there? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=91.62s)]
*  Well, I think the Iranian people listen to the Ayatollah's words, but they also watch [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=94.18s)]
*  the BBC and Voice of America and various channels, CNN, of course, and they know what's going [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=99.16s)]
*  on. Better than most people think the Iranian people know. But of course, the message is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=106.16s)]
*  to the diehard supporters of the Islamic Republic that the U.S. didn't do what they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=111.22s)]
*  said they did. Israel didn't do what it said it did. That's a message that I think a lot [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=117.22s)]
*  of Iranians will actually accept, that it's exaggeration. People can understand. It's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=123.46s)]
*  in the interest of the United States to say it's done, especially with an administration [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=128.22s)]
*  like Donald Trump's. It's in the interest of the Israelis to say they were victorious [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=132.14s)]
*  and they were able to completely obliterate Iranians, both nuclear infrastructure and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=136.36s)]
*  their missiles and the ability to strike back. And it's in the interest of the Iranians [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=141.02s)]
*  to say they didn't. Of course, that's the rhetoric. The problem here is that what's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=145.3s)]
*  next? I mean, Donald Trump says we're going to talk to Iran next, but maybe we don't need [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  to because we did away with their nuclear program. But we didn't do away with their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=154.34s)]
*  nuclear program. Even if you accept that the program has been obliterated, the functioning [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  program has been obliterated, Iran has the technology to reconstitute it. So what happens [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=164.9s)]
*  next? Does Iran reconstitute it? And if it does, what will we do? Do we go back to war? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  Does Israel strike again? I mean, the problem here is war is not going to solve the nuclear [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  issue. Diplomacy was supposed to solve it. Diplomacy had two... There were two things [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=181.98s)]
*  with diplomacy. One was to guarantee that Iran's program was peaceful, somehow create [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=186.78s)]
*  a mechanism so that the program was peaceful. Inspections, limits on the stockpile of enriched [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=191.7s)]
*  uranium. The second one, the second goal was to incentivize Iran to never go to a program. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  Now both of those have been demolished. We don't have inspectors right now properly inspecting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=205.38s)]
*  it. Yeah, the IAEA has said they've been trying to communicate and asking it in and they're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  not getting an answer. Right. And Iran's not going to give them any answer right away because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=215.22s)]
*  they feel that if they give them the answer, oh, here's where the stockpile is, then it'll [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=219.1s)]
*  get bombed or it'll get destroyed, right? So that's going to be a while before the IAEA [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  even gets in. So that's been destroyed. Diplomacy has been destroyed because Iran doesn't trust [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=227.78s)]
*  it anymore. I mean, think about it. Iran was scheduled two days after Israel attacked, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  scheduled to have their sixth meeting with the Trump administration on diplomatic solution [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=239.06s)]
*  to the nuclear crisis. And Israel attacked with the sort of yellow light or green light [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=244.66s)]
*  by Donald Trump. And then Trump attacked. Right. And we do know that there was significant [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=251.3s)]
*  destruction in general across the country, of course, across different infrastructure [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=256.66s)]
*  impacts the military. Yes, no question. It impacts to the nuclear facilities. I'm wondering [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=262.54s)]
*  how you see it in terms of like what's happening in Iran right now. We've heard the president [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=267.94s)]
*  and others talking about regime change, but what did change based on what we know? What [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=272.82000000000005s)]
*  is different right now inside Iran because of all of these attacks? Well, what's different [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  is definitely that Iranians have witnessed their military being overwhelmed by Israel [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=283.62s)]
*  first and then by the United States. And I think what's changed is intelligence. For [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=290.66s)]
*  example, Iran has a huge intelligence failure in allowing Israel to basically operate with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  agents on the ground in Iran and be able to pinpoint who they want to assassinate. And [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=301.9s)]
*  that's a shock to the Iranian people and a shock to the system. So that's going to be [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=307.02s)]
*  of the first things Iran's going to want to correct. They're already going after what [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=310.94s)]
*  people they call Mossad agents. And some may have been and some may not have been. But [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=315.46s)]
*  there's going to be a roundup of a lot of people in this intelligence failure, perhaps [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=320.26s)]
*  even within the military. There's no question that Mossad has been able to infiltrate the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  military and pinpoint where people are sleeping in their beds and kill them with missiles. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=329.06s)]
*  So that's something the Iranians are somewhat shocked by, not just the government, but [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=335.66s)]
*  the people too. And the people who've been bombarded by missiles and by Israeli bombs, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=340.94s)]
*  I'm not talking about the US bombardment of specific nuclear sites. Well, they tried to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=347.18s)]
*  leave Tehran. Now they're coming back. They're going to try to rebuild the city. They're [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=351.88s)]
*  going to, you know, cafes will start opening up. They already are actually opening up. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  Masses will open up. You know, Friday is tomorrow's a holiday in the Muslim world. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=360.86s)]
*  But Saturday will be the first day of the week since this war ended, since the ceasefire. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=366.66s)]
*  And we'll start seeing things change in Iran slowly. But there's a lot of shock among the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=372.26s)]
*  people, including the fact that over 400 people died. Civilians have died in this. Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=376.62s)]
*  Well, Humann, Manjid, I would love to have a deeper conversation that we like barely [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=383.62s)]
*  scratched the surface, I feel like, but you are a wealth of information. Thank you so [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=388.42s)]
*  much for sharing some of it with us. It's my pleasure. Great to have you with us. Thank [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkUM5DuMsU&t=394.78s)]
