# Trump says U.S. 'will take over the Gaza Strip’ in joint press conference with Netanyahu
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg)
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=13.44s)]
*  Level it out. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=17.48s)]
*  Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=18.48s)]
*  the people of the area. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Do a real job. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=26.2s)]
*  Do something different. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=28.12s)]
*  This can't go back. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=29.42s)]
*  If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=30.42s)]
*  I'm hopeful that this ceasefire could be the beginning of a larger and more enduring [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=34.74s)]
*  peace that will end the bloodshed and killing once and for all. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  With the same goal in mind, my administration has been moving quickly to restore trust in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=43.6s)]
*  the alliance and rebuild American strength throughout the region. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  And we've really done that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=52.42s)]
*  We're a respected nation again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=53.58s)]
*  A lot's happened in the last couple of weeks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=55.5s)]
*  We are actually a very respected nation again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=58.06s)]
*  I ended the last administration's de facto arms embargo on over $1 billion in military [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=62.5s)]
*  assistance for Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=68.86s)]
*  And I'm also pleased to announce that this afternoon, the United States withdrew from [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=71.14s)]
*  the anti-Semitic UN Human Rights Council and ended all of the support for the UN Relief [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=75.1s)]
*  and Works Agency, which funneled money to Hamas and which was very disloyal to humanity. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=80.78s)]
*  Today, I also took action to restore a maximum pressure policy on the Iranian regime. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=87.5s)]
*  And we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=93.41999999999999s)]
*  to zero, and diminish the regime's capacity to fund terror throughout the region and throughout [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  We had no threat when I left office. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=106.74s)]
*  Iran was not able to sell oil. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=110.13999999999999s)]
*  Nobody was buying oil because I said, don't buy it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=115.54s)]
*  If you buy it, you're not doing any business with the United States. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=118.18s)]
*  And Hamas was not being funded. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=121.18s)]
*  Hezbollah was not being funded. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=122.78s)]
*  Nobody was being funded. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=125.18s)]
*  That would never have been on October 7th. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=126.78s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I once again designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=129.66s)]
*  They're trying to destroy world shipping lanes, and that's not going to happen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=135.34s)]
*  And over the weekend, I ordered airstrikes against senior ISIS leaders, ISIS leaders [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=141.02s)]
*  hiding in Somalia and took them out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=144.9s)]
*  Here in America, we've begun the process of deporting foreign terrorists, jihadists, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=148.94000000000003s)]
*  and Hamas sympathizers from our soil, just as we have people that are extremely evil. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=153.3s)]
*  And we're sending them out of our country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  They came from jails. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=162.62s)]
*  They came from mental institutions and insane asylums, and they were dumped into our country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=164.34s)]
*  They're gang members. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=168.9s)]
*  And I'm getting them out at numbers that nobody can actually believe. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=170.66s)]
*  And every single country is taking those people back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  They said they would never take them back, and they're all taking them back, and they're [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=178.94s)]
*  taking them back very gladly. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=182.26s)]
*  And I recently signed an executive order combating the vile wave of anti-Semitism that we've [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=184.82s)]
*  seen in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  Together America and Israel will renew the optimism that shined so brightly just four [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=195.18s)]
*  years ago. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  It was really a bright, beautiful light. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=203.82s)]
*  and hope to our nations and for all people of the Middle East, including the Arab and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=208.42s)]
*  Muslim nations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=213.98s)]
*  Very important. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=214.98s)]
*  We want the Arab and Muslim nations to have peace and have tranquility and have great [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=215.98s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qIK2Y5W8Fg&t=223.38s)]
