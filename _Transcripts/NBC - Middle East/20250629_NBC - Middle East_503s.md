# Rep Subramanyam: Iran intel briefing ‘did not satisfy’ questions over extent of destruction
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI)
*  President Trump continues to stand by his claim that the United States' strikes completely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=0.0s)]
*  quote obliterated, his word, Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=7.8s)]
*  Though there's been widespread dispute over that claim. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  This week, the CIA assessed that the nuclear program was quote severely damaged, which [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  doesn't back up Trump's narrative of complete obliteration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=21.0s)]
*  And then there's still the big question of what happened to Iran's stockpile of enriched [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=24.82s)]
*  uranium. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=30.08s)]
*  Now, here's what Trump had to say about that in a Fox News interview airing today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=31.08s)]
*  Do you think that the Iran regime hid some of the enriched uranium before the strikes? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=36.66s)]
*  No. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=45.46s)]
*  I saw reports that there were 400 kilograms, 800 pounds that they moved, but I wonder if [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=46.46s)]
*  it's traceable. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=52.78s)]
*  I mean, if they were to have moved. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=53.78s)]
*  They didn't move anything. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=55.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill say they've also been left with more [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=57.38s)]
*  questions than answers after receiving classified intelligence briefings on Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=61.86s)]
*  Our next guest was in the House briefing on Friday, and that is Congressman Suhasu Brahmaniam [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  of Virginia, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=72.26s)]
*  Congressman, welcome to the weekend. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  So obviously, the first question is your reaction to that clip of the president dismissing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=78.9s)]
*  the assertion that Iran hid its enriched uranium before the U.S. strikes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=85.7s)]
*  Yeah, I still haven't heard anything about that uranium and where it is or what happened [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=90.86000000000001s)]
*  to it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=95.7s)]
*  All it took is 10 trucks to be able to move that, and they'd been talking about strikes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=96.7s)]
*  on that area for the whole weekend. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=101.34s)]
*  It probably got moved, but we really don't know. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=104.5s)]
*  The fact that the president is so confidently saying that everything is OK is a red flag [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=109.26s)]
*  because this president loves to stretch truth. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=114.98s)]
*  What's interesting about that whole operation was the biggest risk to the operation was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=118.74s)]
*  the president himself tweeting. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=124.9s)]
*  And so that's where we are right now with our national security apparatus. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=127.46s)]
*  We have people who are texting war plans on signal, intelligence people who are getting [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=131.9s)]
*  conflicted advice from the president and the president being the biggest threat to operations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  these days. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=144.1s)]
*  And I've come away from briefings with far more questions than I had going in, and they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=145.1s)]
*  were not very helpful to say the least. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=150.46s)]
*  Well, Congressman, that's what I want to dive into, that briefing and intelligence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  What were you told that you can disclose to us? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=157.86s)]
*  And did it satisfy your need for knowledge about the extent of the destruction of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=161.02s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=167.66s)]
*  It did not satisfy me when it comes to the extent of the destruction, because it just [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=170.5s)]
*  seems like there's a lot of questions about how much destruction actually happened. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=177.1s)]
*  And this administration just wants to tell people it's obliterated and hope they move [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=183.22s)]
*  on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=187.1s)]
*  The reality is though, Iran, it's unclear how fast they can make a nuclear weapon at [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=188.1s)]
*  this point. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=195.9s)]
*  I think what is clear though is that this administration did not consult Congress. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=196.94s)]
*  It looks like they're going to try to consult Congress and the American people even less [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=201.94s)]
*  so moving forward. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  It looks like this president is still willing to continue strikes on Iran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=208.58s)]
*  And from all of that, I just feel like this needs to be something where Congress and the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=213.34s)]
*  administration and the American people deserve a say before we are thrust into another forever [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=219.3s)]
*  war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=223.82s)]
*  Congressman, you just mentioned the president alluding to possibly striking Iran again. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  He said that on Friday in front of some reporters. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=229.78s)]
*  I want to play that sound for you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=232.1s)]
*  If the intelligence reports conclude that Iran can enrich uranium to a level that concerns [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=235.5s)]
*  you, would you consider bombing the country again? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=241.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=244.5s)]
*  Without question, absolutely. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=245.5s)]
*  What are you—what's your reaction to that, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=249.5s)]
*  This is the president of the United States saying that he would probably, without asking [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=252.86s)]
*  and talking to Congress beforehand, bomb a sovereign country again, even though he already [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=256.9s)]
*  said that everything was obliterated. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=262.02s)]
*  So I guess square that circle for me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=263.66s)]
*  A lot of that's not making sense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=265.46s)]
*  Your reaction to what he said? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not making a lot of sense to me either. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=269.26s)]
*  I'll tell you this though. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=271.02s)]
*  The justification for not coming to Congress before those bombings was that they were targeted [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=272.94s)]
*  and they were a one-time narrow mission. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=278.14s)]
*  And so what he's saying contradicts the whole reasoning why they didn't need to consult [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=281.82s)]
*  Congress. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  And I suspect that he wouldn't come to Congress again for future attacks on Iran or any other [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=293.5s)]
*  This was a president that promised—there was a campaign promise that he wouldn't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=294.5s)]
*  start new wars, that there would be world peace the day he got sworn in, that he'd [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  put an end to all conflicts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  And here we are right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  So this is a mistake that's been made many, many times in American foreign policy, and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=306.98s)]
*  I hope we don't make it again, but I will continue to speak out and so will others. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=312.06s)]
*  So Congressman, one of the ways that we can solve this issue with Iran is if, oh, let's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=316.3s)]
*  say a deal is concluded to put all of this aside. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=322.7s)]
*  On Friday, NBC News had this story with the headline Trump administration exploring a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  $30 billion civilian nuclear deal for Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=333.5s)]
*  And here's a poll quote. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=337.38s)]
*  The Trump administration in recent days has explored possible economic incentives for [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=338.38s)]
*  Iran in return for the regime halting uranium enrichment, including releasing billions of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=342.34s)]
*  dollars in frozen Iranian assets, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=347.86s)]
*  In reading that, Congressman, just as a side note, that reminds me a lot of the Iran nuclear [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=353.3s)]
*  deal that President Obama negotiated during his second term. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=358.74s)]
*  But here is the reaction from the president, from President Trump, about that story. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=363.9s)]
*  This is what he put on his social media platform in response to that story. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=370.06s)]
*  Who in the fake news media is the sleazebag saying that President Trump wants to give [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=374.78s)]
*  Iran $30 billion to build non-military nuclear facilities? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  Never heard of this ridiculous idea. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  It's just another hoax put out by the fake news in order to demean demean. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=384.14s)]
*  These people are sick. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=390.06s)]
*  All caps. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  Sorry, America, I read that to you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  But I wanted to read it, Congressman, because it sort of reminds me of the whole conversation [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=394.34s)]
*  we were having at the beginning of the show about the president's tariffs policy, just [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=399.3s)]
*  throwing numbers out there, throwing deadlines out there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  None of it means anything. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=407.38s)]
*  What do you make of the story and the president's reaction? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=410.26s)]
*  Have you seen any hints or elements of a new deal with Iran that would maybe solve this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=414.1s)]
*  question of its enriched uranium program? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=422.22s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this was a president that his first campaign came to office promising [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=424.54s)]
*  to erect the Iran deal, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=430.26000000000005s)]
*  And so they had a deal in place. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  I was in the Obama White House at the time. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=434.18s)]
*  They had a deal in place, and then he came in and took us out of it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=436.66s)]
*  And now, eight years later, he's realizing why we did it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=441.34s)]
*  And so he's trying to do it himself only worse. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  And this is a president that contradicts himself all the time because when he faces pressure, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=447.06s)]
*  he starts to lie, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=452.02s)]
*  And so I think once you want to one thing I've understood about this president is when [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  he's feeling the heat or when he hears someone counter a policy of his, he'll just start [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=456.78s)]
*  to lie about the policy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=463.26s)]
*  We're talking, you know, the recent reconciliation bill. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  And now he's saying that doesn't cut Medicaid, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=468.42s)]
*  It doesn't increase the deficit and debt. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=470.3s)]
*  And so once you understand that about the president, we start to square the circle as [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=472.42s)]
*  he's not a truthful president. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=477.34s)]
*  Congressman Subramanian, thank you so much for coming on the weekend. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyzJNecnsI&t=480.02s)]
