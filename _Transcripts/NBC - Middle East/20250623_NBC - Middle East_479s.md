# An isolated Iran looks for allies on the world stage
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914)
*  A stunned and battered Iran is turning to its closest allies as it weighs how to respond [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=0.0s)]
*  to the U.S. attack. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=5.84s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister has arrived in Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and other senior [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=7.68s)]
*  Russia officials. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=12.16s)]
*  There's a deep partnership between the two countries that has grown in recent years, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=13.92s)]
*  especially after Iran supplied Moscow with drones and missiles in its war against Ukraine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=18.2s)]
*  And then there's North Korea and China. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=24.2s)]
*  Iran and North Korea reportedly share missile technology and nuclear research, and China [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=26.24s)]
*  maintains strong diplomatic and economic relations with both countries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=31.459999999999997s)]
*  Joining us now to break it all down is former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=36.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Just give us the take of the Russian leadership as the strikes against Iran are happening [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=45.06s)]
*  and the United States is being drawn into this war. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=53.4s)]
*  Well, the Russian government and many different officials have criticized the strikes, as [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=56.8s)]
*  have many countries around the world, by the way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  There are very few that have supported us besides Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=66.06s)]
*  Second, this is a blow to the ally, Russia's ally, as you just rightly pointed out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Iran has been very central. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=76.16s)]
*  There are drones every day being used against Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=77.52s)]
*  This is an ally, and I think more broadly speaking, Russia's role, Russia's Putin's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=82.4s)]
*  policy, I want to be clear about that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Putin's policy in the Middle East has suffered yet another blow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=90.12s)]
*  He lost Assad, Hamas and Hezbollah are weakened. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Now Iran is weakened. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  So the short term, this is very bad for Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  But in the longer term, I think this is actually good for Russia in two ways. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  One, we're now legitimating preemptive war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what Putin says he did against Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=110.16s)]
*  And now that we've joined that, this is now, well, this is just how great powers act. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  I think that's bad for America's long-term interests. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=117.56s)]
*  And moreover, you mentioned North Korea, you mentioned China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  We are now isolating ourselves at a time when China looks like the country that's the responsible [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  stakeholder in favor of sovereignty, in favor of international law. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=132.56s)]
*  That I think hurts America's long-term interests as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=138.08s)]
*  How do you think our allies are looking at us tonight? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=142.84s)]
*  Obviously, there's unease here and abroad. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=146.68s)]
*  But are they shocked? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  How is this going to impact America's relationship with our allies going forward? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=154.46s)]
*  Are they buying this administration's story, or at least initial story, since Trump's own [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  messaging tonight seems to be signaling at regime change. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=164.4s)]
*  But at least it was this sort of central tactical strike that was going to be decisive and were [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  not planning to really enter a war here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  Many see it very differently now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=178.96s)]
*  But how are our allies interpreting all of this, and how do you think it's going to impact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  their decision-making? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=184.96s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you brought that question up, because there's been a lot of conversation [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=187.96s)]
*  over the last 24 hours that this is nothing new. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=192.28s)]
*  Presidents just attack countries. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=196.16s)]
*  This is normal American unilateralism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=197.8s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=200.32s)]
*  Our allies supported us in 1991 when we went to war with Iraq. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=201.52s)]
*  Our allies supported us in 2001 when we went to war with Afghanistan. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=205.76s)]
*  Our allies were split when we went to war with Iraq in 2003. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=211.4s)]
*  But then President George W. Bush had a majority in the Senate and the Congress that supported [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=216.0s)]
*  that action. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=221.68s)]
*  In 2011, when I worked at the White House for President Obama, our allies supported [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=222.68s)]
*  us again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=227.56s)]
*  And we had Security Council resolutions from the United Nations because Russia and China [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=228.72s)]
*  abstained to support that action. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=234.84s)]
*  What's unique about this action today is there's no congressional support, no UN Security Council [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=237.88s)]
*  resolution support, and no resolution from NATO or any of our other allies. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  We went it alone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's significantly different than all those wars and attacks that I just described. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=250.84s)]
*  Do you see Russia's involvement in this potentially with Iran for a lack of desire or a lack of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  capabilities? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=263.32s)]
*  Because obviously, Russia is embroiled in the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=264.52s)]
*  It had to rely on Ukrainian drones and even close range ballistic missiles. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=268.36s)]
*  Why would Russia now not, if it could, and that's what I'm asking you, do you think it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=275.64s)]
*  can versus it doesn't want to? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=280.08s)]
*  But if it could, why wouldn't it want to help Iran, a country that has stood by it in its [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=282.64s)]
*  invasion and war in Ukraine? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=286.96s)]
*  That's a great question and I don't have a great answer to. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  I think their capabilities are very limited. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=293.44s)]
*  They are fully overextended in Ukraine. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=296.0s)]
*  And the idea of shipping weapons, some have been speculating, we're going to give Iran [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=304.96s)]
*  The former president of Russia said that, Dmitry Medvedev, in the last 24 hours. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=306.0s)]
*  I don't think they have a lot of capabilities. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=310.64s)]
*  That's in the short run. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=313.2s)]
*  In the medium term to long term, two things are very clear. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=314.72s)]
*  One, we'll never have a UN Security Council resolution trying to prevent Iran from obtaining [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=318.96s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=327.3s)]
*  Remember, the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal from 2015, that just wasn't the United States [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=328.48s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=334.24s)]
*  Russia was a part of that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  We will never have them together to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=337.76s)]
*  And second, in the long run, when Russia does have that capabilities, I think we should [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  fully expect that when Russia can, Russia will help Iran against us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  I just think that the world is divided now and they are together and hopefully we will [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=355.88s)]
*  put together a coalition of allies in the future. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=362.12s)]
*  But in the long run, you will see Russia much more supportive of Iran. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=365.88s)]
*  Think about their missile defense systems, S-400s, S-500s. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=370.56s)]
*  Those are the kinds of weapons that we used to help prevent Iran from having that I think [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=375.32s)]
*  they will now have in the future. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=381.36s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul, Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, was on some of the Sunday shows [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=383.52s)]
*  and said something to the effect of France and Germany should be supportive of what we've [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=389.76s)]
*  done in bombing Iran because Iran has been in violation of the JCPOA, which those other [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=394.6s)]
*  countries I guess are still party to even though we are not. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you make of that argument? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=404.88s)]
*  So why not convince them before you bomb Iran? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=408.2s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, why not make that coalition before the military action? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=411.92s)]
*  And by the way, why not convince members of Congress that this threat is imminent and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  it has to be done now? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=422.04s)]
*  That to me puts the United States in a much stronger position to try to have to convince [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=424.48s)]
*  half of America after the fact and our allies after the fact I think just makes us look [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  much weaker. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=436.36s)]
*  And I'm prepared to listen to that argument and think that maybe this had to be done now [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=437.36s)]
*  but they chose to strike first and then ask people to support later both the Democratic [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=443.52s)]
*  Party and our allies. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=449.8s)]
*  I just think that's exactly the wrong sequence of events. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=451.48s)]
*  Ambassador Michael McFaul, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YivwCx1b914&t=455.92s)]
