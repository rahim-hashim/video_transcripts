# What is the state of Iran’s nuclear program? Trump insists sites are ‘totally destroyed’
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0)
*  Joining us now, Mark Polymeropoulos, former CIA officer and MSNBC national security and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=0.0s)]
*  intelligence analyst. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=5.48s)]
*  Michael Crowley is diplomatic correspondent for the New York Times. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=7.2s)]
*  Great to have both of you here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=10.68s)]
*  So Mark, right now, how do we imagine the intelligence community is working to determine [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=12.52s)]
*  whether these sites were destroyed, as the president suggested? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=17.18s)]
*  And I wonder actually if a definitive assessment realistically is possible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=21.6s)]
*  Well, Chris, it's going to take some time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=26.0s)]
*  Clearly, with the Iran-Israel crisis at the top of the foreign policy agenda, there's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=28.88s)]
*  no more important priority for the intelligence community. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=33.56s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=35.76s)]
*  It means satellite imagery, which actually you see even commercial satellite imagery [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=37.08s)]
*  that you just showed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=41.04s)]
*  That's not going to tell us a whole lot, but then it goes to things such as signals intelligence, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=42.36s)]
*  which is intercepts of Iranian communications, leadership communications, intelligence, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=46.56s)]
*  their intelligence services, their scientific community. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=51.56s)]
*  And then it's going to be human sources on the ground. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=54.44s)]
*  What human assets do we have who've penetrated the various Iranian institutions that could [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=56.68s)]
*  tell us what they're saying and thinking? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=61.52s)]
*  Throw on top of that the Israeli community, intelligence community as well, and the intelligence [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=63.64s)]
*  communities of our partners, the French, the British and others, because this is really [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=68.28s)]
*  important. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=72.44s)]
*  You know, President Trump has made some very bold claims that the Iranian nuclear program [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=73.44s)]
*  has essentially been destroyed, but no real national security officials are going to say [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  that without first proper bomb damage assessment after the strikes, but also that kind of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  results of this intelligence soak. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=86.08s)]
*  And as Michael will certainly profess, this is really important for upcoming diplomatic [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=88.2s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  We have to know what Iran still has. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=94.4s)]
*  So a lot is riding on the performance of the intelligence community in the days and weeks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=96.76s)]
*  ahead. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, there is a nuclear policy analyst who talked to the New Yorker, Mark, who said if [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  the highly enriched uranium and centrifuge components are small, that means they're [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  portable, they can be moved around the country, they can be hidden. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  And it's not an insignificant amount. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=113.96s)]
*  The IAEA estimates 900 pounds. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=116.36s)]
*  So how do we know whether the highly enriched uranium and centrifuge components were moved, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=119.32s)]
*  as was suggested by some Iranian officials before those bombs ever hit? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=126.28s)]
*  And Chris was also suggested by the vice president, who I think backtracked a little [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=131.88s)]
*  bit. But at one point, he said that perhaps this 400 kilograms of near weapons grade [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  uranium may have been moved. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=140.64s)]
*  There was all these photos of trucks outside the photo facility. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  We don't know exactly what that means. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  There's different interpretations, of course, from different proliferation experts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=148.04s)]
*  But again, it's going to take intelligence to actually tell us if they were moved and, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=151.68s)]
*  of course, where they were moved. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=155.96s)]
*  There was an Israeli press report today quoting Israeli officials say they actually might [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=157.36s)]
*  know where it was moved to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=161.16s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes in terms of assessing exactly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=163.16s)]
*  what happened here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=167.44s)]
*  And again, it is critically important for what would be pending negotiations now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=168.2s)]
*  The Iranians over the program. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=172.28s)]
*  It certainly also is, Michael, a topic of conversation, if not the only topic of conversation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=174.04s)]
*  at the NATO summit where we just saw Air Force One land. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=179.4s)]
*  Do we think these world leaders all buy Trump's assessment? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=184.0s)]
*  How much of their own intelligence are they relying on? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=187.6s)]
*  Give us a sense of that and how it will shape these conversations. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=190.28s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, I don't think that they buy the president's assessment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=195.48s)]
*  And certainly no one is just going to go by, you know, a public assurance from the American [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=198.88s)]
*  president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=205.32s)]
*  They're going to be relying heavily on their own intelligence services. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=206.32s)]
*  And they're also going to want to see facts and evidence from Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=209.28s)]
*  Another piece of this, Chris, is that there are international nuclear inspectors whose [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=213.68s)]
*  job is to account for the state of Iran's program. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=219.32s)]
*  And a big question is whether and when the Iranians will let those U.N. inspectors see [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  what has happened to their facilities and will they offer a full accounting of where [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  all their uranium is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=236.72s)]
*  So if they can't essentially produce it and show it to inspectors, which I think is really [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=239.0s)]
*  what's going to be required here to get serious negotiations going, they're going to have [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=244.76s)]
*  to give some explanation for where it is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=248.72s)]
*  And until they do that, there's going to be a very dark shadow over them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is going to be in a state of flux and distrust. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=256.08s)]
*  And there can't be negotiations going forward. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  But you know, and maybe you want to turn to this, but I actually think that although there [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=263.36s)]
*  will be discussion about Iran here, Chris, there's some really big questions that are [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=267.4s)]
*  not related that are going to be hashed out at this NATO summit involving NATO's budgeting [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=270.56s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=275.44s)]
*  So this conversation might change pretty quickly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=276.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=278.48s)]
*  And when you talk about Ukraine, when you talk about Gaza, I mean, it's understandable [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=279.0s)]
*  that when America does something they've never done before, which is that they drop these [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=285.84s)]
*  bunker buster bombs in a surprise attack on a Saturday night, that that becomes a key [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  topic of conversation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=298.08s)]
*  But has it in the world distracted from all the other things that are going on and that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=300.32s)]
*  have dominated two other wars that have dominated the conversation for so long? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=305.08s)]
*  Oh, it's certainly distracted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=312.6s)]
*  And as I don't have to tell you, Chris, you know, a Trump presidency is just a constant [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=314.16s)]
*  sprint from one crisis or kettle boiling to another. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=321.2s)]
*  And it's hard for people to multitask and keep their focus on all the things that are [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=327.48s)]
*  happening. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=333.04s)]
*  I do think that for an organization like NATO, these two questions, number one, how much [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  is Trump going to force NATO members to increase their defense spending to this new target [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  of five percent of GDP, which is going to be a very tough hill for many of these members [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  to climb? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  How much is he going to demand this and perhaps imply that he won't defend or come to the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=352.76s)]
*  defense of NATO members who don't spend that much money? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=358.36s)]
*  That's a really big question for this organization. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=362.04s)]
*  And then the second one is Ukraine. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=365.0s)]
*  And although this Iran crisis is massive, the Ukraine war has been the dominant issue [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  for Ukraine for NATO since February of 2022. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=372.24s)]
*  And I think these countries are desperate to know whether the United States is walking [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  away from this war and ending its support for Kiev or whether President Trump could [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=379.72s)]
*  possibly be persuaded to provide more of the support that Ukraine desperately needs to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=384.24s)]
*  fight off the Russians at this point. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=389.14000000000004s)]
*  When you look at worldwide security, Mark, I mean, and the conversations that are going [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  on now, it's clear from what we've heard from the president, his extreme frustration [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=396.24s)]
*  that the ceasefire was broken. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=400.72s)]
*  It's clear that he wants to take an unambiguous victory lap for ending the war, ending the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=403.04s)]
*  conflict, killing any of Iran's nuclear ambitions. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  But there have to be concerns by other countries. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=414.88s)]
*  They get embroiled in a way they don't want to in all of this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=418.36s)]
*  And if Trump stokes divisions while he's there at NATO, could that just be playing into the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=421.9s)]
*  hands of Xi Jinping? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=427.46s)]
*  Well, Chris, I think that the big thing for the NATO summit certainly is this European [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=428.9s)]
*  defense spending, NATO defense spending at five percent. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=435.86s)]
*  And that's what Trump certainly wants. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=437.9s)]
*  You know, he actually released a rather incredible text message he received from the NATO Secretary [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=439.34s)]
*  General Rutte, which was kind of this sycophantic groveling saying that, you know, we're with [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=444.82s)]
*  you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=449.9s)]
*  We're going to get you to this percentage. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=450.9s)]
*  But I think the Europeans are doing this just to try desperately to get Trump to do something [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=451.9s)]
*  positive on Ukraine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=456.26s)]
*  And again, that really remains to be seen. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  There has been so many kind of threats of sanctions because of Vladimir Putin's intransigence. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  Nothing's happened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=466.38s)]
*  Zelensky will apparently be there at the meeting, so perhaps there'll be a Trump-Zelensky one-on-one. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=467.38s)]
*  But I think you're right when you say, too, that, you know, kind of China watches all [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=473.62s)]
*  of this dysfunction as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=476.54s)]
*  And Donald Trump ran on this notion of fixing all of the world's problems. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=478.3s)]
*  And it seems to me that certainly that's not transpired because, frankly, these are really [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3fAXOCFD0&t=481.46s)]
