# Evacuations From Afghanistan Hit Snags With Military 'Out Of The Equation'
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg)
*  Joining us now, NBC News' Pentagon correspondent Courtney Cooley and retired four-star general [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=0.0s)]
*  Barry McCaffrey. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=4.8s)]
*  Thanks to both, Courtney. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=6.44s)]
*  Really, Pakistan is the only exit strategy they've got. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=7.68s)]
*  We don't believe that the Russians are letting there be crossings, at least any continuous [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=11.8s)]
*  flow of crossings, to the stands. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=17.28s)]
*  China, similarly, on another border. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Iran is not a great place for any Americans to cross. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=21.64s)]
*  There's no U.S. embassy support there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=26.28s)]
*  But in Pakistan, there has been some evidence of U.S. embassy help. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=33.28s)]
*  I mean, look, the reality is there are two ways for people to get out of Afghanistan, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=33.92s)]
*  over land or via air. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=38.040000000000006s)]
*  We've seen just in the last couple of days how difficult it is for air right now, what [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=39.88s)]
*  with these reports of Americans and others who are sitting on the tarmac in Masri Sharif [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=44.72s)]
*  trying to get on these charter flights and the Taliban not allowing them to. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=49.36s)]
*  And keep in mind that not all the airports are fully operational at this point. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  So even so, that presents just a logistical hurdle in and of itself. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  But then, as you rightly point out, Andrea, there are only so many options for leaving [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  via land. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And those are also not only fraught with peril just to get to these crossings, to get [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=68.4s)]
*  to the one like the one we just saw Molly at, but then getting through them can be difficult [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=72.6s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=76.4s)]
*  And then they find a potentially inhospitable place to where they get where they're [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=76.88s)]
*  arriving anyway, with potentially thousands of refugees arriving in some of these countries [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=81.88s)]
*  like Pakistan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  The countries may not necessarily want to take them in. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=88.44s)]
*  So the situation, definitely very difficult and very few options for particularly for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  military, where I'm standing right here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  The options going forward are going to largely be diplomatic in nature. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=99.36s)]
*  You will know, Andrea, it's going to be the United States diplomats working with potentially [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=102.8s)]
*  the Taliban, most likely through an intermediary, to figure out ways to get Americans and at-risk [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=108.88s)]
*  Afghans still out of that country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=113.64s)]
*  And generally, yesterday I talked to Aisha Tanzeem of Voice of America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  She's in Pakistan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  She got out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=121.44s)]
*  But so many of her colleagues didn't. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  And I tried to clarify yesterday that Voice of America is not any longer part of the State [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=124.0s)]
*  Department and is a totally independent agency, but it is funded by the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=129.04s)]
*  government. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of these Voice of America staff feel very much betrayed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=132.96s)]
*  They felt that they should have gotten out, along with other international media colleagues. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Andrea, I wasn't sure if that was to me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, the bottom line is the military is now out of the equation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=147.72s)]
*  We have very little leverage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=152.56s)]
*  The Pakistanis and the Chinese do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=154.12s)]
*  The hypocrisy inside the D.C. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Beltway is unbelievable. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Two presidents, Trump and Biden, made legitimate decisions, political decisions, to withdraw [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  the military forces. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=169.12s)]
*  We haven't had combat troops there, only air power and special ops for two years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  It predictably collapsed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=176.08s)]
*  I don't think anyone who is aware of the situation on the ground thought it would do anything [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=178.84s)]
*  but that. You know, the surprise was that it went under within a matter of a few days and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  weeks. So right now, Courtney's report is out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=188.24s)]
*  It's dead on the money. The military is not going to play a role. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=191.08s)]
*  Pakistan is not going to welcome millions of refugees through their crossing points. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=194.52s)]
*  They'll cross all up and down that thousand mile border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=200.84s)]
*  They'll filter into Iran, which they're doing by the thousands. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=205.44s)]
*  This will go on for years, escaping this repressive rural Pashtun, Taliban movement. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=208.8s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=217.12s)]
*  And let's talk for a moment, General, about this new Taliban acting government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  So in this new regime, none of the coalition partners that the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  had hoped for, Abdullah Abdullah or Hamid Karzai, not surprisingly, they've kept to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=227.36s)]
*  their own, but also including several members of the Haqqani network, people with al-Qaeda [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  links, they're on FBI wanted lists, they've got bounties on their heads. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  The interior minister is one, Haqqani himself. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=241.52s)]
*  So, you know, how do we deal with them to help get our people out? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=245.12s)]
*  Why should they be recognized? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  But how do we alienate them? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=252.36s)]
*  But they're dealing with al-Qaeda, the very people that we defeated 20 years ago. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=254.44s)]
*  Well, you know, I dealt with Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan and we're despicable and you [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=259.92s)]
*  couldn't find he's a, I think, a significant part of the reason that there was no [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=264.68s)]
*  American public support for this war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=269.44s)]
*  Now, I also think that, you know, when you when you we have an 18th century [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=273.04s)]
*  notion of diplomacy in the public dialogue right now, we already recognize the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  Taliban. We're dealing with them in Doha. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  General Donahue and the military dealt with him tactically day after day. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=286.8s)]
*  We need to get an interest section back into our embassy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  The Haqqani network is a major criminal and terrorist, more than a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=295.76s)]
*  religious jihadist. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=302.36s)]
*  But that's who they are. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=304.04s)]
*  So if we actually want to work, you know, deliberately on getting hundreds of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  thousands of Afghans out who identify with democracy, freedom, individual rights, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=311.72s)]
*  women's rights, then we got to get get on the ground. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H90EDWvGKg&t=318.24s)]
