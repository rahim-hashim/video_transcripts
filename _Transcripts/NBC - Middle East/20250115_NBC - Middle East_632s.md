# ‘More work to be done’: Father of American-Israeli hostage reacts to Israel-Hamas ceasefire
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik)
*  I want to bring in Ruby Hen, the father of Itai Hen, an American Israeli hostage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=5.12s)]
*  What are you feeling right now about this apparent ceasefire deal? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=7.76s)]
*  Well, I think gratitude to President Biden and his team, specifically Mr. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=13.24s)]
*  Buttigieg, NSC coordinator to the Middle East that has been camping out in Qatar, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=19.36s)]
*  as well as the Trump administration and specifically Mr. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=26.04s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy that also has been in Qatar the last week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=29.36s)]
*  We are very grateful for what is happening, but at the moment it seems that it is a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=38.68s)]
*  partial deal and it is somehow connected to a second phase that will only happen in a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=45.56s)]
*  number of weeks. And my son, a U.S. citizen, as well as four other U.S. citizens, are still [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=52.2s)]
*  going to be put in the second phase. So it just means that there needs more work to be done [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=60.36s)]
*  to enable me and 64 other families to be reunited with their family members still in Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=67.16s)]
*  Can you help people to understand what this 15 months have been like for you and your family? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=76.36s)]
*  Yeah, as you see, I have this patch here, 467, so it changes every day. It's a constant [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=84.68s)]
*  question. What do I do today that will move the latan with my son one inch? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=92.44s)]
*  Last week, we decided myself and my wife that the best place to be actually is in Qatar. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=99.16s)]
*  To be close to the negotiators, we felt as if having a list of names on an Excel sheet is not [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=106.04s)]
*  the same as needing to look somebody in the eye and having him question you about where we are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  in the negotiations and making sure that we're doing everything possible. So me and my wife, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=120.28s)]
*  we've been officials from the Qatar government, from the prime minister office, minister of state, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=125.72s)]
*  NSA, as well as meeting Mr. Brett McGuck and also in contact with Mr. Steve Witkoff and urging him [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=131.88s)]
*  to be physically in Qatar in order to provide the guarantees that the Biden administration has been [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=140.68s)]
*  providing for this agreement that the Trump administration would also guarantee as well [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=148.2s)]
*  those pieces of the agreement that were needed to make sure that we could get to where we are now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=155.96s)]
*  As you have been living this, there have been times when it looked like a deal might be close [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=164.68s)]
*  and then it turned out not to be. And I wonder how confident you are right now [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  that this ceasefire deal will indeed bring back all of the hostages still held in Gaza? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=174.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's the billion dollar question. I think there's a lot of positive energy, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=179.0s)]
*  I think, since the elections. The Trump effect has provided the negotiators extra motivation to get [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  this done. It is a framework, but as it is being conveyed to us, there's only the first part [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=193.72s)]
*  being guaranteed. The second phase is still questionable, as it is the Middle East. It's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=201.72s)]
*  only a match right away from blowing up always. And the only thing predictable about the Middle [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=211.88s)]
*  East is it being unpredictable. So we need to try as much as possible to push that the second phase, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=217.24s)]
*  with at least the additional hostages, happens as soon as possible. And hopefully both sides will [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=225.56s)]
*  see the benefit of the ceasefire and understand that we need to move quickly to a more permanent [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=231.16s)]
*  ceasefire and get the hostages out, as well as also starting to try to give the people of Gaza [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=238.28s)]
*  that have been a human shield for this terrorist organization the humanitarian aid that is also [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=248.12s)]
*  required for them to be able to start beginning and piecing their lives together. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=253.72s)]
*  You mentioned that you and your wife were in Doha during these negotiations, and in fact, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=258.36s)]
*  you've traveled the world. You have been a relentless advocate for your son. So I remember [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  about Ita. He was a big basketball fan, right? NBA fan, that he was an athlete himself. But [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=270.12s)]
*  tell people about your son. Yeah, so just about the basketball piece. You know, I'm a New Yorker, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=276.92s)]
*  as you could hear, and, you know, a very proud New York Knicks fan. And for the love of God, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=283.88s)]
*  I do not know how I became a Celtics fan. So, you know, that was one of the things we would talk a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=289.88s)]
*  lot about. He is the middle child. So he has an elder sibling and a younger sibling. So he is the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=295.0s)]
*  connector. Very loving, you know, life of the party, always in the middle of things, same stances. He [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=302.92s)]
*  has a loving girlfriend waiting for him. We still question what his status indeed is. We were [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=309.64s)]
*  notified, according to intelligence, but it's difficult to explain. But there's no physical [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=321.08s)]
*  evidence. And Hamas has not provided any statement about him. So, you know, we just got out of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=328.52s)]
*  Christmas and Hanukkah, the season of miracles. Maybe there's something waiting for us as well. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=335.32s)]
*  We just want to have closure and be able to have an ending to this chapter and end our suffering [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  and be able to move and process, you know, whatever the future has in store for us. But [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=350.36s)]
*  Italy will always be a big part of our lives. And it's so unfortunate, you know, there's no [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=356.92s)]
*  competition in pain. And there's been too much pain for these 15 months. And I am, again, grateful [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=364.76s)]
*  to the U.S. administrations as well as the Qatar officials and Egypt and anyone that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=372.76s)]
*  has helped us get to this point. But as I said, the work is not done. There are still U.S. citizens [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=380.76s)]
*  that will be still hostages even after this first phase. And the United States should and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=386.2s)]
*  does have a commitment. And I know after meeting Mr. Mike Walz and Mr. Steve Witkoff and Mr. Adam [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=392.12s)]
*  Boller, all of them have showed their personal commitment to me and to my family to getting this [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=398.84s)]
*  done. And, you know, next week, we will be at the inauguration. We were invited by the President [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=404.36s)]
*  Trump's inauguration team. And I have this vision that, you know, when President Trump [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=411.4s)]
*  is giving a speech, he could come and say to me, Mr. Khan, I'd like to share with you that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=419.56s)]
*  your son is coming out as well. So I still have that hope of happening. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  You've mentioned so many of the people who have worked so tirelessly over the course of these 467 [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=429.23999999999995s)]
*  days to make this moment a reality. But there is, of course, the deeply personal side, the families [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=436.36s)]
*  of the other hostages. And no one can fully understand what this time has been like in the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=442.36s)]
*  way that they can. How much of a we just got I should say we just got a statement from the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=448.44s)]
*  families of the American hostages and thanking the tireless collaboration between Israel, Egypt, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=453.48s)]
*  Qatar and the United States and going on to mention the work that was done. But what have [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  those relationships meant to you through this time? Yeah, so I tried to backstack and see how [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=465.88s)]
*  many times we talked and met Mr. Jake Sullivan, national security adviser. It was 24 times [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=474.36s)]
*  since this ordeal happened. You know, I think it's extraordinary. The amount of effort that he has [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=481.32s)]
*  put in. We, the U.S. families, you know, have been on a constant journey through the White House and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=487.64s)]
*  the Senate, Congress. I think it's also important to mention the bipartisan support that we have [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  gotten from Congress and Senate and urging the 119th Congress as well to do even more to put [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=502.68s)]
*  pressure on the parties to make sure that they're doing whatever is needed to get all the hostages [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=512.6s)]
*  out. They have different levers that have not been used yet. And I urge our friends in Congress to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=518.04s)]
*  also make sure that there's no daylight between the House and the Trump administration. And we, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=524.84s)]
*  the families, have become a very intimate group of people that have been able to share, you know, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=532.84s)]
*  tragedy one with the other. And it is bittersweet. Like, you know, we're very happy [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=541.8s)]
*  for those that are coming out. Many families will be reunited, the women, children, elderly. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=548.52s)]
*  But still, you know, it's still a feeling that there's more to be done. It is not like November, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=555.64s)]
*  last November, where we had the women and children coming out and there was no expectation, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=564.92s)]
*  at least from my end, that it I as a young male would come out. But after 467 days, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=569.56s)]
*  everyone is humanitarian. Gani, Judy, Idan, Sagih, Omel, Keith, they're all family members, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=578.3599999999999s)]
*  and we want them all out. So we are grateful. And it's a time to be joyful for those that will be [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=587.0s)]
*  reunited. But there's still work to be done. Well, I know that so many people who are watching [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=596.28s)]
*  will pray along with you and your family, Ruby, for a miracle, for Itai. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=602.76s)]
*  Ruby Hen, thank you so much for being on the program. I'm much appreciated. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSs7uVGsAik&t=626.28s)]
