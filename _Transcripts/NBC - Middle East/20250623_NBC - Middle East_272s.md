# Trump ordering strikes on Iran with no congressional approval ‘could be’ impeachable: Dem Rep
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4)
*  And here with me now, Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, Chris D'Aluzio. He's an Iraq war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=0.0s)]
*  veteran and a member of the Armed Services Committee. And, Congressman, you were one of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=4.48s)]
*  those co-sponsors to that bipartisan war powers resolution, saying it is the responsibility of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=8.24s)]
*  Congress to authorize declaring war. The president did not get authorization before launching these [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=13.52s)]
*  strikes on Iran. What is your reaction to where we stand right now? Congress didn't authorize this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=18.8s)]
*  No president of any party has the ability on their own to start a war. Sending American aircraft over [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=23.44s)]
*  another country, dropping bombs, that's risking starting a war. And certainly the Congress has a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=28.96s)]
*  role to play. I hope more of my Republican colleagues join us to stand up for the American [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=33.6s)]
*  people. I'm a veteran of the war in Iraq. I remember what that debate was. At least there was a debate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=38.0s)]
*  I think they got it wrong then. We've had no chance to have a debate, to present evidence to the American [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=43.2s)]
*  people, to see the case the administration is making for why they should authorize these strikes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=47.6s)]
*  Congress has that power. Congress alone has that power. I mean, this is your second term in Congress, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  but we've seen for decades multiple administrations, presidents from both parties, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=56.88s)]
*  skirt going to Congress before launching some kind of military action. Is this any different? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=62.32s)]
*  I think it's the same problem we're seeing now happen with this president. We've seen across [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=67.84s)]
*  generations. Why do you think that is, that presidents don't feel like they need to come [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=71.68s)]
*  to Congress? I think it's been too easy. They've been relying on an authorization going back to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=75.84s)]
*  2001 against al-Qaeda to launch strikes for years, well beyond what Congress had intended. The American [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  people should have more of a say in this. And look, we are going to pay for the cost of the wars [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=86.4s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan for as long as my generation of veterans is alive. We owe it to the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=90.72s)]
*  American people to make these decisions wisely, to argue in full public view about the merits of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  starting a war. None of that has happened. This president decided on his own, and it is Congress's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=101.76s)]
*  responsibility to decide whether we send Americans to war. Your colleague, Congresswoman Ocasio [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=106.72s)]
*  Cortez, said President Trump's actions in Iran could be an impeachable offense. Do you agree? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=111.92s)]
*  They could be. I think he broke the Constitution. Let's be clear. It is Congress's power [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=118.4s)]
*  through the American people who elect us to decide whether we go to war, whether we authorize military [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=122.64s)]
*  action. Every president has the power to defend Americans, no doubt. That's not what this was. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=127.12s)]
*  This was an offensive attack on another country. Our colleague, Kristen Welker, actually asked the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=131.68s)]
*  vice president directly about whether this was the U.S. declaring war on Iran. Take a listen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=136.72s)]
*  My first question, Mr. Vice President, is the United States now at war with Iran? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=141.92s)]
*  No, Kristen, we're not at war with Iran. We're at war with Iran's nuclear program. What we did is we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  destroyed the Iranian nuclear program. I think we set that program back substantially, and we did it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=156.72s)]
*  without endangering the lives of the American pilots. He says the U.S. is not at war with Iran, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  but at war with Iran's nuclear program. What do you make of that distinction? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=168.88s)]
*  That sounds like something a Yale Law School lawyer would argue. You've bombed Iran. You're [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  certainly escalating things. We have tens of thousands of Americans in the Middle East, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=176.72s)]
*  many service members at ships at sea. They are at risk now. And we know how narrow the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=181.2s)]
*  Strait of Hormuz is. The Iranians have long threatened to shut down shipping through the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=185.2s)]
*  Strait of Hormuz, which would affect global energy markets and more. This is a very risky [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=189.2s)]
*  situation for the country. Your fellow lawmaker from Pennsylvania, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=193.2s)]
*  Democratic Senator John Fetterman, is supportive of these strikes. He called it the correct move. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=196.24s)]
*  What would you say to him about that? I disagree. We have a role in Congress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  The American people expect us to have a say on something as important as deciding whether this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  country goes to war. What's the point of being a senator or a member of Congress if you're not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  going to do your duty? And our duty is to say something here and be clear that that power [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=215.36s)]
*  lies with us, not the president. But here we are. So instead of looking backwards, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  what do you plan to do moving forward? And what is your biggest concern right now? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=223.52s)]
*  Well, my concern is the president's going to put us into another regional war that will last for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=227.12s)]
*  who knows how long in the Middle East. What we should be doing is taking up one of these [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=230.72s)]
*  war powers resolutions to constrain the president's ability to further escalate for Congress to take [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=234.24s)]
*  back some of that power so that we are debating this in full view of the American people, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=239.68s)]
*  of whether there is something that we should put American lives on the line for. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=243.52s)]
*  That debate has not happened at all. Congressman Chris D'Aluzio, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=246.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EpK1KggpI4&t=253.52s)]
