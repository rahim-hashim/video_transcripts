# Netanyahu’s ‘political interests’ affect exchanges with Hezbollah: fmr. national security advisor
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18)
*  Joining me now, we have Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser and an MSNBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=0.0s)]
*  political contributor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=4.8s)]
*  Good to see you, Ben. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=5.8s)]
*  I'm awfully glad you're here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=6.8s)]
*  I'm curious what you think Netanyahu means when he says he will do whatever it takes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=7.8s)]
*  How concerned are you by this escalation? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=13.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm very concerned. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=15.16s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this kind of at a low boil throughout the conflict since October 7th. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  The U.S., as recently as a few days ago before the Pager attack, had been trying to negotiate [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=23.88s)]
*  some de-escalation to avoid precisely this scenario. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=30.84s)]
*  And I think when he talks about whatever it takes, I think what's in people's minds is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=33.72s)]
*  will there continue to be a kind of large-scale airstrikes into Lebanon? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=37.92s)]
*  Will there potentially be some kind of Israeli ground incursions, some kind of ground operation [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=43.28s)]
*  into Lebanon, which would dramatically kind of raise the stakes there as well? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=48.56s)]
*  In reprisal, Hezbollah could fire a significant number of rockets, more than they have been [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=53.04s)]
*  doing, into Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  They could also try to undertake certain acts of terrorism, acts of violence inside of Israel's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=60.56s)]
*  borders. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=65.12s)]
*  And all of this, and I think this is what the U.S. is concerned about, could also further [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=66.12s)]
*  set the region aflame. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=70.5s)]
*  You could see violence in a place like Iraq, where Hezbollah has close supporters and the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=72.1s)]
*  U.S. has a large diplomatic presence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=78.2s)]
*  You could see Iran getting drawn in, given how close they are with Hezbollah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=80.14s)]
*  Netanyahu's not being very specific, but the trend is clearly not good in terms of escalation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=83.76s)]
*  Is it clear to you, Ben, why Israel chose this past week to set off the pager and walkie-talkie [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=88.28s)]
*  explosions in Lebanon? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=93.48s)]
*  Well, look, on the security side of things, they've had for months now a large population [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=95.44s)]
*  that's displaced in northern Israel, a lot of frustration about the inability of them [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=101.56s)]
*  to return home because of the Hezbollah rocket fire. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  I think what the U.S. is focused on is that if you get a ceasefire in Gaza, that that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=108.56s)]
*  all goes away and that there's a diplomatic solution that can return those people home [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=113.26s)]
*  and recover the hostages. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Alex, I mean, it's Prime Minister Netanyahu, and so I think there's also, and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=119.2s)]
*  this is not a view just of my own, this is a widely held view in Israel, his own politics [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=124.44s)]
*  have always kind of factored in his decision-making. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=130.8s)]
*  And the longer he's perpetuating these military operations, the longer he's presenting himself [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=133.6s)]
*  as the kind of indispensable man for Israel's security, that is keeping his political standing, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  keeping him in power. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  And frankly, I think, you know, in our own election cycle, he might see the time before [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  an election as a time when U.S. criticism of him may be muted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=150.36s)]
*  And so there's always a political dynamic, usually with Netanyahu, and I think he sees [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=155.08s)]
*  this as both something that is necessary, although I agree with the criticism from John [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Kirby that I don't think it's going to help return people home. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=165.56s)]
*  A war along Israel's northern border is not necessarily the clearest pathway to return [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=167.6s)]
*  those people to their homes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=172.84s)]
*  But I also think he has some political interests that are at stake here, too. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=173.84s)]
*  Yeah, it is starting to feel like the U.S. is kind of toothless when it comes to the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=178.96s)]
*  Middle East conflict. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=186.28s)]
*  I mean, it just it just seems to be getting worse. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=187.28s)]
*  Right, Ben? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=189.84s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal, I'm looking at a report this week, senior U.S. officials aren't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=190.84s)]
*  giving up, but they are not expecting a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas before Biden's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=195.28s)]
*  term. And how much of a problem is it that Joe Biden is essentially I mean, look, he's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  a lame duck president right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  Does it leave the U.S. without any leverage? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=207.84s)]
*  Yes, because he's not been willing to use any leverage in terms of trying to compel a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=213.24s)]
*  ceasefire. And look, there's been essentially a two pronged plan from the Biden administration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=217.84s)]
*  over the course of the last year. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=223.4s)]
*  One is to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas that leads to the return [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  of hostages and kind of creates a context for the war to end. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  And two, to have the Saudis normalize relations with Israel as a means of kind of unlocking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=234.28s)]
*  some pathway to greater peace in the region. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Clearly, those ceasefire talks have died. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  And no matter how many times they send people to the region, both Israel and Hamas are moving [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=245.4s)]
*  further apart. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=249.72000000000003s)]
*  When you have this kind of escalation, these kinds of attacks on Hezbollah, that doesn't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=250.6s)]
*  exactly create a climate where you think you're going to get a ceasefire deal either. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=253.96s)]
*  And just the other day, Mohammed bin Salman announced that he would never normalize relations [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=256.92s)]
*  with Israel, absent a Palestinian state, which is essentially a signal that that pathway [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=261.76s)]
*  is dead, too. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=265.96s)]
*  And the problem is that they haven't had a plan B, Alex, not being willing to say, you [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=266.76s)]
*  know what, if Netanyahu is not willing to make this ceasefire deal to get the hostages [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=271.64s)]
*  back and to get some calm there, then we'll look at using some leverage, suspending some [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=274.96s)]
*  arm shipments to Israel, voting a certain way at the UN Security Council. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=280.64s)]
*  If you're essentially saying we're going around the region and we're telling people what we [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=284.36s)]
*  would like to happen, but we're not putting real leverage behind it, what we've seen is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=288.48s)]
*  that there are actors in the region, including close friends like Israel, that are just [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=293.44s)]
*  beginning to tune that out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=297.12s)]
*  And I think that creates a kind of pretty unstable period here, as we're going to have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=298.68s)]
*  an election, there's going to be a transition either to a Harris or a Trump administration. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=303.44s)]
*  This could be a very volatile time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=307.76s)]
*  Transitions usually are Alex after both Obama elections in 2008 and 12, there was a Gaza [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=309.32s)]
*  war. You know, the transitions are oftentimes when leaders try to do things, knowing that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=314.44s)]
*  the U.S. is a bit distracted and inward focused. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=319.04s)]
*  And I think that's unfortunately the kind of unstable window that we're in right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=321.28s)]
*  And I know, Ben, you just signed onto a letter with 700 national security leaders endorsing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=326.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris. So what could she do to bring a diplomatic end to this conflict, to bring [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=333.0s)]
*  back the hostages, prevent the U.S. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=339.08s)]
*  from being dragged into another war? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  Would continuing Biden's policies be the best approach to trying to make that happen? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=343.24s)]
*  I mean, I think like she's going to bring a new energy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  There'll be a burst of energy with a Harris election. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=352.64s)]
*  It'll be very welcome around the world, overwhelmingly welcomed around the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=355.0s)]
*  She'll have a lot of political capital, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  She won't have that kind of lame duck status hangover. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=361.0s)]
*  That alone, I think, is a positive reset in the event of a Harris victory. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=363.28s)]
*  But then also, I think she needs to kind of go back to the drawing board. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=367.0s)]
*  She's talked about, you know, and she has used a different tone when it comes to calling [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=369.84s)]
*  out Prime Minister Netanyahu and his willingness to kind of ignore the United States and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=373.88s)]
*  obviously the circumstances for the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=378.64s)]
*  I think she needs to kind of look at what are the tools, both in terms of trying to get [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=382.0s)]
*  a near term ceasefire. Is there leverage that can be brought to bear? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=385.4s)]
*  But really importantly, Alex, part of what is needed now is a vision. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=387.88s)]
*  Where is this all going? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=391.4s)]
*  What are we aiming for? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  A ceasefire alone wouldn't even solve the problems there, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=393.96s)]
*  Who's going to rebuild Gaza? Who's going to run Gaza? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=396.64s)]
*  I think she can come in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=398.84s)]
*  And it's as much about what is happening in the inbox today. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=400.32s)]
*  Even more so, it's about sketching out a vision of where is U.S. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=403.52s)]
*  leadership trying to go in this region beyond putting out fires? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=406.84s)]
*  And I think she has the opportunity to do that in a way that even a second term, Joe [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=410.52s)]
*  Biden, wouldn't. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=415.56s)]
*  OK, sage advice and perspective is always my friend. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=416.48s)]
*  Thank you, Ben Rhodes. Appreciate you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZOAi_uz18&t=419.84s)]
