# Gaza tragedies will ‘harden’ positions of Israel, Hamas in ceasefire delay Fmr. Mid-East expert
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8)
*  NBC's Hala Gurani joins us live on the ground in Beirut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Erin David Miller is a senior fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=3.56s)]
*  Hala, what more can you tell us about the tragic deaths of both these journalists and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  these babies? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=12.52s)]
*  Well, we're seeing on the ground footage of a press vehicle, clearly marked press, which [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=13.52s)]
*  was parked, according to the hospital, outside of hospital grounds of Auda Hospital, which [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=22.6s)]
*  is in the central part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=27.16s)]
*  We understand that there were five journalists inside that vehicle and that the vehicle was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=30.16s)]
*  targeted while they were sleeping inside of it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  One of the journalists, according to reports, was at the hospital because his wife was in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=38.28s)]
*  labor about to give birth to their child. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=44.0s)]
*  So the five journalists were killed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=47.16s)]
*  They worked for Al-Quds Television, which is a Gaza-based TV station. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=49.46s)]
*  The IDF said that it targeted in that part of Gaza a Palestinian Islamic Jihad target [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=54.92s)]
*  there without really providing evidence of that, of the fact that it was militants that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  it was targeting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  We actually, for NBC News over the last year, have conducted investigations into the record [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=71.44s)]
*  number of journalists' deaths in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=76.4s)]
*  Right now, the Committee to Protect Journalists is saying that the number of media workers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=80.08s)]
*  and reporters killed in the Gaza Strip since October 7th of 2023 has now risen to 141, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=85.4s)]
*  which is a record number since it began counting in 1992. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=93.84s)]
*  And there have been many instances where the IDF, the Israeli military, has said that they've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=99.4s)]
*  targeted militants. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=104.2s)]
*  One example, for example, Ismail Al-Ghul, who was an Al Jazeera reporter, it produced [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=105.64s)]
*  documentation that showed that he was a Hamas militant when he would have been 10 years [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=111.88s)]
*  old, for example. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=117.12s)]
*  So a lot of this evidence, when poured over by journalists and by investigators, sometimes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=118.12s)]
*  really doesn't hold up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=123.56s)]
*  And there are accusations, certainly among Palestinians, that there is an attempt to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=125.4s)]
*  deliberately target media workers, Chris. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=129.66s)]
*  So Erin, we have been here before. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=133.44s)]
*  We have talked about tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=137.24s)]
*  And it does come to a point, you know, whether we're talking about what's happening in Afghanistan, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  whether we're talking about what happens in Gaza, that people can become exhausted, right, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=149.24s)]
*  immune to the horrors of war, the very real horrors of war. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=155.88s)]
*  Do you think any of this breaks through? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=159.92s)]
*  Does any of this give any impetus at all to a deal that we keep hearing is close but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=162.08s)]
*  never quite comes together? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=169.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=171.52s)]
*  I wish I had better news for the new year. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it does. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=176.8s)]
*  I think this simply hardens. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=178.56s)]
*  The positions of the two major combatants, the Israelis are determined, look, the war [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=181.28s)]
*  in Gaza, for all practical purposes, should be over. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=186.0s)]
*  The Israelis have destroyed Hamas as a military organization. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=189.6s)]
*  Now the issue is whether or not they want to prevent Hamas from emerging as any sort [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=192.6s)]
*  of organized entity at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=197.84s)]
*  And it centers around the reality that this Israeli government is simply determined to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=200.32s)]
*  prevent Hamas from gaining any political victories. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=205.68s)]
*  And as a consequence, I think, you have a hardening of Israel's positions, and Hamas's, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=209.2s)]
*  in terms of any sort of hostage deal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  The major issues separating the two combatants now are the character and number of Palestinian [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=219.56s)]
*  prisoners, many with blood on their hands, to be released, and the numbers of Israelis [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=225.84s)]
*  that will be released in a first phase. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=231.64s)]
*  Hamas can't provide proof of life on the numbers of Israeli hostages who are being held and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=234.88s)]
*  where the bodies of those who have died are buried. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=239.72s)]
*  And so this whole issue is now caught up and even made worse, I think, to a degree, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=243.32s)]
*  by the transition that we're about to experience to a new administration. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=250.0s)]
*  And I think this figure could figure, in part, the prime minister of Israel has accepted [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=256.12s)]
*  an invitation, according to reports, to attend the inauguration. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=261.2s)]
*  I hope his calculation is not to wait until the new president is inaugurated in an effort [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=264.4s)]
*  either to give Donald Trump a political victory in claiming that he was responsible for the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=271.12s)]
*  release of the hostages or to use Donald Trump's justification for making the kinds of concessions [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=277.8s)]
*  that the Israelis are having a hard time making with respect to the numbers of Palestinian [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=285.24s)]
*  prisoners that are going to be released in a first phase. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's complicated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, Chris, the hostages, their families, two million Palestinians in Gaza have suffered [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=296.56s)]
*  far too long. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=302.48s)]
*  All of these, its tragedy and innocence are caught up, including journalists. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=304.4s)]
*  So you understand negotiating. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=310.88s)]
*  You've been involved in very complex negotiations. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=313.08s)]
*  So let me ask you this question. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=316.48s)]
*  When you get to a point like this, and maybe there aren't exact parallels because, as you [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=318.32s)]
*  say, we're going to have a transition from two very different kinds of administrations [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=324.28s)]
*  with very different relationships with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=329.96s)]
*  But if there is to be a breakthrough, how does that happen? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=334.2s)]
*  You know, from my experience in negotiations, and this is one that is different, I've never [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=340.84s)]
*  been involved in a negotiation between two combatants, one an organized terror group [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  which willfully and indiscriminately killed Israeli civilians and took them hostage, and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=350.48s)]
*  the government of Israel, which is visited in an effort to prosecute their war against [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=356.28s)]
*  an organization that embeds their assets in and around and below civilian populations, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=361.92s)]
*  has been, has expanded their target sets clearly with respect to civilian targets. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=366.36s)]
*  I've never been a part of that kind of organization. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=374.88s)]
*  But the one thing that rings true about all negotiations, Chris, is deals happen when [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=378.0s)]
*  both parties are in a hurry, when there is urgency. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=384.36s)]
*  And I still believe that Hamas needs a deal in order to reset and to free itself from [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=389.44s)]
*  the pressures that it's under. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=396.28s)]
*  And I think Benjamin Netanyahu, emboldened by recent Israeli military activities, about [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=398.64s)]
*  to enter into a relationship with a president who is far more inclined, I think, to accept [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=404.32s)]
*  Israeli arguments on this particular question, I think Netanyahu actually has more capacity [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=413.44s)]
*  to accept a deal than ever before. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=420.16s)]
*  But as you get to the end, the end state, the positions of the two parties necessarily [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  harden as each understands the difficulty of explaining to their constituents the concessions [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  that they're about to make and whether or not the deal, frankly, was worthwhile. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  A very hard reality check. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  Erin David Miller, always good to have you on the program. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=444.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OlvfQHrJ8&t=447.0s)]
