# 'Direct violation of the Constitution': Sen. Van Hollen on legality of Trump's Iran strikes
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk)
*  Joining us now is Democratic senator from Maryland and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee Chris Van Hollen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator good to have you here several of your hill colleagues are voicing concern that the president bypassed congressional approval with these strikes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=5.82s)]
*  But is there anything you can do as a body about that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=12.96s)]
*  Well on it's good to be with you, it's not just bypassing congressional approval and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=18.92s)]
*  Notification this was a direct violation of the Constitution [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=24.32s)]
*  Which is you just discussed provides Congress the power to declare war and when you take offensive action and drop bombs on another country [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=28.56s)]
*  That's clearly an act of war. So what we are going to do this week in the Senate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=36.92s)]
*  I'm not sure about the house is take up and vote on the war powers resolution that senator Kane [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=41.48s)]
*  Has introduced and that will be a moment for every member of the Senate to decide whether they want to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=48.08s)]
*  Surrender their authority under the Constitution and just give a blank check to the president United States [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=55.78s)]
*  I hope people reflect on this and I hope we support this war powers resolution. Let me ask you if you think this was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  Unconstitutional Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has suggested this could be an impeachable offense. Do you agree? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=69.58s)]
*  Well, it is a violation of the Constitution as to what the best remedy is at this point [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=77.42s)]
*  My view is that it's proceeding with the war powers resolution and trying to muster a bipartisan [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=82.3s)]
*  Support for requiring the president to come to Congress if he wants to take any kind of further [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=89.3s)]
*  Offensive action. I mean the president recently suggested that his aim was really regime change [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=96.58s)]
*  I mean that would require obviously full engagement of the US military as we saw in Iraq [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=102.9s)]
*  So I think that the best focus right now on us should be on the war powers resolution [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=109.72s)]
*  You posted on X that Trump has endangered American lives and risks unleashing dangerous forces that we can't control [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=114.6s)]
*  We know the US has several military bases and embassies throughout the region [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=120.8s)]
*  There's something like 40,000 military personnel in the region [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=124.76s)]
*  How concerned are you about their safety now? And what do you think should be done to protect them? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm very concerned because I think it's highly likely Iran will respond in some way [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=133.2s)]
*  They've indicated that exactly what foreign that takes that we don't know [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=139.2s)]
*  But it clearly could endanger our forces in the region and Americans around the world [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  And again, you know, the question is why and it was very revealing that yesterday's secretary Rubio [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=149.2s)]
*  Essentially ignored the intelligence that has been provided by the US intelligence community [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=156.0s)]
*  That says that Iran has not decided to proceed to acquire and build a nuclear weapon [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  He said forget about the intelligence. Well, that's what happened in Iraq, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=167.2s)]
*  It was all about weapons of mass destruction. We went into Iraq under false pretenses here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=172.4s)]
*  There was time for diplomacy and instead on what the president did was put a stop to the war [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=178.0s)]
*  And what the president did was put Americans at risk rather than go down the path of negotiation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=184.16s)]
*  To see if we could accomplish our goals in that manner [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=191.16s)]
*  We have reporting that Iran warned the Trump administration of a sleeper cell attack that that they could carry out [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=194.76s)]
*  If the US attacked now that the US has attacked one, what do you make of that threat? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=200.96s)]
*  And two, how confident are you in the US ability to thwart any potential terrorist attack? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=205.0s)]
*  Especially given the diminishment of of intelligence personnel whether through resignations or or job cuts [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=211.52s)]
*  As well as the you know, realignment of some of that that entity toward immigration enforcement [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=219.52s)]
*  Well, I am very worried about the attacks from the Trump administration on many in the intelligence community [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=229.52s)]
*  Because what we risk is politicizing the intelligence and we require and to rely on that intelligence to decide [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=237.16s)]
*  Exactly what kind of threats we are going to be facing from Iran including the one you just mentioned [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=244.16s)]
*  But it's really bad news when the president United States throws his own intelligence community [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=249.16s)]
*  And assessment under the bus. It's not just Tulsi Gabbard. She was expressing the views of the intelligence community [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  It reminds me in his first term about how you know, President Trump said he trusted Putin's intelligence over American intelligence [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=263.56s)]
*  When you go down that road you endanger American lives [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=270.56s)]
*  You [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdEZTxkcOk&t=293.16s)]
