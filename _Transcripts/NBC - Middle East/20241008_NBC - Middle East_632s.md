# ‘Closer than ever’ to a ‘major, multi-front regional war’: Fmr. Arab-Israeli negotiator
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs)
*  Joining me now from Beirut, NBC's chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel and Aaron David [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=0.0s)]
*  Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former Middle [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=4.72s)]
*  East adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of state, where he helped formulate [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=9.16s)]
*  U.S. policy and negotiate, of course, between Israel and the Palestinians when those negotiations [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=13.76s)]
*  actually took place. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=19.46s)]
*  Richard first. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=21.0s)]
*  As you know, Netanyahu was speaking at the U.N. when Hezbollah's leader, Nasrallah, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=22.0s)]
*  was assassinated. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=26.72s)]
*  Israel's defense minister will be here in D.C. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu even had a photo op, releasing later, you know, pictures of him ordering the strike [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  against Hezbollah from New York City. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=39.16s)]
*  So Israel could retaliate against Iran tomorrow while the defense minister is here, according [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=41.64s)]
*  to all of our reporting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  And we don't know very much about the targets. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=48.64s)]
*  We believe, according to my sources, that it won't be nuclear, but there could be ballistic [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=51.08s)]
*  missile sites and air defenses, other things that are close to some of the nuclear sites. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  What are you expecting? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  So well, I think it's it's very telling that the U.S. officials are telling you that they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  haven't been briefed by Israel, even at this stage of the game. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=70.16s)]
*  The U.S. military, the Israeli military work incredibly close together. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=73.64s)]
*  The CENTCOM chief, according to Israeli media, was just in Israel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=77.32s)]
*  The fact that they haven't been briefed either indicates that they don't know. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  They haven't fully decided yet what the targets are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Or there is this concern, and it seems like you're heading there in your own open, that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=88.72s)]
*  the Israelis don't really the Americans don't really trust the Netanyahu government on this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=94.04s)]
*  They don't really trust Benjamin Netanyahu to be honest, that he might do this attack [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  on Iran while his own defense minister is is in the United States, while these consultations [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  are taking place. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=112.84s)]
*  It would be an act of extremely bad faith. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=114.12s)]
*  And just a short while ago, if you saw those comments from National Security Adviser Jake [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=116.96s)]
*  Sullivan, he said, we want full transparency because what Israel does has an impact on [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=120.6s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=126.96s)]
*  If Israel, for example, hits oil facilities in Iran, it's just an article that dropped [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=127.96s)]
*  a few minutes ago in The Economist saying that oil could go up to one hundred dollars [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=132.38s)]
*  a barrel in an election season weeks before the election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=135.8s)]
*  If oil prices suddenly go up that much, it certainly has an impact. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=138.76s)]
*  Andrew, before you go on, let me just while the call to prayer is happening here, I spoke [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=143.0s)]
*  to you about a week ago from this very square. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=147.52s)]
*  And just just then people were starting to come out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=149.96s)]
*  People were starting to come out into the streets because of the Israeli airstrikes [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=154.24s)]
*  in in Beirut. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=157.88s)]
*  Now everywhere you go in this city on the street corners, there are families now because [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=159.4s)]
*  where Israel is hitting here in Beirut is is mostly confined to one area. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  It's called Dahye and it is the Hezbollah stronghold in the city. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=169.56s)]
*  But it is also the most crowded neighborhood in Beirut. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  So mostly everyone from Dahye is now living like these families just out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=176.84s)]
*  No shade. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  They have no food. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  They've been complaining that no one is taking care of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  Frustration is going and they don't growing and they don't know how long they're going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  to be like this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  So while the U.S. is looking for clarity, I can tell you the same thing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  And these same questions are being asked here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=196.72s)]
*  What is going to happen next? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=199.32s)]
*  Where is this all going? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  And what Israel's actions do against Iran will be felt here and in the United States. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=201.76s)]
*  Well, Richard, let me just share with you while you've been speaking. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=207.32s)]
*  Netanyahu has shared with the Lebanese people a message that the Hezbollah confirming that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  the Hezbollah successor to Nasrallah was killed in that strike in that neighborhood you were [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=215.88s)]
*  just speaking of that quarter of Beirut, quoting, We have damaged Hezbollah's capabilities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=221.44s)]
*  We have eliminated thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, Nasrallah's successor, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=226.84s)]
*  Hashem Safi al-Din, and the successor of Nasrallah's successor today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=231.24s)]
*  Hezbollah is weaker than it has been in many years. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=235.72s)]
*  That might be a declaration of mission accomplished, maybe. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  And as you reported this morning, there is an indication, a hint from Hezbollah that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=242.6s)]
*  they might be considering a ceasefire not linked to having a ceasefire in Gaza, which [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=247.44s)]
*  was the previous precondition, which is certainly not happening. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=253.4s)]
*  So we're reading the tea leaves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=259.72s)]
*  But yes, there was. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=261.48s)]
*  So for many, many years, since 1992, you had Hezbollah led by Hassan Nasrallah, charismatic [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=262.48s)]
*  leader. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=270.4s)]
*  He made the group what it was, incredibly organized, well-armed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=271.4s)]
*  He was killed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=276.4s)]
*  carried out the assassination in Dahye after Hezbollah's communication systems was already [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=279.0s)]
*  compromised after having booby-trapped the beepers, blown up the walkie-talkies. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=284.88s)]
*  Then there was this attack on Hashem Safi al-Din, who was Nasrallah's appointed successor, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=289.28s)]
*  a member of his family. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=294.04s)]
*  Now the third in command is the deputy, and he gave a speech earlier today that sounded [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=295.84s)]
*  a lot more diplomatic. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=303.32s)]
*  He didn't say, we are ready, we're done, we're changing our organization forever. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=305.32s)]
*  But he spoke in a way that gave hints that he would be open to a potential. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  He encouraged the negotiation process, encouraged the ceasefire process. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  He did talk about Gaza, but he didn't explicitly link in so many words using the same formulation [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=319.88s)]
*  that Nasrallah had used in the past. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=325.9s)]
*  So that potentially could be an opening here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  But no sense that this is game over yet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  But if Netanyahu is starting to talk in a way that sounds like they've done what they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=333.68s)]
*  needed to do, he, Hezbollah speaking, in a way that's suggesting more compromise, perhaps [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=339.12s)]
*  there is room for compromise and negotiation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, there's certainly a lot of pressure from the U.S. to stop that they've done enough, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=348.24s)]
*  and pressure from the Saudis, who are more interested in containing what's happening [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  in Lebanon, the aggression, the offense there, the fighting both ways, than worrying about [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=357.16s)]
*  what's going to happen in Iran. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=363.68s)]
*  To them, Lebanon is where it, where this could explode. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=366.32s)]
*  We're going to have to leave it there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=369.96s)]
*  They do not want to see another Gaza here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=371.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=372.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=373.84s)]
*  Thank you, Richard. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=374.84s)]
*  Extraordinary seeing those people out on the street. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=379.0s)]
*  Aaron David Miller, pick it up from there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=380.0s)]
*  We have Netanyahu now saying that Nasrallah's successor has been successfully assassinated. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  They have eliminated so many of the weapons that they said were being hidden in homes, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=390.44s)]
*  in tunnels along the southern border. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=396.2s)]
*  Is it possible that they are getting close to finishing the job that they set out for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=399.16s)]
*  themselves in Lebanon, and we could avoid further expansion? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=404.0s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=409.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Andrea. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=410.04s)]
*  You know, 150,000 and 200,000 high-trajectory weapons, the Israelis and Americans saw an [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=411.04s)]
*  assessment, believe that the Israelis have eliminated 50 percent of those. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  But look, Haifa was just rocketed with 105, that's what, 40 miles from the border. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  So clearly, Hezbollah has capacity to continue. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=426.76s)]
*  Obviously, they've taken an enormous beating. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  But look, a ceasefire occurs, whether in Gaza or in Lebanon, when two parties are in a hurry, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  when in fact there is real urgency. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=440.44s)]
*  That's when parties reach an agreement. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not persuaded yet, certainly not between Iyaches and Waar, the preeminent Palestinian [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=445.32s)]
*  decision-maker in Gaza, and Benjamin Netanyahu, that there's any urgency to close on a ceasefire [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=451.11999999999995s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=455.88s)]
*  And I'm not sure we're at the point yet where we're talking about a sustainable ceasefire [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=456.88s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  We're on the cusp of something the Middle East has never seen before, which is a possibility. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not predicting we're going there, but it is certainly closer than ever of a major [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  multi-front regional war, not with the deployment of ground forces, but with AI, with cyber, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=473.76s)]
*  with one-way attack drones, with ballistic missiles, with cruise missiles, with potential [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=480.44s)]
*  attacks on economic infrastructure and even attacks on Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=485.52s)]
*  That we believe, at least, is one thing that is off the table for now in this first strike. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  But if you get into a tit for tat and then there's an Iran response and then Israel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=499.12s)]
*  response, this could escalate very quickly to exactly what you're talking about. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  What happens to 101 hostages in this context? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=508.32s)]
*  Let's talk about the hostages and the Americans. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=512.4s)]
*  In the end, the tragedy of October 7 lies in the massacre, the sexual predation of Israeli [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=516.4s)]
*  civilians, the taking of hostages, and of course the Israeli response, the exponential [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=525.76s)]
*  rise in Palestinian deaths, mostly civilians. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=530.6s)]
*  The hostages are emblematic, I think, of another dimension of the tragedy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=534.08s)]
*  Governing is about choosing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=540.84s)]
*  The redemption of Israelis left on the battlefield, dead and alive, has always been a preeminent [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=542.48s)]
*  Israeli mission. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=550.24s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu himself, as you know, Andrei, in 2011, presided over one of the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=551.88s)]
*  largest asymmetrical trades. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=557.32s)]
*  One Israeli corporal, Gilad Shalit, taken by Hamas in 2006. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=560.76s)]
*  Five years later, Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to the release of 1,076 Palestinians, including, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=565.4s)]
*  as you know, Yahya Sinwar. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=575.64s)]
*  The architect of the Hamas terror surge on October 7. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=578.32s)]
*  So clearly, this is a willful decision on the part of the prime minister to prioritize [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=581.6s)]
*  and not make the return of these hostages a priority because it would create huge problems, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=588.76s)]
*  particularly the asymmetrical number of Palestinians who have been charged or convicted of killing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=596.12s)]
*  Israelis on his right-wing extremist coalition. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=601.22s)]
*  And therein lies, I think, the tragedy that has befallen. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=605.0s)]
*  60 out of the 101 may still be alive. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftOyOM2fhs&t=608.04s)]
