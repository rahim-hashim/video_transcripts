# ‘American imperialism’: Trump says ‘we’ll own’ Gaza, using terms 'like a real estate developer’
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0)
*  There are days and nights in this business when you have to leave open the possibility [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=0.0s)]
*  that you can still be surprised, I might even say stunned. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=7.44s)]
*  I think this is one of those days. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=11.16s)]
*  Donald Trump making news in the biggest possible way. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to read you the quotes that I think are stunning to just about everyone who heard [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  them today after a day of calling for the people of Gaza, who he numbered at 1.8 million, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  to be relocated out of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=29.32s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump said the following about the Palestinian people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=32.08s)]
*  They can instead occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety, and they can live [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=35.52s)]
*  out their lives in peace and harmony. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=39.58s)]
*  Instead of having to go back and do it again, the U.S., the U.S. will take over the Gaza [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=41.88s)]
*  Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=46.6s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=51.04s)]
*  other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=57.12s)]
*  When he was pressed on whether or not he would be willing to use the military to accomplish [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=63.32s)]
*  the U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip, he doubled down on that, said, we will do what's necessary. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=68.42s)]
*  We'll do what's necessary. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=75.24s)]
*  If it's necessary, we'll do that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=76.24s)]
*  We're going to take over the peace, and we're going to develop it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=77.32s)]
*  He referred to the Gaza Strip as the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  He said that world people, world people will live in Gaza, including Palestinians and anyone [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=85.94s)]
*  else, I suppose, that wants to live in this new real estate development he proposed today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=92.98s)]
*  This was stunning, and this came in a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=98.46s)]
*  his first trip to the United States since he was labeled a war criminal by the International [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=104.84s)]
*  Criminal Court with arrest warrants issued. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=111.72s)]
*  This is one of the few countries where Prime Minister Netanyahu can travel because the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=114.66s)]
*  United States does not recognize the authority of the International Criminal Court, which [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=119.5s)]
*  rendered a judgment that genocide and apartheid had taken place inside of Israel, disregarding [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=124.06s)]
*  the war in Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  This was their joint press conference following a bilateral meeting. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=133.26s)]
*  A stunner, a stunner by any definition of the word. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=136.94s)]
*  I'm joined now by Vaughn Hilliard, White House correspondent for NBC News, and Alex Wagner, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=141.38s)]
*  host of Alex Wagner Tonight and also Trump World. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=145.22s)]
*  Trump Land. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=148.9s)]
*  Trump Land. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=149.9s)]
*  I mean Trump Land. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=150.9s)]
*  It's world. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=151.9s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=152.9s)]
*  It's a world. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=153.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=154.9s)]
*  Vaughn, I do want to go to you first because this is a stunner. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=155.9s)]
*  I'm just assuming that there is a lot of reaction right now to what we just heard. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=157.42s)]
*  Official reaction, please, Jared. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=161.98s)]
*  I mean, actually, I've pinged a few people and there's just silence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=162.98s)]
*  I mean, let's be very clear. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=165.22s)]
*  making a passing remark, a seemingly passing remark back in March of Gaza having beautiful [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=167.98s)]
*  waterfront property. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  We have not heard the words of candidate Donald Trump or President Trump suggest the takeover [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  of a land where millions of people call home, the moving them out and the taking over and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=180.82s)]
*  the ownership of the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=186.06s)]
*  And I think that what this represents, I think, cannot be overstated here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=188.1s)]
*  Back in the first Trump administration, there was some semblance of a governing structure [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=193.62s)]
*  in the Trump administration in 2020. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  With the help of Jared Kushner, they did put forward what they called the two state solution [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=200.22000000000003s)]
*  proposal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=204.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=205.58s)]
*  There was going to be two states and yet there was going to have to have Israeli security [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=206.58s)]
*  forces overseeing the Palestinian state. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=212.46s)]
*  Palestinian President Abbas completely rejected it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  OK, but at least it was some sort of a plan or something that was put forward. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  This is not anything of a plan. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=221.5s)]
*  This is a complete American imperialism at its roots, at its core. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=223.46s)]
*  Donald Trump suggesting that this land in the Middle East would be better occupied and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=228.9s)]
*  overseen by America. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=234.58s)]
*  I just don't think we can really begin to even comprehend what we're hearing two weeks [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=235.58s)]
*  in from this administration in terms of the role that the United States is supposed to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=240.9s)]
*  play. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=246.22s)]
*  And even Baby Netanyahu stood next to him and said, I think that the American presidency [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=247.22s)]
*  maybe a different plan than what I do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=250.78s)]
*  But this is it's just remarkable. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=252.78s)]
*  And I don't think this silence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=254.62s)]
*  He seemed stunned as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=256.18s)]
*  I will say that Baby Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu definitely also seemed a bit stunned [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=257.7s)]
*  and taken aback and attempted to respond to it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=261.86s)]
*  Donald Trump also said that he has taken no position on Israeli sovereignty in the West [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=264.38s)]
*  Bank. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=269.86s)]
*  That is also a dramatic change in position from the United States position. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=270.86s)]
*  He also acknowledged that Gaza has been crushed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=274.98s)]
*  He said it's been leveled. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=278.1s)]
*  He's been it's destroyed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=279.46s)]
*  It's a demolition site. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=280.7s)]
*  The sort of stiffness of Baby Netanyahu as he was describing the destruction of Gaza [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=282.5s)]
*  that Baby Netanyahu's president, Prime Minister Netanyahu's own military cause. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=286.7s)]
*  He seemed to acknowledge that complete destruction. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  But his answer all day today has been permanent displacement or at least temporary until they're [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=295.34s)]
*  allowed to move back with the world people of the Palestinian people in Gaza. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  This is actually stunning. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  And to what extent is the U.S. military involved? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=305.9s)]
*  This was a man that ran for president of the United States back in January. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=309.14s)]
*  He said the U.S. shouldn't be involved in the Middle East. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=312.3s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=314.58s)]
*  Alice, let me bring you in here because we know that the trauma induced by the Iraq War [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=315.58s)]
*  and the U.S. presence in the Middle East on top of 20 years in Afghanistan has been significant. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  And it was also a significant reason that Barack Obama was a popular politician who [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=328.3s)]
*  could be president. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=333.22s)]
*  And it also has been a big selling point for Donald Trump. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=334.26s)]
*  He denied he supported the Iraq War. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=336.38s)]
*  What he's now proposing, and I think a lot of people thought of Donald Trump as an isolationist [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=338.73999999999995s)]
*  and wanting to make the U.S. presence in the world smaller. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=342.78s)]
*  We're now talking about potential occupation of the Gaza Strip, which has caused Israel [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  to be at war in Gaza even before January, October 7th, the October 7th attacks. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=353.58s)]
*  We're talking about the United States taking that position of occupation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  With seemingly no consultation with regional partners, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=364.18s)]
*  The suggestion that the Egyptians and the Jordanians should take the Palestinians, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  I can almost guarantee you, given Bibi Netanyahu's expression at this presser today, that that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=371.94s)]
*  possibly hasn't been discussed with those neighboring countries. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=377.54s)]
*  Iran is looking at this, and I cannot imagine what the reaction in the Arab world is. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=380.9s)]
*  The control of the Gaza Strip is the flashpoint for the region. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=386.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is off-roading here, and he has no idea which direction is north. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=389.38s)]
*  And then there's the practical reality, and I hesitate to even venture there because this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=394.73999999999995s)]
*  whole thing seems so, in the words of our friend Rachel Maddow, shambolic and insane. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=398.73999999999995s)]
*  But Pete Hegseth is the defense secretary, and he's going to lead the occupation of American [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=403.78s)]
*  troops in the region. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=408.7s)]
*  And Marco Rubio, who's now also, by the way, taking over USAID, is going to manage the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  diplomacy here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=414.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is when one thought of the catastrophic iterations of Trump 2.0, this is the kind [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=415.73999999999995s)]
*  of stuff that people imagined. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  It is so stunning that it's kind of hard to react to it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=423.46s)]
*  I mean, the idea that the people who live in Gaza, for the most part, came from the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  West Bank, and they are not there willingly. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=431.73999999999995s)]
*  They were there in what in the region is called the Nakba. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  They were pushed out of where they lived in what is now Israel and including in the West [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=437.73999999999995s)]
*  Bank, and they were pushed into Gaza. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  And so they've already—there's a deep trauma that comes from that displacement. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  And so what Donald Trump has proposed is to add to that, remove them to we don't know [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=452.06s)]
*  where. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=457.58s)]
*  We already know a lot of Palestinians already live in Jordan. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=458.58s)]
*  The queen of Jordan, Her Majesty, is Palestinian. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=459.86s)]
*  There's already been displacement. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=463.34s)]
*  He's saying further displacement, but also an American, I guess, permanent occupation [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=464.78s)]
*  and development. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=469.94s)]
*  And this is the thing, and, Vaughn, you know this well. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=470.94s)]
*  In the world of diplomacy, language matters. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=473.78s)]
*  It does. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=475.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=476.82s)]
*  The phrases you use in a press release, in a joint press conference, over the phone with [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=477.82s)]
*  a world leader, those are very parsed. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=480.58s)]
*  They're measured words. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=482.58s)]
*  They're vetted. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=483.58s)]
*  This is the inverse of that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=484.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=486.97999999999996s)]
*  It's, again, it is hard to imagine that this was something that was discussed with great [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  detail and with great consideration within the White House. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  And the implications of it are broad, vast, way beyond the shores of America. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  We also know that from a national security—and I would love to know if you have been texting [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=502.02s)]
*  with—and we've all been on our phones texting with everyone that we could get to respond. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=505.94s)]
*  From a national security perspective, because we know that over the decades, the Palestinian [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=510.58s)]
*  cause and the displacement of the Palestinian people has caused uprisings and caused violence [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=515.3s)]
*  against the United States, terrorism. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=521.06s)]
*  There's a broad, you know, rage throughout the Muslim and Arab world about this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=523.22s)]
*  The Houthi blockade in Yemen is about this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=528.98s)]
*  It's about the Palestinian people. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=533.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=534.42s)]
*  And I think that part of the Hezbollah activity is about an anger and a rage about the Palestinian [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=535.42s)]
*  people and their plight. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  What Donald Trump has said is that he wants to inject the United States in and superimpose [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  us over something that Israel has not been able to contain. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=545.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=549.66s)]
*  We have men—and I think it's important to note we have men and women in real time that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=550.66s)]
*  are in military bases, military installations. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  We have men and women that are in embassies in real time that are undoubtedly watching [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=557.3399999999999s)]
*  this play out. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=560.9s)]
*  And this, of course, this changes the conversations that are taking place in real time, not to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=562.38s)]
*  mention the direct threats that undoubtedly they face on a day out, on a daily basis here. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=567.1s)]
*  I think that the number of questions, knowing that Vice President Vance was sitting there, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=571.74s)]
*  I believe Pete Hegseth was there as well here. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=576.1s)]
*  I just think that this is a moment in time where Republicans on Capitol Hill, right, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=578.54s)]
*  we have seen over the last two weeks, have by and large said the president of the United [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=583.8199999999999s)]
*  States, you know, Americans gave him a mandate. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=587.78s)]
*  This is what they voted for. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=589.98s)]
*  They let the executive branch do its thing. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=591.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is articulating America's foreign policy here in real time in ways that I don't [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  know to what extent they can maybe check. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=599.9s)]
*  Because during his confirmation proceedings, Pete Hegseth was asked directly, would you [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  go through with illegal orders? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=606.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  And he swerved his way around that, and he was confirmed by the Senate. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  The New York Times, I think, aptly Peter Baker characterizing the president's comments today [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=612.5799999999999s)]
*  is him thinking not as a president but as a real estate developer. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=616.36s)]
*  Because the thing he did mention, the only thing where you thought, you know, if you're [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=619.18s)]
*  asking yourself, what's the play here? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=622.38s)]
*  What is he trying to get out of this? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=624.14s)]
*  We were talking about this before the press conference ended. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=625.9799999999999s)]
*  There is a weird obsession in Trump world with development and real estate development [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  and the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=634.54s)]
*  And he did mention several times, you know, we're going to develop it and add thousands [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=636.12s)]
*  of jobs, unlimited jobs and housing. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=641.2399999999999s)]
*  And I'm not saying that there's necessarily going to be Trump Hotel Gaza. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=643.4799999999999s)]
*  But you can see that that is part, at least in the expression of Donald Trump's id that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=646.96s)]
*  comes out in these press conferences. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=652.6600000000001s)]
*  The lexicon that he uses is it's a demolition site. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=653.6600000000001s)]
*  That's a real estate development term. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=656.64s)]
*  It's the Riviera of the Middle East that world people will live there. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  It's going to create thousands of jobs. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=663.96s)]
*  You're right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=665.2800000000001s)]
*  He's speaking about it as a real estate developer. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=666.2800000000001s)]
*  Stunning. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRSCuOqcS0&t=667.76s)]
