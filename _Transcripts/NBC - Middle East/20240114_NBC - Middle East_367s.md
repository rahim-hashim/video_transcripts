# Houthi forces in Yemen vow to respond to U.S. airstrikes
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw)
*  Tensions are rising in the Middle East after the U.S. carried out a second strike against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen last night, with the Navy firing Tomahawk cruise [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  missiles at a Houthi radar site. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=12.38s)]
*  It comes just one day after U.S. and British forces hit more than 60 targets in Yemen in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=14.66s)]
*  response to weeks of Houthi attacks on vital shipping routes in the Red Sea. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=19.92s)]
*  The Houthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=25.0s)]
*  and they are vowing a, quote, strong and effective response to U.S. airstrikes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=30.32s)]
*  Joining me now, Congressman Gregory Meeks, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=36.28s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=41.36s)]
*  Congressman Meeks, as always, thank you very much for coming to the Saturday show. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=42.36s)]
*  With these strikes, do you think the United States is already in a proxy war with Iran? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=46.36s)]
*  No, and thank you for having me, Jonathan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=52.16s)]
*  Look, what we had was the Houthis being warned, as well as his bylaw, and Iran. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=55.36s)]
*  There's no indication that Iran wants to get into a war with the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=63.92s)]
*  But as the president had warned over and over again to Houthis not to get involved, not [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=68.16s)]
*  to escalate anything, otherwise they will feel the cost of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=73.88s)]
*  And we had those 20 or so attacks last Tuesday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=79.76s)]
*  And so therefore, you saw that self-defense, and you saw the United States do and go after [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=86.48s)]
*  with a very limited strike, going after certain targets to prevent them from continuing to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=92.48s)]
*  do and try to disturb the economy of the world, really, for that matter, because that's what [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=98.92s)]
*  they were doing in the Red Sea. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=103.72s)]
*  You know, Congressman, there's been some bipartisan criticism of the president for authorizing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=105.0s)]
*  the strikes without congressional approval. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=109.32s)]
*  Shouldn't he have come to Congress first? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  Were you consulted? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was consulted. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=115.0s)]
*  I was told before the strikes, as well as the chairman and ranking members of all of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  the pertinent committees. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  And as I said, so this is a classic Article II authority that I believe that the president [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  was able and executed on. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=130.0s)]
*  So we were given notice. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=132.0s)]
*  I fully anticipate as we move forward that we will continue to be in contact with the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=133.4s)]
*  administration and learning whatever the long-range plans are, because if in fact there is something [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=139.68s)]
*  that seems to be escalating and it will be long-range, then definitely I think that there [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=144.76s)]
*  is, has to be consultation with the United States Congress and get our approval. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=149.32s)]
*  But there's Article II provisions where we are defending ourselves from the immediate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=154.9s)]
*  attack that took place just last Tuesday in the Red Sea and on commercial, United States [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=159.72s)]
*  commercial ships, as well as some of our allies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=166.8s)]
*  You know, Congressman, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the airstrikes from his hospital [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=171.32s)]
*  bed while receiving treatment for prostate cancer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=175.0s)]
*  Some Republicans are calling for the secretary to be fired for not disclosing his diagnosis [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  sooner. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=184.08s)]
*  Is that a stretch? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=185.08s)]
*  It's all, you know, the Republicans just, that's all they do because they haven't accomplished [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=186.08s)]
*  anything. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  The last segment with my friend and colleague, Yvette Clark, was just that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=192.88s)]
*  What have they done since they've been in the majority? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=197.16s)]
*  Nothing other than taking 16 times to elect a speaker, then getting rid of that speaker, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  then going on, you know, basically shutting the government down. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  And now we're faced with that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=208.88s)]
*  So they're doing and trying to mask and come up with nonsense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=210.48s)]
*  The MAGA Republicans that just hurts the American people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=214.92s)]
*  If you can name one thing that they've done since they've been in the majority, just one, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  as you heard, even themselves on the floor, they've accomplished nothing since they've [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=222.76s)]
*  been given the majority, won the majority in the last election. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=227.6s)]
*  You know, Congressman, let me get you on one more thing before we have to go. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=231.88s)]
*  Taiwan's presidential election, the candidate from Taiwan's anti-China Democratic Progressive [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=235.24s)]
*  Party won. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=240.32s)]
*  So what do you think this means for relations between China, Taiwan and the United States? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=241.84s)]
*  Well, look, number one, I think that democracy happened in Taiwan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the Taiwanese people spoke and they spoke loudly. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=253.28s)]
*  And so we look forward to continuing to work with Taiwan and our ally and do what we need [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=257.72s)]
*  to do in that regard. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=264.24s)]
*  And we continue to talk to the Chinese also. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=266.12s)]
*  They, you know, is troubling some of the things that they've said. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=268.68s)]
*  But we've got to watch them very closely, particularly between now and May, when the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=272.72s)]
*  president would be inducted. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  But, you know, I am also pleased that what took place in San Francisco, for example, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  between President Biden and President Xi, there's some commitments that were made. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  There's more dialogue that has to happen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=291.36s)]
*  So I'm still, you know, as you said, the former chair, ranking member of the Foreign [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=293.8s)]
*  Affairs Committee, where diplomacy is really important. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  And so I want to push forward with the diplomatic exchanges, knowing that we also [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  have the military backup. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=306.56s)]
*  But diplomacy is a dialogue and conversation is tremendously important and will continue [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=307.92s)]
*  in that vein. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=312.72s)]
*  All right, Congressman Gregory Meeks, ranking member of the House Foreign [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=313.88s)]
*  Relations, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Affairs Committee, as always, thank you for coming [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=319.04s)]
*  on the show, especially since I know you have a very special guest who kept you from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=324.28s)]
*  coming in studio with staying at home. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=329.64s)]
*  A granddaughter? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=332.64s)]
*  Granddaughter, my fourth granddaughter. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=334.24s)]
*  I have three daughters, four granddaughters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=336.16s)]
*  I'm a lucky man. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=338.6s)]
*  Congressman Gregory Meeks, hug that granddaughter for me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=341.72s)]
*  Have a good evening. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=344.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86Aq_TjVqw&t=345.8s)]
