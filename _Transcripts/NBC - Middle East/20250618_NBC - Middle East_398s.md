# 'No such thing as one-and-done": Trump risks deeper entanglement in Israel-Iran war
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY)
*  We don't know yet whether the U.S. will get actively involved in Israel's strikes on Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=0.0s)]
*  or more involved, but one major factor could be Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, buried deep [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=5.0s)]
*  inside a mountain. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=10.0s)]
*  I was just mentioning this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=11.0s)]
*  And Israel's ambassador to the U.S. has said that Israel's operation in Iran has to be [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=12.0s)]
*  completed with the elimination of Fordo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=15.92s)]
*  But to do that, experts think Israel might need to use a bomb that only the U.S. is capable [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=18.88s)]
*  of dropping. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=23.12s)]
*  Kelsey Davenport from the Arms Control Association told The Washington Post that Israel can't [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  destroy hardened sites like Fordo without U.S. military assistance. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=28.32s)]
*  These circumstances raise a lot of questions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=32.32s)]
*  Is this just about the one nuclear facility? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=34.92s)]
*  I mean, that's a significant decision, too. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=36.84s)]
*  But is it just about that? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=38.76s)]
*  How did Trump become so receptive to U.S. involvement? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=40.2s)]
*  That's a hard to answer one. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=43.04s)]
*  Most importantly, what comes next? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=44.6s)]
*  And what are all the factors here? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=46.68s)]
*  I have just the person to help answer them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  I've been waiting to talk to him all day. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Joining me now is Jeremy Basch, former chief of staff at the CIA and Department of Defense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=52.04s)]
*  I was just telling you, when I was reading everything over the last 24 hours, I just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=56.6s)]
*  had this list of things that seemed contradictory, that were hard to understand. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=59.84s)]
*  And I'm sure I'm not the only one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  So let me just start with Fordo, because Fordo is 200 kilometers away from Tehran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=65.04s)]
*  It is a huge nuclear facility site, one that Iran has—I mean, Israel has wanted to get [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  rid of for a long time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=75.44s)]
*  Trump also posted Evacuate Tehran when he was saying he was leaving the G7. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=77.88s)]
*  What do you make of all of these pieces? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=83.48s)]
*  One, can Israel do—can they get rid of Fordo without the U.S. military? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=85.44s)]
*  Can they do it remotely without the U.S. military? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=91.32s)]
*  I think the answer is no, but you tell me if you agree with that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  And two, what did you make of the Tehran evacuation call? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Because that's a city of 9 million people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=98.36s)]
*  Well, Israel does not have a bomber force. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=99.88s)]
*  It has an effective fighter force, aircraft that can conduct aerial targeting, but it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=101.64s)]
*  can't actually carry that 30,000 mop, that massive ordnance penetrator, which is the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=107.64s)]
*  only weapon that can go deep into the mountain. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=113.0s)]
*  And what Iran did—and the Obama administration, when it came in in 2009, saw the intelligence [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=115.36s)]
*  that Israel had developed that showed that Iran had buried deep under a mountain a cascade [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=121.36s)]
*  hall to spin centrifuges to develop weapons-grade uranium—that's bomb fuel for a nuclear weapon—deep [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=126.36s)]
*  in a mountain. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  If you're interested in civilian nuclear power, you don't have to build a bunker of a cascade [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  hall. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=139.4s)]
*  And by the way, the cascade hall was small, meaning it wasn't large enough to provide [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=140.4s)]
*  civilian nuclear power. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=144.0s)]
*  It was so small, but it had just enough capacity to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=145.72s)]
*  And so since that time, Israel, the Gulf countries, Europeans, and the United States have been [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=150.28s)]
*  very focused on freezing what Iran is doing at Fordow. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=156.88s)]
*  And all of the diplomatic efforts have frankly been unsuccessful. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=160.68s)]
*  Trump pulled out of the Iran deal that had inspectors on site. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=164.28s)]
*  There were reports that Iran was dispersing some of its capabilities. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=168.36s)]
*  Israel says there's new intelligence saying that Iran is moving more quickly to enrich [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=173.92s)]
*  uranium and develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  And the United States really stands as the only player in the world who could actually [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=181.16s)]
*  take out Fordow. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=184.04s)]
*  So let me ask you, because you've been in these meetings in a variety of capacities, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=185.04s)]
*  from the CIA and DOD, you do planning the day after planning or weeks after, months [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=188.4s)]
*  after planning, to think about if the U.S.—if the military capability of the United States [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=193.92s)]
*  is used just to say—just to take out the nuclear facility in Fordow, what are the impacts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=198.56s)]
*  Iran is going to respond? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  The preparation of attacking troops? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=206.72s)]
*  Is there something on the homeland we should worry about? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  What do you think about? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  There's no such thing as one and done. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  And anytime you brief a military operation to a secretary of defense or commander in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=213.0s)]
*  chief, not only do you talk about risk to the mission, but you also talk about risk [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=217.28s)]
*  to the force. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=221.0s)]
*  So for example, if we were to fly a stealth bomber and try to hit Fordow, if we joined [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=222.16s)]
*  Israel in this campaign, the biggest question would be what happens the next day? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  What happens to our troops in Qatar, in Bahrain, in UAE, on naval vessels in the Persian Arabian Gulf? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=232.88s)]
*  What happens to our allies and partners? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=240.24s)]
*  What happens back to Israel? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=241.76s)]
*  What happens to Jordan? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=243.16s)]
*  What happens to Egypt? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=244.16s)]
*  What happens to UAE and Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=245.16s)]
*  So we have a lot of interest at stake. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  There's no such thing as one and done. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't just fly a weapon into a nuclear facility and say, that's it, that's the end [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=251.72s)]
*  of the nuclear program. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=255.68s)]
*  First, you can't really kill off know-how, so Iran is going to still try to get a nuclear [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=256.68s)]
*  capacity. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=261.8s)]
*  Iran needs to be very vigilant through diplomacy and other means, including deterrence, to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=262.8s)]
*  prevent Iran from continuing to want to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=266.36s)]
*  Let me ask you about some of the other pieces beyond Fordow, because Netanyahu did not take [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=269.24s)]
*  off the table going after trying for a regime change, which would, I mean, they've already [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=273.72s)]
*  taken out some of the leaders there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=278.0s)]
*  Trump also didn't take off the table going after the Ayatollah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=280.24s)]
*  Again, I referenced before, you know, they were, Trump saying evacuate Tehran. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  That is much bigger. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  How do you think about what the implications of that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=290.72s)]
*  We don't know that he's going to do that, but what is the implications of taking, trying [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  to take out the Ayatollah or bombing Tehran? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, I subscribe to the Colin Powell rule, which is the Pottery Barn rule. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  You break it, you buy it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=302.92s)]
*  And I think our lessons in the last 20 years, both in Afghanistan and Iraq, has been when [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  you try to replace the government, the institutions just won't work themselves. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=309.12s)]
*  And so it's very hard for the United States, it's very hard for any country to kind of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  and effectuate any effective regime change. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=318.46s)]
*  So I really think that before there's discussion about regime change, we should be talking [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=321.34s)]
*  very clearly and very resolutely about what are our objectives? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  How do we prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=329.79999999999995s)]
*  And I would put on the table even a policy shift, which is that Iran shall not be allowed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=332.06s)]
*  to enrich on its soil. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=337.0s)]
*  All the other diplomatic deals have allowed for some enrichment and said, you know, you [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=339.82s)]
*  can enrich to low levels. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=343.58s)]
*  I think maybe we have to be tougher and say no enrichment on Iranian soil and then see [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=345.26s)]
*  if Iran takes that deal. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=350.06s)]
*  We only have about less than a minute left. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=351.94s)]
*  But I mean, do you think there's any scenario where a discussion over a deal is even possible [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=353.82s)]
*  right now? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=358.84s)]
*  I mean, Trump's not right now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=359.84s)]
*  Yeah, not right now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=360.84s)]
*  But I do think in the medium term, over the coming weeks and months, we're going to have [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=361.84s)]
*  to talk to the Iranians either directly or indirectly. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=365.26s)]
*  Ultimately, Jen, the only way we're going to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=367.98s)]
*  state is through a diplomatic effort coupled with strong military force. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEwsxuFwXRY&t=372.54s)]
