# Trump turning up heat on Hamas to release all hostages by Saturday
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA)
*  Joining me now, Aaron David Miller, a former Arab Israeli negotiator at the State Department, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=0.0s)]
*  now senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=4.92s)]
*  Aaron David, high stakes and urgent backdrop. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=8.32s)]
*  And President Trump turning up the pressure even more on Jordan and Egypt to take in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=11.56s)]
*  Palestinians who would be displaced if they were relocated from their land in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=15.24s)]
*  How is King Abdullah going to walk this tightrope today when half of his country's population [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=20.12s)]
*  is of Palestinian descent? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=24.68s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan is making a recovery [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=27.12s)]
*  as a consequence of what's happening in Jordan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=32.8s)]
*  So the admission of large numbers of Palestinians and the hundreds of thousands, scores of thousands [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=35.08s)]
*  even is going to strain Jordan's stability. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=40.96s)]
*  Look, I think the king is trying to square an impossible circle. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=43.36s)]
*  A lot of it is up to the president. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=47.28s)]
*  If he follows through on his threat to suspend, restrict or withhold the $1.6 billion that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=49.08s)]
*  the U.S. gives to Jordan, the Jordanians are really have a major problem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=59.76s)]
*  I have a feeling, though, that the king may well find a way to sort of dodge this proverbial [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=65.64s)]
*  bullet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=71.32s)]
*  Reuters is reporting that he's offered to take several thousand Palestinian children [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=72.32s)]
*  and he may up his interest and support for the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  The president isn't going to give this up, though. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=84.12s)]
*  So the real question, I think, is Trump's, because Jordan will not agree under any circumstance [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=86.0s)]
*  to basically resettle on a permanent basis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=93.56s)]
*  Thousands, scores of thousands of Palestinians in Jordan, thereby basically sending a signal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=96.84s)]
*  to the Arab world that the Palestinian problem has now been resolved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=102.72s)]
*  So the president's going to have to demonstrate a little flexibility here not to press the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=107.0s)]
*  king and threaten to cut off aid. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=112.6s)]
*  I think that would be a major, major mistake on the part of the administration. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=115.52s)]
*  And the reporting that you're mentioning there from Reuters seems to have been something [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  they spoke about in the room between the king of Jordan and President Trump, where the king [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=125.32s)]
*  of Jordan effectively said, we can take in 12,000 children and then wait for Egyptians [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=129.64s)]
*  to present plans on other challenges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=134.16s)]
*  So the president is actually pitching the ball over to the Egyptians court when they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=137.56s)]
*  have their own negotiations on this with the president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=141.84s)]
*  But all of this is happening against the backdrop of that tenuous ceasefire and hostage [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  release deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=149.04s)]
*  What do these negotiations, these conversations and frankly, the doubling down by both [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=150.28s)]
*  President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on that Saturday deadline, what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=154.68s)]
*  does it mean for a ceasefire that was already so fragile? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=159.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=162.16s)]
*  You have a Mexican standoff. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  On the 3rd of July, on Saturday, the president has this basically made a statement that if [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=165.56s)]
*  all the hostages aren't released and who cares about the ceasefire, he dismissed it by noon [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=171.08s)]
*  on Saturday. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=177.88s)]
*  So the prime minister appears to have split the difference. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=178.88s)]
*  The fact that 12 o'clock appeared in the prime minister's statement is clearly a direct effort [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=182.2s)]
*  to incorporate at least part of what the president said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=187.36s)]
*  It is not clear to me because I'm not sure it was clear in the statement, which was translated [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=190.72s)]
*  from the Hebrew as to whether or not the prime minister is saying that the remaining hostages [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=196.16s)]
*  in phase one have to be released on Saturday or just three, according to the agreement. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=201.76s)]
*  In any event, you now have a situation where one of the two will have to back down or both. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, we're not going to make it through phase one. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=217.16s)]
*  The ceasefire is going to collapse. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=221.04s)]
*  The surge of humanitarian assistance in Gaza is going to end. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=223.32s)]
*  The release of Palestinians, prisoners is going to end and the Israelis and Hamas will [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=226.72s)]
*  find themselves once again locked into a conflict and a struggle. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  Frankly, neither is going to win. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=236.44s)]
*  And that I think is the end state here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is going to survive in some form, not as an organized military force, but as an [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  insurgency if the Israelis stay able to influence developments, politics in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=246.12s)]
*  So again, the big loser here, without a doubt. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=254.0s)]
*  It's not the government of Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=258.48s)]
*  It's not Hamas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=260.48s)]
*  It's the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza who have been relocated, disrupted three, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=262.02s)]
*  four or five times. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=268.64s)]
*  They are the big losers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=270.4s)]
*  And right now, their future looks pretty bleak. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=271.4s)]
*  Because I think the larger question here for the region as we see what's going on in Washington, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  as one of the epicenters of this negotiation, is the larger concern about destabilization [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=280.12s)]
*  in the region. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=285.24s)]
*  I mean, what are your thoughts there? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=286.24s)]
*  I mean, I think it's true. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, again, I think the president's Gaza gambit in one fell swoop has associated the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  United States with an idea that at best could be described as transfer at worst, according [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=296.76s)]
*  to the Palestinians, as ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  He's undermined both Egypt and Jordan, risked their political stability by demanding that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=306.16s)]
*  they absorb hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  He's validated the fantasies of the Israeli right, who are only too happy with the president's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  pronouncements. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=320.88s)]
*  And frankly, he's sent a very bad signal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=321.88s)]
*  As an American, I would argue a very bad signal to both President Xi of China and Putin of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=324.86s)]
*  Russia, basically saying, well, you give a press conference, you declare you want to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  take over, quote unquote, a piece of territory without any justification. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=337.38s)]
*  By and large, I think this is a untethered, provocative sort of proposal that is only [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=343.98s)]
*  going to pile on the already fraught realities that exist in many states in this region and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=351.06s)]
*  certainly in the corner of the region we're now talking about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iLUKk-DaFA&t=358.06s)]
