# 'Unlivable': Humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsening
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4)
*  What's the situation on the ground right now in Israel? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=0.0s)]
*  Any insight on when Iran could be reacting? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=3.24s)]
*  Well, it's a moving target. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=7.88s)]
*  I think that's the best way to understand it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=11.0s)]
*  There have been several moments, including last night, when it looked like military action, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=14.48s)]
*  some sort of coordinated military action by Iran and Hezbollah was going to come. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=19.68s)]
*  We saw last night Israel go into its highest state of alert and readiness. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=23.76s)]
*  But a week ago, I was hearing from very senior military commanders that they thought it was [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=28.12s)]
*  going to happen at that time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=33.28s)]
*  And I don't think that they were wrong necessarily then or they were misinformed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=35.92s)]
*  Otherwise, the United States wouldn't have sent two aircraft carriers to the Region One [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=40.84s)]
*  being sped up on the way and F-22s and sent the commander of CENTCOM. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=44.96s)]
*  All of this is tremendously expensive. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=50.2s)]
*  They moved because they were acting on intelligence and may have believed that it was coming [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=52.42s)]
*  and it seems that Iran is still trying to calibrate when and where and how to react. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=57.72s)]
*  The new development right now, and this has just changed in the last few hours, and this is only [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=64.28s)]
*  coming from Reuters, but I'm corroborating it through other means. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=69.88s)]
*  Reuters is reporting, citing three sources, that Iran is now holding off on its retaliation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=74.12s)]
*  Could be proven wrong, could come at any moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=80.76s)]
*  The troops are still here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=83.0s)]
*  Israel is still at a state of high alert. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  But the reporting is that Iran is holding off for now because it wants to take part [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=86.36s)]
*  directly in ceasefire negotiations and that it would strike if those ceasefire negotiations [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  to release the hostages and stop the military campaign on Gaza fail or if it is perceived, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=98.2s)]
*  or they perceive, that Israel, specifically Benjamin Netanyahu, is dragging his feet, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=105.88s)]
*  is deliberately trying to avoid a commitment, then they would strike in that case. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=111.56s)]
*  I've spoken to negotiators, one negotiator in particular at a very senior level, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=116.6s)]
*  and he's aware of this, did not deny it, said that he has not received any formal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=121.64s)]
*  application for Iran to take part in the talks, but that he would not oppose it, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=130.04s)]
*  and that we had a discussion with the idea that should Iran have been there perhaps from the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=134.84s)]
*  beginning since it was always a major player. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=140.04s)]
*  So there is still this hanging sword that could drop, but there is also a diplomatic track [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  potentially with Iran getting involved and diplomatic visits from the Biden administration [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=149.24s)]
*  heading to this region over the next several days. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=153.96s)]
*  So there is a lot of moving parts that need to fall into place. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=157.4s)]
*  So we're either going to escalation on one hand or we're going to de-escalation and a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=163.56s)]
*  potential diplomatic route on the other, and really it boils down to what do Hamas want, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=169.4s)]
*  what does Yehia Sinwar want, and what is Prime Minister Netanyahu willing to accept. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=176.12s)]
*  And, Monica, I know you've got some new reporting on efforts to reach that ceasefire deal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=182.84s)]
*  Exactly, Jose. Talking about that diplomatic route that Richard was just referencing, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  we know that CIA Director Bill Burns is expected to be in Doha for what would be critical talks [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  on a potential ceasefire deal that would free some of the hostages still being held by Hamas [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=199.0s)]
*  in Gaza. Those are scheduled for Thursday, but we know given the potential for escalation in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=205.16s)]
*  region, it's possible that some of that could change, though the U.S., the Biden administration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=210.68s)]
*  saying they fully want to pursue these negotiations, and that is why they're sending [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=216.12s)]
*  their top diplomat and negotiator who has been part of all of these different rounds of talks, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=221.08s)]
*  so many different iterations, moments where it seemed like things were close but where the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=226.68s)]
*  final gaps are clearly the most critical to close, and we've been in that position time and time [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=231.8s)]
*  again over the last few months. So that is the plan over the next couple of days, and in addition [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=237.24s)]
*  to the CIA Director, we know that the White House coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=242.36s)]
*  is going to be in the region as well. He was expected to first be in Cairo for some talks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=247.72s)]
*  between Israeli and Egyptian officials there, and then he would also be in Doha later in the week, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=253.08s)]
*  we expect, to come to the table and continue to hash out some of these things. But even the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  U.S. National Security Council yesterday conceded that if there is some major escalation, if we do [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=264.6s)]
*  see that, depending on what happens here, maybe the Thursday talks would have to be moved or affected, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=271.0s)]
*  but it is the priority of the United States that they go on as scheduled, and they're really trying [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=276.92s)]
*  to frame this as a last and best and final offer, even though we've heard that kind of language [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=281.8s)]
*  before, even when the talks have sadly collapsed or gone nowhere. But the U.S., the president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  specifically has been on the phone with allies, with countries like Germany, France, Italy, the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=293.16s)]
*  U.K., to try to talk to those leaders about what's happening there, the current tensions, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=298.52s)]
*  in addition to trying to shore up more support for this potential deal to finally crystallize, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=304.04s)]
*  though there are a lot of obstacles still before that can be done. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=309.24s)]
*  And General, meanwhile, what are the options that Iran has? And the last time they attacked [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=313.24s)]
*  Israel, they did so with hundreds of missiles and drones, etc. What is it that they have in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=319.72s)]
*  their arsenal now that they could utilize? Well, I think you'll see a different picture [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=325.24s)]
*  now. We must remember that not only Hanna Ia was killed in Tehran, but you also had in Hezbollah, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=331.48s)]
*  when you had Shakur also killed the leader and the mastermind behind the soccer field attack. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=342.04s)]
*  There was a retaliatory strike on him, and he was killed as well. If you take a look at Hamas, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  you had Mohammed Diff killed. He was the al-Qasim leader, longtime leader of military forces in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=356.44s)]
*  Hamas. So I think what has changed in this, all we'd be looking to retaliate against Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=364.12s)]
*  And I think the Iranians will use their proxies in this fight. If you go back to the April fight, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=372.36s)]
*  it was primarily an Iranian 300 missiles and drone attack. I think Hezbollah will get involved. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=380.92s)]
*  I think Hamas will try and fire missiles from the Gaza Strip. And we cannot forget about [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=388.2s)]
*  the Houthis down in the south, whether they will act or whether or not the proxies that are located [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=395.24s)]
*  in Syria and Iran, well, they will act as well. And they may act against U.S. forces that are [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=402.12s)]
*  stationed in the region. And that's why it's so critical to set our defensive posture, not only [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=410.36s)]
*  to defend and assist Israel in defending Israel, but also to protect U.S. forces in the region. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=416.92s)]
*  You know, Ambassador Pinkis, Iran has been involved through their different proxies, right, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  in the area for so many years now. And now it seems that, and just listening to what Richard [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=433.48s)]
*  was telling us, Iran wants to insert itself into the diplomatic side of the negotiations, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=439.8s)]
*  et cetera, that would force the rest of the world to deal with Iran as a major player. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  How do you see this part of the kind of the puzzle of what Iran has been doing and what it wants to do? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=451.72s)]
*  Well, there are two levels here, Jose. One is indigenously Iranian, and one has to do with [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=461.64s)]
*  their foreign relations. Indigenously, about their thinking about the cost-effectiveness of any [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=470.36s)]
*  retaliation against Israel. And General Tweedy was absolutely right in describing the scene. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=477.72s)]
*  There are two levels of escalation, what you could do bilaterally, Iran against Israel, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=483.96s)]
*  and how do you use your proxies? Let's not forget that the proxies, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=488.76s)]
*  it's not like a McDonald's franchisee, you know, where the restaurant, one may be in Cincinnati [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=495.32s)]
*  and one in Miami, but they both have the same colors, the same furniture, the same menus. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=501.4s)]
*  These are not exactly franchisees. They operate independently. The second thing that I think [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=506.68s)]
*  constrains Iran, but also is helpful to it, is believe it or not, China. The Chinese have [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=514.04s)]
*  levers of power and influence over Iran. And I think, I don't know this for a fact, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  but I'm connecting dots here, that the U.S. and the Chinese have cooperated, perhaps tacitly, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  not so much directly on de-escalation. Because the Iranians are heavily invested in Iran, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=535.7199999999999s)]
*  Iran sees China as a superpower mentor that sort of equalizes or countervails the U.S., [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=543.8s)]
*  and all this leads to some kind of a recalibration in Iran. And again, like Richard said correctly, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=554.92s)]
*  it could happen in an hour, and everything we just said here is null and void. Nonetheless, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=563.0s)]
*  it looks like there is a serious thinking process going on. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=568.6s)]
*  Interesting. And Richard, meanwhile, as this is all going on, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=571.96s)]
*  is only getting worse. It is being described as unlivable in Gaza. We speak daily to our team in [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=577.64s)]
*  Gaza, our teams in Gaza, different parts of the Gaza Strip, and every time I speak to them, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=588.36s)]
*  I don't know how they can do it, how people can possibly live under the conditions where they are [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=594.6s)]
*  living. It has been now many months. People are moving. Pretty much everyone in Gaza has [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=599.88s)]
*  been displaced from their home at least once, most people multiple times. It is incredibly hot. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=606.2s)]
*  Things are outrageously expensive. There are shortages of everything from food, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=612.2s)]
*  no clean water to speak of. Soap is almost impossible to find. Medicine is almost impossible [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=619.4s)]
*  to find. There is no such thing as a humanitarian zone, really. The humanitarian zone has been [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=626.12s)]
*  struck several times. Israel says because Hamas is taking advantage of it and putting its [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=632.68s)]
*  fighters inside of it. And just recently Israel ordered another partial evacuation of a [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  humanitarian zone. And just to give you an example of a story that we are working on right now, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=644.76s)]
*  there were two babies, two newborn babies, and they were swaddled in their wraps and they had [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=650.76s)]
*  just been brought home and they had been born four days ago. The father went out. He went to go get [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  a birth certificate. While he was out, an Israeli strike hit the house, killed the two babies, and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=665.4s)]
*  his wife and we have an image of him holding the death certificate in an absolute state of despair. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=673.56s)]
*  There are also still hostages in Gaza in this situation being held mostly underground in [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=682.4399999999999s)]
*  tunnels because at this stage probably too difficult to move them around. Israel keeps [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=689.0s)]
*  searching and researching areas. They have been there, many of them since October 7th, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=694.52s)]
*  perhaps not seeing any sunlight, many of them wounded. So across the Gaza Strip for the 2.2 [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=699.96s)]
*  million people for the hostages, it is hard to see how it is survivable for much longer. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEVLKtrcgC4&t=706.9200000000001s)]
