# 'Most fragile moment in modern global security history': Expert on Israel-Iran conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM)
*  Joining us now, NBC's Monica Elba, who's covering the White House for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=0.0s)]
*  Andrew Boreen is executive director of Flashpoint and former senior officer at the U.S. Office [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=4.32s)]
*  of the National Director of National Intelligence. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=8.72s)]
*  And Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration and author [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=12.16s)]
*  of the briefing book on Substack. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=17.16s)]
*  Monica, any word yet on the meeting with the national security team and what he's been [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=19.52s)]
*  putting out there on social media? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=24.76s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, I was just told by a U.S. official that this meeting is scheduled to start this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=26.72s)]
*  hour. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  As of just a couple of minutes ago, it hadn't kicked off yet, but that is something we can [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=32.96s)]
*  expect to take place. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=37.16s)]
*  And if Friday was any indication when the president was last monitoring real time events [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=38.48s)]
*  from there with his top advisors, this could stretch on for several hours. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  It could be a lengthy meeting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=48.16s)]
*  It could be a meeting that takes place, then breaks up for a little bit of time, and then [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=49.36s)]
*  they come back in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=53.32s)]
*  So it's pretty fluid. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=54.32s)]
*  And again, remember, he truncated his travels to Canada to come back to deal with all of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=55.4s)]
*  this in part, he said, and he wanted to be able to do this to have face-to-face conversation [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=60.36s)]
*  as some really potentially consequential decisions are being made here about the involvement [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=65.92s)]
*  of the U.S. in this conflict, which in the last couple of days was at the level of not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=71.84s)]
*  involved except when supplying defense to Israel as it was trying to fend off the missiles [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=76.92s)]
*  and incoming from Iran in the last couple of days, which we've seen, of course, go back [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=83.84s)]
*  and forth. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=88.08s)]
*  So now the real question, Chris, and as the president is sort of hinting at in these social [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=89.08s)]
*  media posts, is we, the U.S., what role we will play and what kind of a decision might [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=93.44s)]
*  be made about using some of these massive bombs that could cripple the Iranians' nuclear [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=99.0s)]
*  capabilities and what they have been developing, though another storyline from today has been [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=105.44s)]
*  just where the truth is on how much, what ability and how soon they could build a nuclear [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=111.2s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  So the president is talking about unconditional surrender. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  He has some really ominous language in his social media posts. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=121.58s)]
*  Remember, yesterday he posted to the 10 million or so citizens of Tehran that they should [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=124.88s)]
*  be prepared to evacuate. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=130.7s)]
*  And then when he was pressed by reporters on what he meant by that message, he said [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=132.7s)]
*  he simply just wants everybody to stay safe. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=136.48s)]
*  So this is a really delicate moment where the president had so far been pushing for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=139.28s)]
*  diplomacy, but there could be more on the horizon. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=143.04s)]
*  Chris. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=145.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=146.84s)]
*  So, Andrew, we know that the president had said repeatedly over the number of months [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=148.04s)]
*  they thought they were close to coming to some sort of deal, which obviously hasn't [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=156.76s)]
*  Monica just mentioned calling on folks to evacuate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=157.76s)]
*  In addition, those social media posts, we are not going to take the supreme leader out, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=161.08s)]
*  at least not for now, and then saying our patience is wearing thin. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=167.12s)]
*  How do you see this moment? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=172.24s)]
*  I think this is probably the most fragile moment in modern global security history. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=175.08s)]
*  Iran has longstanding assessments, and it's almost irrelevant if it's months or hours [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=181.84s)]
*  or days away from an offensive nuclear capability. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=188.28s)]
*  There has been consensus that it is imminent and approaching. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=192.0s)]
*  That assessment has held for several years through different administrations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=195.28s)]
*  I think what prompts that this is now extremely dangerous is Iran is isolated, weakened, and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  backed into a corner. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  In the past, Iran has been in these types of situations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=209.32s)]
*  They resort to cyberattacks. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=212.28s)]
*  And just this week since the last five days have started, we've seen a 700 percent increase [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  in Iranian cyberattacks on Israeli targets. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, those cyberattacks have the potential to spill over into other allied countries' [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=222.36s)]
*  critical infrastructure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=227.44s)]
*  That could create a very dangerous tripwire. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=229.12s)]
*  If they resort to international terrorism, Iran has been the largest state sponsor of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=231.84s)]
*  international terrorism for all of our adult lives since 1979. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=235.12s)]
*  And if that terrorism were to kill an American citizen, a British citizen, a European citizen, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  you start to think, man, does that start to draw in traditional Western allies? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=245.46s)]
*  So I think it's a very, very dangerous moment for the world. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=252.4s)]
*  And I think we all have to kind of wait with bated breath and hope that diplomacy or negotiation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=257.12s)]
*  or that the Iranians come to the table. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=263.32s)]
*  Joel, Israel has pulled off some of the most audacious and successful acts of espionage [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=265.68s)]
*  over the last year or so, the exploding pagers targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, assassinations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=271.4s)]
*  of Axis of Resistance leaders in Tehran and elsewhere. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=277.76s)]
*  Now it's claiming to have total aerial superiority over Iran. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=282.32s)]
*  But how do you convince someone to pull back when they think they're winning a war against [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  an enemy they view as an existential threat? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=291.82s)]
*  Do you agree with Andrew that we are in this fragile and dangerous moment? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, it's great to be with you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  And I do agree with Andrew. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=303.06s)]
*  I think that we're barreling towards bombing Iran. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  I think that this is a tragedy of the president's own making going back to 2018 when he got [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  out of a working nuclear deal that was designed to prevent this exact moment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=315.5s)]
*  So here we are in 2025. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=319.88s)]
*  And to your point, Iran is a threat, a threat to Israel, a direct threat. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=322.82s)]
*  And it has accelerated its nuclear program to points that need to be rolled back because [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=328.32s)]
*  it is posing a near is nearly at capacity to building nuclear weapons and has enough [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=333.22s)]
*  material for nine to 10. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's just the moment we're in. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=340.14000000000004s)]
*  Israel's attacks have gone a significant way towards degrading some of the nuclear infrastructure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  But this is where it gets really dicey because Israel is not able to get rid of all the nuclear [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=353.66s)]
*  And if it is an incomplete set of strikes, it means that Iran will still have the capacity [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=354.74s)]
*  to then quickly advance and move towards building a bomb, which they will say is justified based [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=359.22s)]
*  upon these attacks. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=364.26s)]
*  That's why President Trump is considering what to do right now, because only the United [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=365.86s)]
*  States has the ability to truly militarily terminate Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=369.48s)]
*  It's a coercive diplomacy moment. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=374.46s)]
*  Will Iran pull back and say, we don't need that bombing, we'll eliminate or get rid of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=376.26s)]
*  our enrichment or will they not? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=380.22s)]
*  And I think the president then move forward to this other option. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=382.06s)]
*  Which brings us to the question of whether this situation, Andrew, can be de-escalated, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=385.54s)]
*  right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=389.14s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that resuming nuclear talks with the U.S. could [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=390.14s)]
*  be a kind of escape hatch for the Iranian regime. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=395.1s)]
*  We don't know the full extent of the damage in Iran, but this morning some top intelligence [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=398.38s)]
*  officials, including the CIA director Ratcliffe and D.N.I. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=403.18s)]
*  Gabbard, brief senators on this situation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=406.98s)]
*  I wonder, first of all, what those conversations are like when it comes to assessing the formability [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=410.54s)]
*  of Iran right now, the threat they pose, but also what you think the possibilities are [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=417.14s)]
*  that this could de-escalate. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=421.74s)]
*  You're asking me, yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=424.74s)]
*  Look, first off, I just want to address the fact that I'm not sure that I agree with the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=426.26s)]
*  assessment that only the United States can neutralize Iran's nuclear capacity. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=429.26s)]
*  Yes, we have joint directed aerial munitions. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=434.22s)]
*  Yes, we have all kinds of sophisticated ordinance. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  But so do many other international powers. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=439.74s)]
*  So do several of our European partners. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=443.18s)]
*  So I think that it's not only the United States that can come in and neutralize that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=445.22s)]
*  There are also reports that Mossad and other Israeli defense force entities have potentially [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=450.66s)]
*  mechanisms to do special operations, ground raids, penetrating and then detonating inside, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=457.74s)]
*  for instance, the Fordow facility. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=464.18s)]
*  The Fordow facility is largely what is the core of this conversation that only America [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  can help. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=470.74s)]
*  And I'm not 100 percent certain that that is 100 percent true. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=471.74s)]
*  Now, I will say that those meetings with the DNI, Tulsi Gabbard, with CIA Director Ratcliffe, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=475.62s)]
*  with the president, with the National Security Council, at this point, those are going to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=481.22s)]
*  be conversations at a point-to-point, person-to-person basis. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sTx3dUbhM&t=486.22s)]
