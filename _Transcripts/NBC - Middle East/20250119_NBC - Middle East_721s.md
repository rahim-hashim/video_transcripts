# ‘Hamas is not to be trusted’: Rep. Auchincloss gives his thoughts on the ceasefire
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E)
*  Good afternoon Alex. Thanks for having me on I was struck as I was watching your interview with Roth that that video [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=0.0s)]
*  the three young women being released surrounded by literally hundreds of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  massed armed gunmen [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Hooting and hollering and jeering at them [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=15.56s)]
*  And I think Hamas thinks that that makes them look strong what it actually reveals to the wider world is that they're a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=17.6s)]
*  barbaric terrorist cult that uses sexual violence and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=25.04s)]
*  Torture and terrorism to try to intimidate people what Israel has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Proclaimed over the last 450 days is that it as a country will not be intimidated [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=33.54s)]
*  It is going to achieve peace through strength that strength requires that it defeat Hamas now [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Hamas is a military military [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=45.2s)]
*  Organization I do think has been decimated the harder question is as a political organization has it been marginalized to do that requires [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  That Netanyahu helped architect host war governance and governance in Gaza. That's Palestinian lad. That's Arab finance [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=56.4s)]
*  That's Western backed and that provides security and infrastructure and education to the Palestinian people [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=63.24s)]
*  We await the release of two American hostages. We believe the first will be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=69.4s)]
*  Keith Siegel that will happen on day 14 of the ceasefire and then to be followed soon after [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=75.76s)]
*  36 year old Saghu Dekel Chen [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=82.4s)]
*  And Segal has been injured [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=85.32s)]
*  Do you have any reason to fear that they will not come out as expected? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=88.0s)]
*  I mean the tenuous nature of this we have seen negotiations in the past [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=93.08s)]
*  We have seen them fall apart on on a moment's notice turn on a dime [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=98.92s)]
*  Are you worried about getting these Americans out or do you think they're coming? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=104.12s)]
*  Of course, I'm worried Hamas is not to be trusted. Of course [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=109.16s)]
*  And I'm holding in my heart today Hirsch Goldberg Poland whose family has strong ties to Massachusetts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=114.6s)]
*  that young man had his whole life ahead of him and was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  executed by [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=124.92s)]
*  Hamas terrorists months ago and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=127.08s)]
*  His tragic death [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=130.72s)]
*  I think is a is a reminder to all of us of who exactly we're dealing with across the table people who just have no value [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=132.0s)]
*  On human life. So, of course, I'm worried. I do think that phase one though will happen [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=138.56s)]
*  the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=144.10000000000002s)]
*  Not to be cut is going to be in phase two because phase two has some ambiguity [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=145.22000000000003s)]
*  Embedded within it about the degree to which Hamas is going to have to be [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=150.62s)]
*  Marginalized from the levers of governance before the rest of the hostages come home [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=155.46s)]
*  I am squarely in the camp that says Hamas can have no role in governance post-war [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  And sir, as I mentioned before the break, you're an Afghanistan veteran veteran rather [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=164.94000000000003s)]
*  I'm curious your impressions as Donald Trump will be shortly laying a wreath there at Arlington Cemetery ahead of his inauguration tomorrow [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  What goes through your mind as you see him about to become commander-in-chief once again? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=176.64s)]
*  Arlington National Cemetery is the union's most hallowed ground and it's appropriate that the president-elect visit pay his respect [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=182.76s)]
*  perform a solemn duty of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=190.6s)]
*  Demonstrating to the American public the sacrifices made by our veterans and service members for our way of life [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  I hope this marks an inflection point in Donald Trump's relationship to the armed forces and to veterans previously [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=199.96s)]
*  He has been either dismissive and mocking of them or he has politicized them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=206.76s)]
*  My hope as a member of Congress as a veteran as an American is that this marks a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  New orientation for him to the armed forces and that he approaches them as every single previous commander-in-chief has which is as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=218.12s)]
*  His most sacrosanct responsibility to be commander-in-chief [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=225.84s)]
*  We have to and I don't I don't want it all douse those sentiments and we're all hopeful that things will perhaps be different [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=230.0s)]
*  In this regard as you've so articulately outlined there [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=237.68s)]
*  But we have to remember what did happen in that very hallowed revered area of section 60 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=240.28s)]
*  when Donald Trump [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  You can you can say he was using it as a photo opportunity [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  He was taken he a photo was taken of him there and you know thumbs up smiling in a very sacred area [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=253.84s)]
*  Do you hope or think believe that kind of tenor is a thing of the past within the next four years? I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=261.64s)]
*  Don't think Donald Trump as a person has changed Alex [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=271.2s)]
*  I think that would be naive what I can hope for is that he is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=274.06s)]
*  using this great transition to become the 47th president of the United States and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=281.74s)]
*  Recognizing that he's not running for office again that at the very least he will set aside his grossest politicization [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=287.22s)]
*  the United States military and try to act like a statesman and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=294.46s)]
*  At least put that veneer in front of the American public because I do think it's important for the institution [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=298.74s)]
*  And for the United States military, okay [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=303.62s)]
*  Courtney QB, please join the conversation right now. I'm curious what specifically we are looking at here [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=306.14s)]
*  I do hope you have a monitor but seeing these stairs [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=311.26s)]
*  Nearly full with people standing by for the president-elect's arrival. Where is that in national or in the National Cemetery and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=314.7s)]
*  What will be done inside that building? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=323.18s)]
*  So this is this is the the tomb of the unknown soldier there's an amphitheater right behind it [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=326.58s)]
*  I'm actually not seeing exactly what he's doing [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=331.02s)]
*  But I suspect even just based off the way that you described it Alex that that's what you're seeing right there as we were [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=333.14s)]
*  Here earlier this morning [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=338.02s)]
*  We saw bus loads and bus loads of supporters brought in and I suspect those are the people who have been lined up early [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=339.18s)]
*  I can tell you that you know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  Some of them were Medal of Honor recipients who we we've recognized and done stories on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=346.94s)]
*  They were lined up and they were here to see president-elect [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump lay the wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier and I have to say [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=355.18s)]
*  Many of the people who we watched come in early. This is a very special place for them [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=359.78s)]
*  They know people who have been buried here people who they served with and so this is a solemn moment for them [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=364.58s)]
*  To see the president-elect lay this wreath and a very solemn moment for the for the country ahead of what's going to be a busy [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=372.06s)]
*  24 or 48 hours absolutely and as I look at the scheduled timeline that is certainly differing from the actual [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  Timeline here. It looks like we're about oh [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  Coming up on 45 minutes running behind and whether it may be in part the reason for it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=388.66s)]
*  but tell me what we do expect this will be the first stop and then there's discussion about a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=393.94s)]
*  Briefing in a display room there, which I presume was in that building. Do you know what that's about Courtney? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=399.38s)]
*  there yeah, there is a there's a sort of a small museum inside that building there and and and frequently [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=405.74s)]
*  VIPs including presidents and president-elects will go in there and and they'll have sort of a tour or see some of the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  Mementos that are inside that building most of them related specifically to the Tomb of the Undoed Soldier and the amphitheater there [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=418.18s)]
*  So I wouldn't be surprised if that's if the president-elect also gets that, you know [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=424.1s)]
*  As we've said it I wouldn't be surprised if he makes a stop by section 60 as well [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=428.18s)]
*  And then he has other public events still on his schedule for here today here in DC [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=432.94s)]
*  Including a rally at Capital One Arena. We're expecting that later on today and I have to say we've seen [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=437.62s)]
*  Supporters also lining the the street behind me Memorial Avenue [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=443.42s)]
*  With flags and make America great again hats and shirts. So I suspect we'll see that throughout DC today [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=447.46s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned Capital One Arena, which is where our colleague Vaughn Hilliard has the distinct [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=453.86s)]
*  Advantage of being indoors there as opposed to you. So I do appreciate you being outside for us [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=459.74s)]
*  Congressman as I bring you back in the conversation as well. Have you been into that area that Courtney was describing this display room? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=464.9s)]
*  Do you know what articles of interest and historical significance are there? I [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=471.46s)]
*  Don't I [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=477.09999999999997s)]
*  imagine that there is some [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=479.18s)]
*  explanation of the the site's history, which of course is that it was a the mansion owned by Robert E Lee the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=481.97999999999996s)]
*  Civil War general for the Confederacy and that's really how Arlington National Cemetery came to be is that the Union Army [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=488.74s)]
*  reclaimed Robert E Lee's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=496.74s)]
*  plantation and turned it into [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=499.17999999999995s)]
*  a burial ground for Union soldiers and that is its inception as the Union's most hallowed ground [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=501.46s)]
*  It's a fitting backstory [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=507.7s)]
*  For president-elect to learn from as he takes over the helm of a nation that is deeply divided [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=510.46s)]
*  What what is it like as a veteran to go to? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=516.54s)]
*  Arlington National Cemetery and see the dignity the respect the tradition that is embodied there [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=520.54s)]
*  For its goodness it we're coming on almost 200 years in another couple decades of its existence [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=528.1s)]
*  Well it it frames the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=539.26s)]
*  The great and incalculable [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=544.98s)]
*  Sacrifice that our veterans and service members have given so that we can live in the greatest nation in the history of the world [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=549.86s)]
*  from the war of independence through the Civil War through World War two [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=557.18s)]
*  this nation has been defined by its victories in [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=563.1s)]
*  consequential wars and they have cost tremendous blood and suffering and by [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=567.8199999999999s)]
*  Acknowledging and paying respects for that suffering [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=573.18s)]
*  I think it makes clear the challenge and the duty ahead of all of us us who take an oath to support and defend the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=575.9s)]
*  Constitution of the United States it's it's not an oath that has simply been signed with ink [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=582.98s)]
*  It's an oath that has been paid for with blood. Mm-hmm on this particular [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=588.38s)]
*  Camera angle ever and we are seeing Pete Hegseth. He is there in the lower left part of your screen [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=594.14s)]
*  It looks like he is flanked by his wife [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=600.34s)]
*  Of course congressman that is Donald Trump's pick to be Secretary of Defense now that camera has just centered him up there [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=601.94s)]
*  He looks very quiet he's staring straight ahead he doesn't seem to be conversing with people around him [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGxqdhnh4E&t=608.38s)]
