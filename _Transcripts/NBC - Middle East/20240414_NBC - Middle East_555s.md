# House GOP is focused on 'woke culture war' instead of bipartisan national security bill
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY)
*  How much warning did Israel have of a possible attack from Iran? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, two congressional officials tell NBC News that members of the House and Senate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=5.96s)]
*  intelligence committees, they received classified information last week on Iran's plans to strike [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=10.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jason Krove, Colorado. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=16.2s)]
*  He is a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=19.34s)]
*  Good to have you with us this morning, Congressman. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=22.6s)]
*  If you could just give us a sense of how the members that you've spoken to, what you're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=26.16s)]
*  hearing about what happened last night, where the administration is currently positioned [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=32.72s)]
*  in basically telling Netanyahu, take the win. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  Okay, no more escalation here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  How are you seeing this, and particularly how does this now level up the conversation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=45.4s)]
*  on funding, not just for Israel, but Ukraine? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=50.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly, you know, we have pretty good visibility into what Iran is doing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=55.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't say that this was necessarily a surprise. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=59.92s)]
*  And they were forecasting some of this too, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  I think this goes into their risk calculation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  And there's a really big question in my mind as to whether or not they wanted this forecasted [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=67.84s)]
*  because they wanted some of these missiles to be intercepted as a way to assess their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=71.96s)]
*  risk and mitigate their risk. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=76.94s)]
*  So right now, you know, I haven't received a classified briefing yet since this has happened. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=78.4s)]
*  So when we go back into session on Monday, the Intelligence Committee will receive those [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=83.04s)]
*  briefings and there's a lot of questions in a lot of our mind. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  I think one of the biggest questions that we're all asking ourselves is, has Iran's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  risk calculation vis-a-vis Israel in regional conflict changed? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Right, because they're very good at using proxies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=99.48s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  They are very good at going right up to the line, but avoiding a broader Middle East conflict. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=103.88s)]
*  This was a direct attack by Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=109.64s)]
*  This is different. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=110.8s)]
*  This is a direct attack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=111.8s)]
*  It's quantitatively and qualitatively different. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=113.16s)]
*  The number of missiles is something we haven't seen before, the drones, and the fact that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=115.8s)]
*  it came directly from Iran. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=120.8s)]
*  So the question a lot of us are asking is, are they now looking for a broader Middle [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=122.12s)]
*  East conflict, whereas they weren't before? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, to that question, I think there are a lot of Americans today waking up, Representative [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=129.4s)]
*  Crowe, who they may have interest in the region, they may have family in the region, they may [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=134.76s)]
*  be invested for the reason. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=138.68s)]
*  And then there are others who are just asking, am I, as an American, less safe than I was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=139.68s)]
*  15, 16 hours ago? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=143.76s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=146.48s)]
*  Well, I would say no. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=147.48s)]
*  Number one, the United States is standing by Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=150.16s)]
*  We surged resources into the region days ago, actually over a week ago. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=153.48s)]
*  President Biden, the National Security Council, Defense Secretary Austin, they are tremendous [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=160.0s)]
*  national security leaders, very experienced in these issues. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=165.28s)]
*  They are doing exactly the right things in responding to this, putting defensive measures [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=168.8s)]
*  into place. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=173.28s)]
*  The risk has been very high for months now, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=174.64s)]
*  The fact that this attack has happened doesn't mean there hasn't been substantial risk. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=177.64s)]
*  And many of us who have been paying attention to this know that the risk is higher, certainly [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=182.64s)]
*  in my lifetime, of a broader Middle East war than it's been in a very, very long time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  So this is a delicate situation, and this underscores the importance of having great [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  leadership in the White House, great leadership in the CIA and the Defense Department and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=196.54s)]
*  the State Department, which we certainly do right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  Congressman, last week, when you all left town, this week's legislative calendar included [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=205.0s)]
*  things like refrigerators and just very important legislation, I guess, that relates to appliances [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=210.72s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=217.12s)]
*  We now know from Congressman Steve Scalise that that is shifting, and the conversation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=218.66s)]
*  about aid to Israel specifically is on the table for next week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=224.9s)]
*  I want to play for you what John Kirby had to say about Congress and aid. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  This morning on Meet the Press, just a little bit ago. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=232.88s)]
*  You and I both know the votes are there, but we're just looking for leadership out of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=235.88s)]
*  Speaker's office. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=240.52s)]
*  We're looking for leadership out of the Speaker's office. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=241.52s)]
*  We had Congressman Meeks on earlier this morning, who noted the only aid package, there's one [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=245.24s)]
*  bill that he would support, and that is the bill that was passed in the Senate in February [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=250.96s)]
*  that had aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian aid for Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Is that the only aid package you two would support when it comes to the aid that is much [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=260.32s)]
*  now needed for our ally Israel, but also Ukraine? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=265.52s)]
*  Well, I want to go to your original point about the original legislative agenda for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=269.36s)]
*  this week, which was the best of the best for House Republicans' woke culture war agenda. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=273.64s)]
*  They continue to focus on things to try to roll back important life and safety regulations [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=280.68s)]
*  on appliances. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=287.04s)]
*  This is stuff that is absurd. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=288.84s)]
*  They try to make a big deal about these issues that are not on the front of mind of Americans [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=292.44s)]
*  gas stoves, you know, refrigerators, safety regulations, rolling this up back. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=298.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have substantial national security issues facing the country from Ukraine to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Taiwan to Israel. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=308.96s)]
*  That's what we continue to be focused on. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=311.36s)]
*  The Senate passed, overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan national security bill. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=312.92s)]
*  We can take that up tomorrow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=317.6s)]
*  We could pass it tomorrow. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=319.2s)]
*  Overwhelmingly, they still refuse to do that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=320.88s)]
*  That is what this is about. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=323.68s)]
*  We need to move a bill. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  We need to move it now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=327.56s)]
*  These conflicts are all tied to one another. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=328.44s)]
*  We see Iran, North Korea, China, Russia. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=330.64s)]
*  They are all coordinating. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=334.28s)]
*  They are now working together. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=336.0s)]
*  We need a comprehensive national security bill. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=337.56s)]
*  We have one in the Senate bill. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=339.88s)]
*  Let's get it done. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that's the frustration for a lot of folks that, you know, you have these these [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  great events that are all converging together. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, you've got the ongoing narrative between Russia, Ukraine. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=352.12s)]
*  You've got Israel and Palestine. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=356.12s)]
*  Now you've got Israel, Iran. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=358.48s)]
*  And you've got a Congress that is sitting there, as Simone rightly noted, worried about [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=360.32s)]
*  gas stoves and appliances. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=366.44s)]
*  How do Democrats at this point level up the conversation and leverage against those storylines [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=369.16s)]
*  and take use the rules of the House? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=378.04s)]
*  The rules that are available to push back on this level of inability to move on these [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=382.84s)]
*  big issues, because you have, particularly with the Ukrainians and the Palestinian people, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  two communities that are suffering desperately and not so much for different reasons. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=398.36s)]
*  I mean, you know, famine and war exact the same cruelty. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=405.4s)]
*  And so the reality that the Congress has right now to step in and do something, is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=409.8s)]
*  there anything Democrat leaders, Democratic leaders in the House can do using the rules [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=415.32s)]
*  against this sort of slow roll by Republicans? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=422.04s)]
*  Well, there's two issues going on here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  One is our need to continue to communicate to America, right, to tell the story. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=427.48s)]
*  And we have a great story to tell. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=432.44s)]
*  Last Congress, also with a very narrow majority, Democrats were in control of the House. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=434.04s)]
*  President Biden in the White House. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=439.88s)]
*  We were the most legislatively successful Congress in generations. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=442.36s)]
*  Not since the Great Society legislations of Lyndon Johnson have we passed more [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=446.36s)]
*  transformative legislation from veterans to national security, the climate crisis, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=450.04s)]
*  to health care. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  We did that with a very narrow majority and then contrast that with right now, one of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=456.04s)]
*  the least productive Congresses in American history. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=461.16s)]
*  So continuing to tell that story, continuing to tell the fact that the Democratic Party [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=464.04s)]
*  is now the party of national security. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=468.68s)]
*  We are the ones that helped negotiate a bipartisan immigration order security bill that we would [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=470.6s)]
*  have taken up until the former president said, no, don't take it up because we want [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=476.44s)]
*  to campaign on this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=480.92s)]
*  We're the ones that want to continue to push Ukraine, not because that's a charity bill, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=482.12s)]
*  but because that's in U.S. national security and economic interests. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=486.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=489.8s)]
*  This is not charity. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=490.2s)]
*  This is looking out for the American people. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=491.48s)]
*  So we have a great story to tell. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=493.24s)]
*  And there are some legislative procedures that are available to us, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=494.92s)]
*  Because there are some moderate Republicans that understand this, understand this well. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=498.36s)]
*  And that's where I was going to, yes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=502.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=504.2s)]
*  And a lot of those, by the way, are my fellow veterans. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=504.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=506.76s)]
*  I'm very close with my fellow combat veterans in the House. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=507.24s)]
*  And a lot of those folks say, listen, this is a generational moment. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=510.92s)]
*  This is a Churchill moment where we have to step up and do big things. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=514.36s)]
*  And we're talking to those folks about how we move this forward if we need to. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jz01IW9HgY&t=519.8000000000001s)]
