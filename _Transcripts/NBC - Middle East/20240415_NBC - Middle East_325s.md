# Israel will retain our right to defend ourself after Iran's attack, says gov't. spokesperson
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk)
*  But first, we want to discuss the developments over the weekend after Iran launched more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=0.0s)]
*  than 300 missiles and drones toward Israel, marking the first time Iran has directly attacked [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=5.08s)]
*  the Jewish state. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=13.52s)]
*  So joining us now, spokesman for the Israeli government, Avi Hyman. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And sir, Iran calls its attack on your country legitimate and responsible action. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=18.52s)]
*  That they were responding. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=26.6s)]
*  My question to you, sir, is what are the options in terms of a response? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=28.66s)]
*  And can you confirm that there will be a response to this? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=34.74s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on this morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=40.58s)]
*  Let me first say that this narrative of retaliation is actually absurd because I can't speak directly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  to that strike in Damascus. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=50.74s)]
*  What I can say definitively, definitively is that was not an embassy, it was not a consulate, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=53.46s)]
*  it was not a diplomatic mission. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=58.38s)]
*  It was a military target, part of the Al Quds Force, which is obviously Iran's major exporter [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=60.06s)]
*  of terror around the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=67.22s)]
*  So they were there to do Israel harm. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=68.86s)]
*  As far as the response, Israel will retain our right as a sovereign democratic country [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=71.22s)]
*  to defend ourselves after what you said was an unprecedented attack. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  And thank goodness, an unprecedented response. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=81.94s)]
*  Had some of those ballistic missiles, suicide drones or cruise missiles, had more of them [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=85.22s)]
*  landed, there could have been absolute catastrophe in Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=92.1s)]
*  It could have been total carnage. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  So we're thankful and we're thankful to our strategic allies for standing with us on this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=97.14s)]
*  one. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=101.22s)]
*  But it could have ended very, very differently. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=102.9s)]
*  We have the President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haas, with us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=105.42s)]
*  And he has the next question for you, sir. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=109.94s)]
*  Richard? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=112.42s)]
*  Sir, you just referred to the fact that had some of those missiles or drones Iran launched [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=113.42s)]
*  gotten through, it could have caused real damage. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=117.86s)]
*  There's a school of thought, though, here in the United States and elsewhere, that Iran [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=120.34s)]
*  seemed very anxious for this not to escalate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=124.54s)]
*  They were very quick to announce in New York that the whole back and forth had been concluded. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=127.3s)]
*  Do you take that seriously? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=133.1s)]
*  Do you think Iran intended for those missiles to get through? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=134.62s)]
*  Or do you think that they were simply doing what they did in order to say, essentially, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=137.58s)]
*  Israel can't expect to be a sanctuary? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=143.34s)]
*  How seriously do you understand their military attack to be? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=146.06s)]
*  Well, I think this was a very, very serious military attack. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=150.54s)]
*  I'm not sure if there's a precedent for it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  What I can say is that this is a huge country attacking a tiny country, a country Iran has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=157.1s)]
*  been funding its proxies in terror pretty much from the Islamic Revolution, whether [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=164.24s)]
*  it's Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, et cetera. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=173.04s)]
*  Now there was peace. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=177.12s)]
*  There was a form of peace. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=178.96s)]
*  There was a form of ceasefire on October 6th. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=180.12s)]
*  But then Hamas attacked us, raping, killing, burning whole families alive. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=183.08s)]
*  Well, who was pulling the strings if not the tyrants of Tehran? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=187.64s)]
*  So it's not as if they want to paint this picture as if they started, you know, we did [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=190.76s)]
*  something a few weeks ago, they're doing something now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=194.84s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=197.36s)]
*  They started long ago and Iran is pulling all the strings in the Middle East as far [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=198.36s)]
*  as terror is concerned. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=202.4s)]
*  Mr. Hyman, good morning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=204.36s)]
*  President Biden in his phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu over the weekend certainly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  expressed U.S. support for Israel's need to defend itself, but also told the prime minister [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  to quote, take the win. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=214.24s)]
*  And U.S. officials urging their Israeli counterparts to not do something they'd regret. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=216.12s)]
*  Another quote in terms of retaliation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=221.96s)]
*  Do you give us a sense how much is your government going to listen to the Council of the United [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=225.24s)]
*  States and not do a significant escalation here? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  I can't stress the nature of the relationship, of the friendship, of the shared values that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=233.88s)]
*  we have with the American people and with the administration. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  And we thank the administration for everything that they've done for us and continue to do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  for us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=247.24s)]
*  But at the same time, we will have to, as a sovereign state, make the decisions to defend [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=249.88s)]
*  our country in the best possible way. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=255.64s)]
*  Now, in the beginning of the war, we were told, don't rush into Gaza. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=257.56s)]
*  You know, don't go in hotheaded. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=260.28s)]
*  And we didn't. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=262.24s)]
*  We waited it out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=263.24s)]
*  We went in, called, calm and collected. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=264.28s)]
*  And we will, we're currently assessing the situation with Iran and we will act accordingly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=266.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's us that grabbed our toddlers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=271.56s)]
*  It's us that grabbed our babies and ran for cover on Saturday night when 300 missile suicide [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=274.32s)]
*  drones were being blown up over the skies above us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=281.36s)]
*  Israeli government spokesperson Avi Hyman, thank you very much for coming on this morning. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=287.96s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp33QNS0Dvk&t=293.28s)]
