# The importance of the locations of the U.S. military's retaliatory strikes against Iranian proxies
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg)
*  The U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria targeted facilities in Iraq and Syria that the Iranian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=0.0s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Quds Force and affiliated militia use to attack U.S. forces. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=7.84s)]
*  To explain the importance of these locations and what these strikes mean for the region [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=13.24s)]
*  is MSNBC National Security Analyst Clint Watts. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=16.92s)]
*  He's a former FBI special agent, the leader of the Digital Threat Analysis Center at Microsoft, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=19.68s)]
*  and author of Messing with the Enemy Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=25.46s)]
*  Russians and Fake News. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=30.42s)]
*  Clint, what can you tell us about the locations that were hit last night? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=32.42s)]
*  Andrea, just to put this in perspective, right here, that location in black is the Tower [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=37.34s)]
*  22 attack that happened a week ago. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  None of these locations were surprises that we saw last night. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=47.06s)]
*  Dez Ozur, which is right near here, right on the river here, the Euphrates River, heading [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=50.5s)]
*  down into Iraq. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=55.38s)]
*  Several attacks there, several attacks here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=57.42s)]
*  A big attack in Al Qaim. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=59.74s)]
*  Al Qaim is inside Iraq. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=61.42s)]
*  And some other strikes right around in here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=63.92s)]
*  This pattern, though, Andrea, was remarkable for me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=66.26s)]
*  If I rewound back to 2006, 2007 and 2008, these are the same towns that we would see [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=68.86s)]
*  as the foreign fighter trails going through Syria and coming into Iraq. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=73.78s)]
*  And this is still the place where the U.S. military has had combat power deployed in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=78.18s)]
*  the fight against ISIS now for many years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  So this border area, those are the strikes that we've seen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=85.86000000000001s)]
*  And all of those targets are Islamic resistance, Iraq groups. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=88.9s)]
*  These are militia groups that are proxies of Iranian forces. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=93.5s)]
*  I think the big question is, were these military targets just going after the proxies? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  Yes, they were in retaliation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=101.42000000000002s)]
*  Which you were just talking to Jeremy and Colonel Jacobs right before this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=103.58s)]
*  Question is, what were the Iranian targets in that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=108.14s)]
*  That would be the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=110.46s)]
*  They have a unit known as the Quds Force, and they operate basically like a special [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  forces element for Iran, attaching and working with all sorts of forces and resistance groups [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=118.22s)]
*  and proxies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=124.7s)]
*  So the question is, were all the targets hit just these resistance groups, these proxies, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=125.7s)]
*  or were they actually IRGC members there? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=130.3s)]
*  Most people think the IRGC had probably cleared out of town. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=133.02s)]
*  Some still wonder if there were Iranian targets in the midst of these locations as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=136.06s)]
*  Do you think that they were targeting specific people, specific leaders that they know very [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=140.9s)]
*  well from intelligence, or were they going after the facilities, command and control [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=144.34s)]
*  munitions, and assuming that they would get some of the players inside? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=148.66000000000003s)]
*  Andrea, I think it was mostly the latter. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  Based on looking at some of the reports of al-Qaim in Iraq in particular, they were talking [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=158.3s)]
*  about a munitions bunker possibly being struck. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=162.26s)]
*  They saw lots of loud explosions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  Separately, there's a lot of communication nodes between those groups there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  So if they can hit those nodes and hit that ammunition, they're reducing the risk of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=169.48s)]
*  all these strikes that you see here on the map occurring. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=173.48s)]
*  The bigger question, though, is the connective tissue between all of these militia groups [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  is the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  Overnight there are some reports that Israel struck an IRGC commander in Damascus, which [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=184.5s)]
*  here closer to Israel and the Israeli border. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=189.94s)]
*  So there's some question about is this a multi-country effort to go after the IRGC and what might [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=192.7s)]
*  we see next? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=197.62s)]
*  Remember, they have IRGC links to the Houthis down in Yemen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=198.62s)]
*  We see it across Syria and Iraq. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=202.02s)]
*  And we see it with Hezbollah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=204.7s)]
*  That's the key one we've been looking at for many months now since the outbreak of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=206.18s)]
*  war. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=210.34s)]
*  So these are all the questions of would there be a follow-on layer and would that be in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=211.34s)]
*  a different location? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJaEtC4ebg&t=214.14s)]
