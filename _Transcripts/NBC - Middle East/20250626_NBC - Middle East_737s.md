# 'No one' in admin is providing details on Iran's nuclear program actually being destroyed: Kube
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI)
*  Was this tailored to an audience of one, President Trump? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was pretty obvious up there. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=3.6s)]
*  But we did get a little bit more detail about the strikes over the weekend, specifically [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=6.08s)]
*  on Florida. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=10.56s)]
*  That was really what this entire briefing focused on, from the chairman of the Joint [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=11.56s)]
*  Chiefs General, Dan Kaine, including information such as that six of these massive ordnance [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=14.4s)]
*  penetrators were actually targeted on that nuclear facility there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=20.3s)]
*  But, Ana, the big question remains not whether this mission was successful in that it carried [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=25.04s)]
*  out the men and women of the military carried out the mission in the way they were directed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=29.72s)]
*  to do, but whether the U.S. actually has intelligence or evidence that the facility at Fordo and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=33.64s)]
*  that the ones at Netanjsa and Isfahan were destroyed, and not just that, what was destroyed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=41.2s)]
*  as part of those. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Was there any enriched uranium? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=48.32s)]
*  Were there centrifuges that were part of that as well? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=49.68s)]
*  Now, we did hear from Secretary Hegseth about that, the idea that the highly enriched uranium, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=52.36s)]
*  whether it was actually destroyed or not, or whether it was moved, but Ana, he didn't [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=57.92s)]
*  really provide any actual details on it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=61.6s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=63.84s)]
*  Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside the Fordo Mountain [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=67.0s)]
*  or some of it, because there were satellite photos that showed more than a dozen trucks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  there two days in advance? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=77.68s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=79.44s)]
*  Of course, we're watching every single aspect. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=82.2s)]
*  We're looking at all aspects of intelligence. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=85.88s)]
*  were supposed to be, moved or otherwise. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=90.16s)]
*  Now, soon after the briefing was finished, Ana, we had a truth social from President [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=95.6s)]
*  Trump about the same issue, about the idea of whether the enriched uranium or any of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  these components necessary for creating a nuclear weapon were moved. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=103.96s)]
*  The president's saying the cars and small trucks at the site were those of concrete [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=107.44s)]
*  workers trying to cover up the top of the shafts. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=112.0s)]
*  The building was taken out of the facility, would have taken too long, too dangerous, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=115.32s)]
*  very heavy and hard to move. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=118.88s)]
*  He is referring there, Ana, to there were several ventilation shafts. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=120.44s)]
*  There was a point of vulnerability that the U.S. targeted with those bombs, the hope that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=124.96s)]
*  they would go, the bombs would be able to penetrate further down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=130.04s)]
*  Well, those ventilation shafts in recent days were covered by concrete. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  The president and we heard the very first mop, the very first bomb actually took those [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=136.76s)]
*  out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  And they're referring to the ventilation shafts and saying that the trucks that were [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=142.08s)]
*  there were concrete, not addressing, again, the facilities at Natanz and Isfahan where [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  the U.S. also struck Ana. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=150.44s)]
*  And so, Monica, why did they decide to hold this presser just before the classified Senate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=151.44s)]
*  briefing? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=156.4s)]
*  Well, Ana, I think this is about optics and about trying to provide some additional details. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=157.4s)]
*  And we know that there was the new assessment and statement from the CIA director, for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  instance, overnight that did back up a little bit more of what the president was trying [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  to argue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  And he's been relying even on the Iranian officials statement about this, these nuclear [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  sites being badly damaged. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  He's also been citing, of course, the Israeli assessments. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=178.48s)]
*  But this is really about trying to issue a counter narrative from the president and his [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=181.0s)]
*  top officials to what was in that preliminary finding that upset him so much that he was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=185.32s)]
*  very clearly lashing out about yesterday when he was holding that press conference at NATO [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  and that he's been talking about on social media pretty consistently since then. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  This is about the president trying to communicate that and trying to control that narrative, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=199.92s)]
*  I think, in many ways, even though he himself conceded that the intelligence, even if it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  was in its early stages, was accurate at the time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=209.92s)]
*  But that was the idea that it was preliminary and that was going to there was going to be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  a lot more information coming in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=216.27999999999997s)]
*  But this is somebody who is very defensive about his decisions here and specifically [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=218.27999999999997s)]
*  trying to link that to this idea that there's criticism of the military involved in the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  actual strikes, which is not really what people have been raising. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=228.58s)]
*  It's the president making that linkage when really it's just key questions that are raised [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  that even the utmost experts can't answer with any kind of certainty. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=236.86s)]
*  And that also connects to this concept of what may have happened with the enriched uranium, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  whether it was moved or not. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=246.06s)]
*  This is a president who is being completely definitive about things that, frankly, cannot [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=247.34s)]
*  be said with such certainty at this time and may take a long time to figure out, Ana. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=251.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=255.74s)]
*  And so, Richard, President Trump and Secretary Hex are continuing to slam the media for doing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=256.24s)]
*  our jobs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=260.98s)]
*  We're reporting on for asking questions about the intelligence around the Iran attack. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=261.98s)]
*  Here's Senator Mark Warner, vice chair of the Intel Committee, explaining why the administration [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=266.02s)]
*  does need to be pressed on the details. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=270.06s)]
*  Some of this were questions that we're going to have to be asking. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=274.1s)]
*  We intelligence was manipulated and we ended up in a war that I think most Americans wish [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=278.14s)]
*  would have thought twice about. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=286.74s)]
*  We already have an administration that is clearly firing the writer if they don't change [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=289.46s)]
*  their intelligence so it doesn't potentially embarrass the president. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=295.86s)]
*  That is a holy crap kind of danger. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=299.94s)]
*  Richard, this is post-Iraq war. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  This isn't lawmakers and reporters splitting hairs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  It's asking the White House to show their work. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  Did this morning's presentation start that process? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  Lots of things to say. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=315.9s)]
*  Battle damage assessment is always highly subjective. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=320.5s)]
*  I've looked at any number of photographs and it's hard sometimes to know exactly what you're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=324.06s)]
*  looking at. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=329.14s)]
*  The idea that different people would have different interpretations makes perfect sense. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=330.14s)]
*  First of all, you can't destroy what you didn't target. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=335.98s)]
*  I think there are big questions about what was not necessarily located in that facility, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=338.9s)]
*  whether it was moved out recently or it was placed somewhere else years ago. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=344.34s)]
*  I think it's possible one in the same time to say this was an impressive military action. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=351.7s)]
*  It was warranted. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=356.3s)]
*  At the same time, it didn't obliterate or eliminate the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=357.7s)]
*  Elements of it will have survived. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=363.22s)]
*  I think in the years ahead, the United States and Israel may well have to deal with it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=365.18s)]
*  I think the administration is probably doing itself no favors and making the absolute case [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=370.58s)]
*  of what it accomplished. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=375.58s)]
*  Again, I think going forward, it's unlikely that Iran will give up its nuclear program. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=377.06s)]
*  It's unlikely that diplomacy will solve it for us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=382.94s)]
*  It may be that we're called upon once again to act militarily against it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=385.9s)]
*  Courtney, it does seem the White House intel view on Iran's nuclear program appears to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=390.18s)]
*  be coalescing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=394.38s)]
*  Now, tell us about this latest CIA assessment. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=395.38s)]
*  Yeah, both the CIA and the DNI now saying with certainty that they have information [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=397.7s)]
*  that the nuclear program or these nuclear facilities were destroyed. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=402.98s)]
*  But the reality is we've been asking questions, including here today at the Pentagon, about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=407.58s)]
*  what that's based on and whether it's based on U.S. collection, whether it's based on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  allies. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=414.82s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth, as well as President Trump yesterday, reading statements from other nations, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=416.26s)]
*  or are monitoring agencies, including the Israelis, saying that they believe that there [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=422.66s)]
*  was destruction. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=428.70000000000005s)]
*  But again, as Richard was just pointing out, nobody is showing their work here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=429.70000000000005s)]
*  No one is providing any details about what that's based on. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=433.94000000000005s)]
*  We had, you know, I keep going back to this one comment that we heard from President Trump [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  yesterday at The Hague where he said that people have had eyes on. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=442.42s)]
*  We've got no information about exactly who those people were. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=446.24s)]
*  Whether it was some country's intelligence agents, which would be a pretty shocking admission [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=450.54s)]
*  by the president to make, or whether it was some sort of a monitoring body that we're [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=455.22s)]
*  not aware of. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=458.42s)]
*  But those are the kinds of details that we don't have is exactly if, in fact, these facilities [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=459.86s)]
*  like the one at Forto was in fact was destroyed, then how do we know that? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=464.18s)]
*  We have these overhead satellite images that were shown today. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=471.0s)]
*  And there is the compelling case that was laid out by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=474.82000000000005s)]
*  for what the mission was and how it was executed exactly the way that it was supposed to be executed. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=480.42s)]
*  But that doesn't provide the evidence that with the execution of it, no matter how perfectly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=486.42s)]
*  they the men and women in those aircraft actually conducted the mission, that it actually was [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  the bombs did the job that they were supposed to do. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=498.26s)]
*  What we saw today was video of testing where the bombs did what they were supposed to do. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily translate into the real world. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=507.1s)]
*  That's that piece, that last piece that we simply don't have at this point, Ana. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=510.9s)]
*  And candidly, the officials who I'm speaking to here say that it's because it doesn't exist [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=515.02s)]
*  yet. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=519.46s)]
*  That information just is not clear even to the intelligence community at this point. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=520.46s)]
*  I'm curious how you see things right now, Mark, in terms of just sort of the debate [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=523.58s)]
*  even within the administration, because I say that it's within the administration. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=529.18s)]
*  It was the Defense Department's own agency and Intel that was part of that initial assessment [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=534.14s)]
*  saying the nuclear program may have been set back only three to six months. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=539.5s)]
*  And then you have the defense secretary saying, no, it was obliterated. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=542.86s)]
*  It was completely destroyed. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=546.74s)]
*  I mean, there's that debate happening internally. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=548.26s)]
*  And so what do you see as far as what's going on here and who should Americans trust? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=552.66s)]
*  What kind of intelligence can we trust right now? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=558.74s)]
*  Well, I think, Ana, this is a spectacular own goal by the administration. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=561.42s)]
*  And so when a policymaker, in this case, the president of the United States, comes out [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=565.58s)]
*  with a definitive statement, in essence, his own analytic statement, that's going to then [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=569.1s)]
*  throw the entire system into chaos because, as has been noted, bomb damage assessment [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=572.86s)]
*  takes a lot of time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=577.62s)]
*  It's the receipt of signals intelligence. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=578.94s)]
*  That's intercepts of Iranian leadership communications, military communications, intelligence, the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=580.7s)]
*  scientific establishment. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=585.1s)]
*  It's human sources on the ground who sometimes can't be met right away. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=586.66s)]
*  Perhaps they do have eyes on the facility. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  And of course, there's other, as the chairman mentioned today, technical means, whether [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=592.34s)]
*  from imagery or other such satellites, that would help us understand things. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=596.18s)]
*  But this is a dynamic process and it takes a lot of time. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=600.3s)]
*  But now you have the case in which 50 percent of the, you know, half the American people, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=603.3s)]
*  whatever CIA Director Ratcliffe says or DNI Tulsi Gabbard says, they're not going to believe [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  it because they're just going to think that they're falling in line with the president. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=611.8599999999999s)]
*  And it's too bad because ultimately, I think this was a strike in which there certainly [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=615.38s)]
*  were pretty significant effects that were carried out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=619.18s)]
*  And I think you can say this was a success in many ways, but it's just going to be questioned [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=622.98s)]
*  by so many. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=629.1s)]
*  And again, I think it's just an own goal. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=630.1s)]
*  And for the people, the intelligence community, by the way, this is a nightmare scenario because [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=631.46s)]
*  you need to have that independent means or the independent ability to conduct analysis. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=634.78s)]
*  And I think that's gone now. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=638.46s)]
*  Monica, with Gabbard apparently sidelined again, she's not going to be part of the briefings [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=640.46s)]
*  today or tomorrow, as is our understanding. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=644.74s)]
*  Does the president have any top aides around him who do give him information that may diverge [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=646.9s)]
*  from his preferred narrative? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=651.58s)]
*  I think so, Ana. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=654.1s)]
*  And this is a president who takes in a lot of different information before he makes decisions. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=655.1s)]
*  But we got a little bit of insight into this specifically from the chairman of the Joint [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=659.06s)]
*  Chiefs, Dan Cain, who said that he wasn't susceptible to any kind of outside influence [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=662.5s)]
*  and how he gives information to the president when he does. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=667.52s)]
*  Listen. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=671.1s)]
*  My job as the chairman is to offer a range of options to the president. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=672.1s)]
*  I've never been pressured by the president or the secretary to do anything other than [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=678.26s)]
*  tell him exactly what I'm thinking. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=682.5799999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what I've done. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=684.38s)]
*  And we know from our reporting that there are several generals who are often giving [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=687.7399999999999s)]
*  him that kind of information when he is briefed or getting his intelligence briefing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=690.8599999999999s)]
*  And then you mentioned specifically the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=695.5s)]
*  Ana, I'm told that even though, yes, they obviously have very differing opinions, she [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=698.78s)]
*  was in the key meetings leading up to the decision to authorize the strikes over the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=702.7s)]
*  nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=707.6600000000001s)]
*  But it is notable to point out that she won't be part of that list of briefers since many [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=709.34s)]
*  others in the administration are going to be speaking with lawmakers today. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gbaaEypcaI&t=713.0200000000001s)]
