# Trump the war hawk? Douglas Brinkley on Trump becoming first U.S. President to bomb Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI)
*  and professor of history at Rice University, Douglas Brinkley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor Brinkley, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=5.12s)]
*  Let's start with a look back at history through the eyes of J.D. Vance and his criticism that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=7.2s)]
*  previous presidents were dumb, this president was smart. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=12.32s)]
*  This is happening at the same time that Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, was saying [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=16.26s)]
*  the intelligence doesn't matter, yet again politicizing the intelligence community that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=19.78s)]
*  led us to this moment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=25.38s)]
*  It seems that history is repeating itself, albeit with different leaders. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=26.64s)]
*  Well, yes, and the War Powers Act's been corroding. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=31.16s)]
*  It's been evaporating over recent years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=35.96s)]
*  But you can just go back to counter J.D. Vance. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Ronald Reagan in 1981 condemned Israel for striking a facility in Baghdad that they said [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=40.6s)]
*  was a nuclear reactor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=48.68s)]
*  You had George W. Bush attack and criticize Israel for striking a reactor in Syria. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=50.12s)]
*  So Israel's always wanting to deal with, as it should, with existential threats in this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=58.72s)]
*  region. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=63.72s)]
*  But this time around, we're now going into this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=64.72s)]
*  The proper thing we'll do to do would be to go for international law and U.S. law to go [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=67.24s)]
*  through the Senate and have a hearing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=73.2s)]
*  And very well, the votes will be there for Trump in a war with Iran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=75.8s)]
*  But to keep the American people just shut out of it all as if we're living in some sort [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=79.48s)]
*  of authoritarian Trump land is a dire mistake for our democracy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=84.72s)]
*  Historically, why have previous presidents been hesitant to take this kind of action [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=90.68s)]
*  against Iran? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, Jimmy Carter, when he was president, we had famously President Carter [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  against his own. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  He was trying not to let the shaw of Iran into the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  But Henry Kissinger and others, the influencing to leave the shaw here and then the shaw [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=108.55999999999999s)]
*  bounced around the U.S. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=113.36s)]
*  We sent him to Panama and he went to Egypt and died. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  And of course, we have the hostage crisis under Carter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  But Carter refused to bomb Tehran hostages because he was a president concerned with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=120.8s)]
*  human rights, humanitarian concerns and triggering a potential World War Three or world [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  cataclysm. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=131.6s)]
*  So Carter is a 180 opposite of of what President Trump has just done here with Iran. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=132.76000000000002s)]
*  And it's a large country, big military, with big power. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  And we just had we know we love our veterans, what they did in Iraq and what we've done [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  in Afghanistan. But there is a kind of allergic reaction to getting involved with a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=148.72s)]
*  another war in the Middle East wars that have been going on there for thousands of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=153.44s)]
*  years. On the other hand, Israel's our great friend and we have to defend that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  democracy. It's not a good idea to have nuclear reactors there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=162.0s)]
*  But the intelligence is all pickled. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=166.68s)]
*  Even Trump's own administration has two views. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=169.04s)]
*  Did as Netanyahu say, Iran have the ability to make nuclear weapons? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=171.68s)]
*  Did they or did they not? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=176.56s)]
*  But we don't want to do the ropey dope game that George W. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=178.52s)]
*  Bush did when there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq until there weren't. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=181.96s)]
*  And so we need to act with clarity. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=186.32s)]
*  And you do that by going through the Senate, taking a vote, sharing your intelligence [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  information so the American people feel part of the decision, along with our troops [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=193.0s)]
*  feeling that this is a democratic action. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=197.88s)]
*  Professor Brinkley, this all comes at a time when Trump is doing quite poorly in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=201.0s)]
*  terms of favorability ratings on domestic issues, whether we're talking about [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  inflation, the economy, immigration, his handling of protests, etc. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=212.64s)]
*  I'm curious, is there any historical correlation between presidents willingness to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=217.6s)]
*  take more aggressive military action at times when their domestic agenda or their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=224.64s)]
*  domestic popularity is flagging? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Basically, is that just a coincidence or does it seem like there's greater incentive [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  for politicians to take this action then? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Great question. I mean, when you think about Lyndon Johnson back when he was running [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=241.76s)]
*  for President 64, he was worried that Barry Goldwater, the Republicans, could [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=246.16s)]
*  out hawk him on Vietnam. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=250.48s)]
*  So hence the U.S. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=252.64s)]
*  concocted, Johnson concocted a Gulf of Tonkin crisis and out of it, we enter [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=254.32s)]
*  World War and a world war situation with Vietnam. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  Yet, yet Johnson did the right thing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=264.96s)]
*  He rushed it to the Senate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=267.08s)]
*  He got a vote. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=268.48s)]
*  Wayne Morris, Senator from Oregon, wasn't into the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=269.36s)]
*  Ernest Groening of Alaska said no. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=274.48s)]
*  But at least Johnson, when we went into Vietnam, said, hey, I got approval from the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=276.84s)]
*  Senate. Cut to Richard Nixon. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=283.32s)]
*  Nixon's the one who in 19, you know, herding Vietnam started calling, changing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=285.84s)]
*  language, saying, well, look, it's an incursion into Cambodia. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=292.6s)]
*  No, it's a war in Cambodia. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=296.48s)]
*  We're bombing it. It's a secret bombing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=298.32s)]
*  And because of Nixon's malfeasance, we created a War Powers Act. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=301.32s)]
*  And you have to abide by it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=306.56s)]
*  One of the great foreign policy presidents in American history, George Herbert Walker [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=308.2s)]
*  Bush, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, what did Bush 41 do? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=312.0s)]
*  He didn't go in immediately. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=317.36s)]
*  He did the methodical work of going through the UN and going through, you know, the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=319.24s)]
*  NATO and getting the world behind a resolute action. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=324.8s)]
*  This was just sort of a rogue one offer. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=328.64s)]
*  But I think Obama did one a little bit like Trump. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  And he's and he saw Trump when he took out a chemical facility in Syria, his first [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=333.92s)]
*  term. So the idea is you can strike and call it a day. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  But you're striking a Cobra now that can spring in any direction. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=343.36s)]
*  And at the very least, the policy might be right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  Let's work with Israel, take them out. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  But you've got to go through the U.S. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=351.48s)]
*  Senate. And I'm hopeful that that will be the case this this week. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=353.72s)]
*  I think it will be this Friday. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=358.88s)]
*  There should be a vote. Douglas Brinkley, thank you so much for bringing that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  historical perspective to what we're all living through right now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ5JMAS7eI&t=363.91999999999996s)]
