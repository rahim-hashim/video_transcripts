# We will meet escalation with escalation': Houthi member responds to U.S. and U.K. airstrikes
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE)
*  One of the things that we need to think about here is that, in fact, we've got a response [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=0.0s)]
*  from the Houthi political bureau in which this will continue until the aggression against [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=5.3s)]
*  Gaza stops. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=12.94s)]
*  No matter what sacrifices it costs us, we will meet escalation with escalation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=13.94s)]
*  What actually acts as a deterrent to these groups? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=18.98s)]
*  Because they're not little groups. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=21.3s)]
*  You would think that if America is bombing a bunch of little groups, they'll get the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  message that we're not going to war with America. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=26.4s)]
*  But these groups have resources that small, non-government actors typically don't have [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=28.5s)]
*  because they've got Iran. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=34.9s)]
*  They're getting their training from Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=35.94s)]
*  The weaponry that the Houthis have been using to target these ships in the Red Sea, that's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=37.6s)]
*  not weaponry that the Houthis would typically have. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=42.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=45.72s)]
*  They would not be where they are today if it weren't for Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=46.72s)]
*  And trying to goad the United States into a war for them is like reeling in a big fish. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=50.32s)]
*  Because if they're able to use the Israel-Gaza conflict as a reason to pursue these attacks, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=55.66s)]
*  and that is what it is, I want to be very clear, that for them is a cover. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=60.68s)]
*  While these attacks didn't exist before, you had attacks in Iraq and Syria before. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=65.0s)]
*  The Houthis are jumping on this bandwagon now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=69.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=71.12s)]
*  Because it gives them legitimacy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=72.12s)]
*  It gives them notoriety. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=73.12s)]
*  It allows them to further fundraise, to further recruit, to get more support from Iran, and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  to give themselves a bigger name than they had before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  And so suddenly they're on the map. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=82.16s)]
*  And suddenly all of us are talking about the Houthis. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=83.82s)]
*  And so they're not a small group. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=85.8s)]
*  But I would still clarify that they are rather juvenile. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=87.08s)]
*  They are rather toddler in the grand scheme of military capabilities. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=90.88s)]
*  And what the United States is trying to do is, by striking them again today, the ones [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  you just saw, the ones in the last half hour, that was deliberate to follow on the strikes [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=100.6s)]
*  that took place in Iraq and Syria yesterday, because the U.S. likely expected the Houthis [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=105.94s)]
*  to be the ones to have the ability to retaliate now that the U.S. degraded the military capabilities [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=110.74s)]
*  of those groups in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=115.9s)]
*  And that's very much part of typical U.S. military planning. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=117.98s)]
*  They do these in tiers, in levels, in part to continue the message and the effort, but [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=121.94s)]
*  also to try and push back and say, you know what, there are a bunch of options you can [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=128.94s)]
*  pursue if you try to get back at us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAvQUQv7tE&t=133.82s)]
