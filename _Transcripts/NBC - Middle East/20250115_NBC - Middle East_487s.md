# ‘Beginning of the end’ Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire deal and hostage release
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw)
*  Joining us now is Richard Haas, the President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=0.0s)]
*  So, nothing is done till it's done, but Richard, from all of my sources, this is going to be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=4.4s)]
*  announced by the Qataris, as you can understand. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Diplomatically, the Israelis and the U.S. have agreed that Qatar should announce it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=16.32s)]
*  first. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=21.16s)]
*  They were the host for the talks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=22.16s)]
*  They were the go-between with Hamas, these indirect talks that have been going on for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=24.0s)]
*  so many months. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=28.36s)]
*  I can report that William Burns, the CIA director, has been in Washington this week, but that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=30.0s)]
*  he made 19 trips on this subject to the region, as well as meetings that were held elsewhere [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=36.72s)]
*  in Europe and elsewhere. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=44.32s)]
*  But 19 trips just since October 7th, when the hostages were taken, that we know that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=45.86s)]
*  Secretary of State Blinken made 13 trips, and all of these trips involved multiple countries. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=54.76s)]
*  13 missions with Secretary Blinken. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=59.76s)]
*  I was on many of them, where he would go to seven or eight countries on one of those trips [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=62.32s)]
*  all around the region trying to put things together, and also trying to work on what [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=66.6s)]
*  would happen after this deal, what would happen to try to rebuild Gaza, to try to create a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian entity to lead Gaza, to try to end an Israeli occupation, which would be [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  ended for all intents and purposes except for that border area, the border buffer and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  the border area near the Philadelphia corridor near Egypt and Ra'a. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=87.1s)]
*  Richard, this is an enormous deal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=92.5s)]
*  There's been an enormous amount of work done on it, and a big factor acknowledged by Secretary [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=95.66s)]
*  Blinken to me just this week was the terrific work in the last couple of days of Steve Witkoff, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=102.22s)]
*  the new Trump Middle East negotiator, the envoy who is going to be coming in, and he [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=108.5s)]
*  went to Doha, and the fact that starting on December 2nd, Donald Trump said on Truth Social [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=114.86s)]
*  and then repeated it a week ago Tuesday at his news conference, that marathon news conference [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=121.26s)]
*  that to Hamas that they would be held to pay in the Middle East if they didn't do this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=126.62s)]
*  deal before he's sworn in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=132.26s)]
*  So they might just make that deadline if these hostages start coming out on Sunday over the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=134.14s)]
*  weekend. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=139.94s)]
*  Richard? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=140.94s)]
*  Yeah, Angela, let me say three things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=141.94s)]
*  First, obviously, this is welcome. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=144.7s)]
*  The hostages have just been, it's been a nightmare for them, for their families, for the entire [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=147.38s)]
*  country of Israel, for people in this country who are focused on it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=153.14s)]
*  So a sigh of relief that hopefully this is the beginning of the end of that ordeal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=157.78s)]
*  Secondly, it's interesting that it happened now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=164.86s)]
*  Why now as opposed to any time over the last 15 months? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=168.3s)]
*  And I think there's multiple things at work here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=172.74s)]
*  One, as you mentioned, the Trump administration, the pressure they were putting on, that clearly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=174.78s)]
*  had its effect mostly in Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  I would think between Mr. Witkoff, who will be the Trump envoy, but the Israeli government [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=181.22s)]
*  clearly wanted to get off on a good foot with Donald Trump. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=187.42s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted this somewhat be off the off the agenda. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  I think what mattered more on the Hamas side was not the threats. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  There's really nothing in the state that will be held to pay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=198.82s)]
*  Probably dozens have already been to hell and back, or actually they're still there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=201.06s)]
*  The Israelis have been bouncing the rubble. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=206.06s)]
*  No, I think there it has to do much more with Iran's weakness and above all, Hezbollah's weakness. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=208.3s)]
*  When Hezbollah a few months ago signaled that it would sign a ceasefire with Israel and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=213.34s)]
*  no longer link it to this, I think that left Hamas much more exposed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=218.10000000000002s)]
*  The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=224.3s)]
*  The entire region has moved against Iran, against Hamas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=226.9s)]
*  I think that had a lot to do with it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=230.38000000000002s)]
*  And then thirdly, yes, this is significant and I don't want to in any way belittle it, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=232.74s)]
*  but coming back to a phrase I use in terms of diplomacy, this might be the end of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  beginning in the sense that there's a lot to come, as significant as this is, as difficult [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=242.42s)]
*  as it is, as much time as it took from Bill Burns and Tony Blinken. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  And again, without diminishing all the effort, we still have other phases of this ceasefire [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=251.14s)]
*  to come. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=256.34s)]
*  We've got the larger question of governance and security in Gaza. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=258.38s)]
*  And then you've got the incomparably larger question of hopefully Israel's relationship [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  with the Palestinians in the West Bank, where you've got roughly three million Palestinians [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=267.82s)]
*  there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=272.61999999999995s)]
*  But this is a day, and hopefully if it all holds, and I think it's likely to, it's a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=273.61999999999995s)]
*  day to feel relief, maybe even some celebration, but also with a sober awareness of the difficult, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=277.38s)]
*  extraordinarily difficult decisions and challenges to come. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  And we should also point out on this timeline, the timeline as explained to me by people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  involved in the talks from all three sides, not the Hamas side obviously, is that once [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=294.7s)]
*  the deal is announced, once Qatar is satisfied that all the branches of Hamas have accepted [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=302.42s)]
*  it, which we're told has happened today, that that means that Israel will then trigger its [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=307.94s)]
*  security cabinet meeting, then its full cabinet meeting, then there is what may be a very [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=315.02s)]
*  quick referral to the Israeli Supreme Court, which has to give some number of hours for [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  a potential appeal. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=328.06s)]
*  That I think can be accelerated. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=329.82s)]
*  Then the deal would go into effect, so it could take a day or so to get all of the Israeli [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=332.18s)]
*  pieces in place, and then the deal goes into effect. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=338.82s)]
*  Once that happens, there is a 48-hour window to see if it holds and to make all the arrangements [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=343.18s)]
*  to actually physically move the hostages out of where they are in Gaza. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=348.78s)]
*  And then the beginning of the hostages release. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=353.61999999999995s)]
*  And that would happen in phases. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=358.7s)]
*  This is all in phase one of the six-week deal. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  The first phase is six weeks. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  And the hostages would be released in priority of those who are wounded, the women first [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=367.73999999999995s)]
*  of all, and those who are wounded, the elderly, children, and then at the end of that process [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=372.22s)]
*  would come the remains that people are grieving to have, including a number of American families [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=382.38s)]
*  who are very well aware that their hostages have not survived this ordeal. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=390.54s)]
*  Richard? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=394.74s)]
*  What's also interesting is how both Hamas and Israel compromised to some extent. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=394.94s)]
*  Israel basically said its goal was to eliminate Hamas. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=401.74s)]
*  Well, Hamas has not been eliminated. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  They've accepted a ceasefire. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=408.18s)]
*  Hamas has compromised, too. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=410.06s)]
*  Israel is not 100 percent out of Gaza. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=411.7s)]
*  This is not a permanent end, quote unquote, to the occupation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=413.98s)]
*  So again, I think it shows that both sides have moved. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=417.86s)]
*  When you put your finger on it, what I think is going to be very interesting, the internal [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=420.86s)]
*  debate in Israel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  As you know better than anybody, several members of the current governing coalition oppose [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=425.82s)]
*  this deal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=429.82s)]
*  The far-right finance minister, the security minister. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=430.98s)]
*  So the question is, what does Israeli politics look like in two or three days? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=435.38s)]
*  People not in the governing coalition said they'll support the government on this issue. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=440.82s)]
*  But what then? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=445.1s)]
*  What does Bibi Netanyahu have in two or three days? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=446.22s)]
*  Is this simply something he works through, or is this actually something of a challenge [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=449.9s)]
*  to his government? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=455.4s)]
*  And I think that will be a really interesting space to watch, because that will obviously [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=457.66s)]
*  have implications for domestic and international policy, foreign policy for Israel going forward. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLlNmJzEWw&t=461.46000000000004s)]
