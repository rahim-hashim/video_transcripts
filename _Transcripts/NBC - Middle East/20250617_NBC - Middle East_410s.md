# Will Trump follow Israel into war? 'Bunker-buster bomb' drop would make U.S. 'directly involved'
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk)
*  Let me bring in in the meantime Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser under [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=0.0s)]
*  President Obama and an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=4.04s)]
*  Ben, this is a critical moment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=7.28s)]
*  I don't think either side would disagree with that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=8.96s)]
*  On one hand, you have what Peter just said. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=12.76s)]
*  You have a president who campaigned and whose position has long been that we stay out of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=14.36s)]
*  conflicts like this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, you have the conversations that are going on about Fordo. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=22.16s)]
*  If a bunker buster bomb, which by the way, we should say Benjamin Netanyahu has wanted [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=26.6s)]
*  since, I don't know what, going back to the Bush administration and has always been told [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  no, if that is on the table and if indeed it goes forward, how much of a game changer [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=36.44s)]
*  would that be? Not for Israel, just, but obviously for what the U.S. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=42.6s)]
*  is willing to do in the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=49.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it'd be a massive game changer, Chris. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=52.36s)]
*  I mean, we're already involved in some way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=55.0s)]
*  I mean, we're obviously helping support Israel to defend itself against Iran's reprisals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=57.96s)]
*  But the reality here is that dropping a gigantic bunker buster bomb on the Fordo facility [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=65.12s)]
*  puts the United States directly involved in offensive preemptive war against Iran, not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=71.76s)]
*  just a war, but a war that was launched preemptively. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=78.44s)]
*  And it raises all kinds of questions. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=81.08s)]
*  What is the legal basis for this? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  And some Democratic senators have raised this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=87.28s)]
*  There's not really any legal authorization for Trump to be doing this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=88.72s)]
*  Now, he probably doesn't care about that, but the rest of the world does. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  What happens after this if it continues to escalate, if the Iranian regime falls, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=96.04s)]
*  Because the Israeli government seems to be escalating towards potentially getting rid of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  that regime. What takes its place? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=106.84s)]
*  And the last 25 years is full of examples of wars in the Middle East that seemed like [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=109.0s)]
*  they were going well at the beginning. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=115.44s)]
*  But particularly if you have the regime fall, we've seen how messy that can get and how [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  much worse that can get. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  So people don't seem to be thinking two or three moves ahead here, Chris, is what my [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=124.24s)]
*  concern is. And Trump, you know, when we used to game out what might happen, it was [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  always a case that Prime Minister Netanyahu was going to want the United States to come into [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=135.12s)]
*  this war in part for this precise purpose of blowing up the Fordo facility, which Iran [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  cannot do. The question is, though, once the United States is in this war, where does it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  go from there? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=149.44s)]
*  Well, if you take the president's tweet at his word, which is that we have complete and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=151.0s)]
*  total control of the skies over Iran and obviously Iran often portrayed as one of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  world's most dangerous actors, but appears to be in a more weakened position right now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=160.44s)]
*  Does Israel have good military options that don't require a deeper U.S. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=166.04s)]
*  involvement? Not if they really want to destroy that Fordo facility. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=171.6s)]
*  It's buried deep underground. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think the concern has been if the Iranians decide that, you know, they have no recourse [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  for their own security except to try to dash out and weaponize and acquire enough material for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  a nuclear weapon that they might want to go deep underground, not just at Fordo, but [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=188.8s)]
*  maybe even at other places. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=193.36s)]
*  And the reality is, absent this kind of weapon, the only way to otherwise for Israel to get [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=194.68s)]
*  at this facility is on the ground to go in themselves. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=200.84s)]
*  They can't they can't blow it up with munitions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  That's why the Iranians buried it deep underground. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=205.4s)]
*  So their option is for the United States to do this or for the United States to somehow [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=208.96s)]
*  provide them with these weapons to do it, which basically puts us in it in a different kind [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=213.52s)]
*  of way. And again, just to voice some caution here, Chris, and we had total dominance over [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=218.68s)]
*  the skies of Iraq. We had total dominance over the skies of Afghanistan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=224.88s)]
*  We told dominance over the skies of Libya. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  And those consequences negatively didn't manifest for a while, but they did. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=230.72s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump's been talking about on his campaigns. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=234.6s)]
*  The last three presidential campaigns, he wouldn't do precisely this action because we've [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=238.4s)]
*  seen how that turned out in the past. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  So obviously, Israel sees this as an opportunity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=245.68s)]
*  They've knocked out their defenses. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=249.28s)]
*  They've taken a bunch of shots at Iranian leadership at Iranian nuclear and military [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=250.68s)]
*  facilities. Now they really want to finish what they see as finishing the job against the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=255.12s)]
*  existing current Iranian nuclear program. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=260.08s)]
*  And the ball is in Donald Trump's court here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=263.8s)]
*  Is he going to follow them into this offensive war with unpredictable consequences that will [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=266.04s)]
*  come after whatever takes place here? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=272.4s)]
*  Or is he going to try to pull back and strike some deal with the Iranians to to bring an end [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=275.96s)]
*  to this, at least for the time being? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=281.48s)]
*  And I should say in the Middle East, it will only be for the time being. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=284.44s)]
*  And really, this is a pretty huge decision he's got on his plate. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, what is the fact that the president felt he had to leave the G7, come back to the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=292.24s)]
*  U.S., tell you about the nature of this moment, Trump's approach to it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=297.44s)]
*  Would it have been helpful, for example, to stay with other world leaders, work through this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=302.16s)]
*  next stage together? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=306.64s)]
*  I think it tells you a lot, Chris, because, yeah, normally it actually be seen as convenient [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=308.72s)]
*  to have the G7 together. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=313.8s)]
*  You know, you'd want to sit with your allies and plan out, well, what what what happens if [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=315.16s)]
*  we do this or what happens to support diplomacy? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=320.32s)]
*  Either course of action would benefit from those allies who are around that table. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=323.0s)]
*  And a part of whatever played is that the United States chooses to run here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  So what it tells you is that Donald Trump doesn't care about allies, that he doesn't really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=333.2s)]
*  want them at the table. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=337.36s)]
*  He doesn't want them involved in his decisions, that this will be a decision made with his [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=339.0s)]
*  advisors and with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=343.36s)]
*  And that is I mean, we've seen a lot of things that are different from the past, Chris. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=345.88s)]
*  I mean, successive American presidents have cautioned against precisely this military [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=349.76s)]
*  action that we're seeing unfold in Iran, including Donald Trump, by the way, during his first [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  term, when he didn't take this action, even after Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=359.48s)]
*  service members in Iraq in response to the assassination of the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=365.88000000000005s)]
*  Guard commander. So what it tells you is he's going to do this unilaterally. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  With a very small circle of advisors in the White House, and he's going to do this in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  consultation with Bibi Netanyahu and not with the traditional American allies that you [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=380.48s)]
*  would want to consult with before taking this step. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  Ben Rhodes, thank you so much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mHQJVFWQyk&t=388.76s)]
