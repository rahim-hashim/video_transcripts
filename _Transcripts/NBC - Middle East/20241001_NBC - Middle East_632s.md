# ‘Iran should not mess with us’: IDF reacts to U.S. indications Iran is prepping imminent attack
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680)
*  Joining us now is Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=5.28s)]
*  What information does the Israeli military have about this possible imminent attack from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Iran? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=11.4s)]
*  Well, we received the information from our allies, from our colleagues in the U.S. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=12.4s)]
*  We're following the situation currently. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=18.32s)]
*  We have no indication that something is actually heading our way. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=19.78s)]
*  But of course, there is a possibility that that will happen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=23.72s)]
*  So we are prepared for any eventuality, for any scenario. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=27.5s)]
*  Our forces, our aerial defenses are on high alert in the case that something does head [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=31.1s)]
*  our way from Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  And of course, we need to be very, very, I think, accurate and cautious. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=37.54s)]
*  And that's precisely why the IDF has issued renewed home front command instructions to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=43.9s)]
*  the people of Israel, limiting the amount of people that gather at one place at any [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=50.34s)]
*  time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=54.82s)]
*  So we're taking it seriously, but we are confident that we can defend ourselves. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=56.18s)]
*  We will, of course, be in deep coordination with our American friends in order to try [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=61.02s)]
*  and field off any attacks that can originate from Iran. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=67.62s)]
*  This isn't the first time that this happened. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=74.38s)]
*  And so we understand the types of threats that we face. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=76.82s)]
*  But the situation remains that we are focused currently on pushing Hezbollah back in Lebanon [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=80.58s)]
*  in order to restore safety and security to Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=89.06s)]
*  That's what the civilians that have been living out of their home now for a year deserve. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=91.38s)]
*  I want to talk to you more about that, but just given this potential imminent threat [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=95.62s)]
*  from Iran and our reporting is it could be a ballistic missile attack. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=98.78s)]
*  As our reporters described it, these are missiles that can go from launch to impact in about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=103.38s)]
*  12 minutes from Iran into Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=110.42s)]
*  So they are faster and they have more firepower than maybe some of those missiles deployed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=113.66s)]
*  in the last time we saw a direct attack from Iran into Israel back in April. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=119.9s)]
*  How soon could this come in? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=125.2s)]
*  Are you all maneuvering differently now with this news? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  So last April, it was indeed a similar scenario, indeed ballistic missiles, cruise missiles [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=133.0s)]
*  and drones. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=138.66s)]
*  And each of them have their own flight time from Iran to Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=139.66s)]
*  Indeed, 12 minutes is a short time, but long enough for our aerial defense systems both [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=143.82s)]
*  to identify and intercept. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  And that's how we were successful in April. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=153.04s)]
*  And we are holding a very, very high level of readiness and preparedness to confront anything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=155.7s)]
*  that could come our way. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=161.34s)]
*  I think that it's not something new, but we do need to be vigilant. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=163.38000000000002s)]
*  We need to be prepared. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=169.5s)]
*  And I think most importantly is we need to be able to keep our civilians here in Israel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=170.5s)]
*  safe and secure and aware of how quick things can change from one minute to another from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=175.5s)]
*  a security perspective. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  A key justification for the IDF incursion into Lebanon has been to make northern Israel [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  safe for Israelis to return home, as you've described. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=186.66000000000003s)]
*  Does the prospect of an Iranian attack complicate that goal in Lebanon? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=189.82s)]
*  I think we revealed today extensive footage of what we've revealed from the Lebanese side [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=195.94s)]
*  of the border, the staging grounds, the weapons caches, the plans themselves to infiltrate [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=201.7s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=210.92s)]
*  So all of that considered, we have no choice but to make sure that Hezbollah do not reside [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  and loom over us from the northern border. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=219.5s)]
*  And that is why the government instructed the IDF to go on the offensive after a year [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=222.78s)]
*  almost of negotiations of trying to come to a negotiated agreement that would get Hezbollah [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=227.82s)]
*  out of this area. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=234.06s)]
*  Unfortunately, it did not succeed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=235.42s)]
*  And that's why we are currently moving forward. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=237.1s)]
*  So yes, of course, there is complications. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=239.94s)]
*  And when we see Iran getting involved, it reminds me, I think, of the 8th of October [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=241.42s)]
*  last year when Hezbollah decided to get involved. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=246.86s)]
*  I think there's a lot to be lost. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  And I would say to Iran, look very cautiously and carefully of how we decapitated Hezbollah [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=252.46s)]
*  in the last week, taking out their senior commanders, their operational commanders, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=259.06s)]
*  their strategic assets, or vast majority of those. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=263.22s)]
*  Look very closely of how we've dealt with Hamas. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  On the other hand, nobody has an interest to further escalate the situation in the region. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  We just want our people to be able to go back home and live in safety and security. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=275.34s)]
*  That can be delivered, as Hezbollah needs to retreat in accordance to those agreements [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=279.82s)]
*  of the United Nations Security Council resolution, back to the Litani. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=284.73999999999995s)]
*  We are currently operating in the border area, in targeted, precise, and limited in location [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  areas, precisely to deliver that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=294.34s)]
*  So I would say we would operate on one hand to defend our skies from any potential Iranian [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  threat, but absolutely push forward to make sure that Hezbollah cannot launch direct attacks, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=302.18s)]
*  cannot breach the border area, and perhaps try and conduct an infiltration or an invasion [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=309.02s)]
*  into Israel, because from the plans that we found, and also from what they've broadcasted [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=316.98s)]
*  over the years, that is clearly what they were planning to do, to breach the border, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=321.24s)]
*  storm into the border with their Radwan forces, which are their special forces, come into [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=325.94s)]
*  our communities, abduct, kill, massacre in the northern, the Kibbutzim, the communities, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=331.5s)]
*  the towns. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=337.1s)]
*  And that, from our perspective, of course, is unacceptable. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=338.1s)]
*  And also in the aftermath of October 7th and the Hamas attack in the south, it is a very, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=341.22s)]
*  very sore spot, and Israel just can't tolerate even the concept that a Hamas or Hezbollah [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=346.86s)]
*  or anybody on any of our borders will pose such a threat ever again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=353.38s)]
*  So coming back to this potential threat from Iran and this development we're learning of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=357.38s)]
*  this morning here in the U.S., I'm thinking about what we heard from Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=361.82s)]
*  the prime minister of Israel, last week at the UN, where he made a direct statement toward [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=366.74s)]
*  Tehran, saying, if you strike us, we will strike you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=372.62s)]
*  That is a quote. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=377.92s)]
*  What is Israel prepared to do in response if Iran launches this ballistic missile strike? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=378.92s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to hypothesize about what we can do. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=386.06s)]
*  Of course, if we want a glimpse into our capabilities, our operational capabilities, we flew our [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=389.06s)]
*  fighter jets all the way to Yemen, 1,200 miles away from Israel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=396.26000000000005s)]
*  Iran and Tehran are within our reach if needs be. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think the prime minister's words were very clear. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=408.26000000000005s)]
*  Iran should not mess with us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=412.22s)]
*  We have shown that we have the abilities, the capabilities, and that we have the resolve [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=414.1s)]
*  to defend the people of Israel. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=419.38000000000005s)]
*  So as this operation is underway in Lebanon, how long do you anticipate that operation [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=421.5s)]
*  will last? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=425.98s)]
*  You called it limited, localized, and targeted. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=426.98s)]
*  I think that the priority is to make sure that the conditions so that Israelis can get [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=430.3s)]
*  home is reached. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=434.5s)]
*  That is the primary goal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=438.5s)]
*  That is the cause, and that is what the government instructed us to do. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=441.1s)]
*  We need to make sure that the situation is safe enough for them to come back. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=444.18s)]
*  So I would say there's definitely, and what we've seen today, the amount and the extent [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=447.5s)]
*  of their infrastructure that they had built over the last 20 years to conduct those infiltrations, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=451.7s)]
*  to conduct those direct rocket attacks, anti-tank guided missile attacks, drone attacks, these [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=457.5s)]
*  types of things, they need to be gone. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=463.9s)]
*  I think that what I can say, and I'm confident that the delivery of our security can be delivered, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=466.18s)]
*  I think we need to be patient. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=475.26s)]
*  It won't be done by dinner. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=476.26s)]
*  I think there's an understanding that if a terrorist organization that has built under [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=478.14s)]
*  the nose and the watchful eye, perhaps being ignored by UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  Mission that is located in southern Lebanon for so many years, it's not going to be over [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=489.42s)]
*  quick. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=496.54s)]
*  We need to make sure that this is no longer a threat. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=497.54s)]
*  The UN, in fact, called this and said any crossing into Lebanon would be a violation [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=500.58s)]
*  of Lebanese sovereignty. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=505.66s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=507.54s)]
*  Well since the 8th of October, Hezbollah has been launching daily rocket attacks, missile [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  attacks, drone attacks. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  In the first month of the war, in October and November, there were seven attempts to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=517.9s)]
*  infiltrate our border, just like on October 7th. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=521.9399999999999s)]
*  So I would say with respect to the United Nations, we have been waiting for a diplomatic [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=525.4599999999999s)]
*  solution for a year now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  That diplomatic solution has not been reached up until now. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=533.0s)]
*  And so the government charged the IDF to restore safety and security to the north to make sure [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=537.18s)]
*  that there are conditions that Israelis can go home. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  And I would basically and fundamentally say you wouldn't like it if you had to be evacuated [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  from your house for security reasons, for an imminent terrorist threat. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=553.38s)]
*  You would not like it even more if it took a year to try and resolve. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  And you would, like any decent human being, demand from the government to restore safety [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=563.12s)]
*  and security for me, for my family, and for everyone. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=568.14s)]
*  And so I would say, yes, there is operations that are ongoing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=571.76s)]
*  We've been conducting covert operations, as we revealed earlier today here in Israel, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=576.08s)]
*  of the extent of what we found of the staging grounds, of the plans, of the munitions, the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=581.52s)]
*  weapons, a vast amount of tools of terror and death. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=587.04s)]
*  That is all they wanted to do. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=591.56s)]
*  And all of this would have made what happened on the 7th of October look pale. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=593.12s)]
*  And so that's an unbearable reality, unfathomable from any aspect of human existence, and a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=599.28s)]
*  reality that Israel just can't accept. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmC-MgU680&t=609.14s)]
