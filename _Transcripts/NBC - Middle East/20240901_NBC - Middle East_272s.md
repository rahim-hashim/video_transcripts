# Six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, found dead in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04)
*  With the breaking news from overnight, Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of six hostages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=0.0s)]
*  from Gaza, including Israeli-American Hirsch Goldberg-Polin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=5.64s)]
*  Late last night, President Biden said, quote, it is as tragic as it is reprehensible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=10.32s)]
*  Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes, and we will keep working around [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=17.6s)]
*  the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=22.48s)]
*  MSNBC foreign correspondent Matt Bradley joins us now from Tel Aviv in Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=26.8s)]
*  Matt, good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=32.2s)]
*  We were learning this was breaking late last night. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=34.68s)]
*  Can you bring our audience up to speed on what we know? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=38.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, we heard about this late last night, but today is kind of the day here in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=41.76s)]
*  Tel Aviv. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  We're expected to see protesters, thousands of them, descending to the streets of Tel [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Aviv in what has known as Hostage Square now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=53.08s)]
*  They've christened this square in central Tel Aviv because of the repeated protests [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=56.0s)]
*  all the time, demanding not just a hostage deal, but the resignation of Prime Minister [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=60.16s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  That is a really loud and clear signal that we've been hearing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  And you guys, when you talk about this situation, the political circumstance here, the people [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  who are advocating for the hostage release, who are advocating for Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=74.84s)]
*  Netanyahu to step down, that's kind of the same crowd. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=78.56s)]
*  It overlays very neatly over the culture wars here in Israel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=81.76s)]
*  It's a lot of the same crowd that we saw protesting up against Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial reforms [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=85.6s)]
*  even before October 7th last year when there were rolling protests. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=90.36s)]
*  I was here just a year ago for this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=93.76s)]
*  And so, you know, we're really seeing huge emotion here, not just for the release of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=96.56s)]
*  these hostages, but against the government. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=102.12s)]
*  And that is why when we heard just now from the hostage forum, the families forum, this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=104.8s)]
*  is the group that typically represents these families. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=109.76s)]
*  They want to see this expression of anger today that really is unprecedented. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=112.68s)]
*  Now, it's going to be hard to top what they've already been doing, not just over the past [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=118.2s)]
*  couple of months, but even last summer. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=122.36s)]
*  So it looks as though they said something to the effect of they want to make the nation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  shutter. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=128.12s)]
*  They want to shut it down. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=129.12s)]
*  So we're expecting huge protests tonight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=130.44s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=133.12s)]
*  And I don't want to go over the top here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=134.32s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if it gets violent because it has been getting violent in the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=136.36s)]
*  past. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, this is a very sad day for Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  They discovered these six bodies in a tunnel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=145.0s)]
*  And according to the IDF, they had been killed just moments before they were discovered as [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=147.0s)]
*  the military was bearing down on them inside this tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=153.56s)]
*  the city of Rafa. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=158.84s)]
*  But as we're talking about all of this, you know, at the same time, there's some positive [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  news. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=164.08s)]
*  He pauses in the fighting, starting today for a couple of hours every day for several [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=165.52s)]
*  weeks as health workers fan out across the Gaza Strip in isolated sections of Gaza to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  try to inoculate more than half a million children for polio. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  And this comes just about a week after we saw the first infant in the Gaza Strip afflicted [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=180.84s)]
*  with paralysis on one of his legs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=188.08s)]
*  He has polio. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=190.52s)]
*  This is the first case of polio in the Gaza Strip in 25 years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=191.56s)]
*  So now there's about a one point two million doses of this vaccine against polio, which, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=195.16s)]
*  by the way, is a very terrifying disease because it is totally, totally preventable, but it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=199.88s)]
*  is uncurable once it's been contracted. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  So that is why it is such a concern for global health advocates. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, this was a disease that was going the way of smallpox before we saw it here [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=218.68s)]
*  Really, I spoke with one World Health Organization representative yesterday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=219.72s)]
*  He was saying it's really only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=223.24s)]
*  So that's why the sighting of it in the Gaza Strip is so troubling and why after famine, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=227.88s)]
*  tens of thousands of deaths, mostly among civilians, according to the Gaza health authorities, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=234.08s)]
*  that hasn't been able to silence the guns. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=238.32s)]
*  But polio and the threat of this disease coming back, that has been able to create some sort [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=240.08s)]
*  of pause in various parts of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=246.24s)]
*  And we're going to be seeing that every day for the next several weeks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfdQu1Ae04&t=248.64s)]
