# The modern history Israeli-Lebanese relations
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ)
*  Despite both sides accusing each other of minor violations, the new ceasefire between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon appears to be holding so far. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the latest volley in the extremely fraught, deadly, and in some ways, cyclical modern history of Israel-Lebanese relations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=10.4s)]
*  Let's go back to 1943, when Lebanon gained independence from France, which controlled it via a post-World War I League of Nations mandate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=18.72s)]
*  The French mandate in Lebanon harkened back to the colonial era and acted as a sort of a sponsorship for specific Middle Eastern territories, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=28.16s)]
*  which used to be controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which collapsed at the end of World War I. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=35.84s)]
*  It was meant to eventually lead to a bunch of independent states. The other mandates were Iraq, Syria, and Palestine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=40.56s)]
*  The British were given control and governance over Palestine and Iraq, the French over Syria and Lebanon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, after World War II, the newly formed United Nations, which replaced the League of Nations, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  partitioned the British-Palestine mandate into three entities, an Arab state, a Jewish state, and a separate, internationally-led city, Jerusalem. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=60.08s)]
*  On May 14, 1948, Israel declared independence. The following day, the Arab League, at the time consisting of Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=70.64s)]
*  North Yemen, and Lebanon, invaded Israel. Soon after, the brand new state of Israel invaded Lebanon, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=81.84s)]
*  occupying a significant portion of the southern part of that country before an armistice agreement was signed in 1948-49. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=88.4s)]
*  Things remained relatively calm between Israel and Lebanon for decades, with Lebanon taking only small parts in the short 1967 and 1973 wars between several Arab nations and Israel. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=97.04s)]
*  But while relations between the two countries appeared cordial, the situation between Israel and militant groups operating within Lebanon was anything but. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=109.76s)]
*  Beginning with its formation in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PLO, based at the time in Lebanon, began attacks in Israel, responding to other Israeli attacks and leading to Israeli responses. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=119.28s)]
*  And that situation escalated for several years. In 1973, Israel conducted an incursion by sea into Lebanon, killing several PLO leaders. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=134.56s)]
*  This was in response to the assassination of multiple members of the Israeli delegation at the Munich Olympics the year before. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=145.04s)]
*  It's important to note that during this time, the PLO also clashed militarily and politically with the actual Lebanese government and its military. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=153.04s)]
*  A civil war in Lebanon broke out in 1975 between the Lebanese government and the Christian militias on one side, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=162.96s)]
*  and the PLO made up of both Muslims and Christians, and the Druze militias on the other. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  The Druze faith is an older offshoot of Shia Islam. And though it was largely a civil war, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  Israel was involved on the side of the Lebanese government and the non-PLO Christians, called the Maronites. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=183.12s)]
*  In 1978, the PLO conducted a deadly attack inside Israel, and in response, Israeli troops entered Lebanon, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=190.72s)]
*  holding a portion of the south for about a week and a half before turning the territory back to allies within the Lebanese government. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=198.4s)]
*  A similar situation occurred four years later, in 1982, when Israel again entered Lebanon following a PLO attack, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=206.32s)]
*  this time reaching nearly as far north as Beirut before occupying a southern portion of Lebanon, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  consisting of about 10% of the country. And Israel stayed there for 18 years until the year 2000. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Notice I haven't mentioned Hezbollah yet. Hezbollah is neither the PLO nor the Lebanese army. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah was formed in Lebanon in response to that 1982 Israeli invasion into an occupation of Lebanon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=233.44s)]
*  And notably, it was the only militia that was not forced to disarm as part of the Taif agreement, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=242.4s)]
*  which ended the Lebanese civil war in 1989. Hezbollah has since grown in power, becoming what's being called a state within a state, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=248.16s)]
*  and controlling significant portions of Lebanon, mainly in the south. And while it does operate a political entity in parliament, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=257.04s)]
*  it mainly exists as a separate fighting force with significant influence inside Lebanon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=263.92s)]
*  Throughout Israel's 18-year occupation, and for several years, there were constant attacks back and forth [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=270.0s)]
*  with a cross-border raid conducted by Hezbollah, leading to a deadly month-long war in 2006, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=275.52s)]
*  which ended via a UN-brokered ceasefire. Under the terms of that ceasefire, which is known as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=281.68s)]
*  and plays a big part in the current ceasefire, Israel and Hezbollah would halt hostilities. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel would withdraw from Lebanon entirely. Hezbollah would be disarmed, and Hezbollah would also withdraw to north of the Latani River, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=297.68s)]
*  which runs about 20 miles north of the border. This is the Latani River right here. The Lebanese army and the United Nations force [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=306.56s)]
*  would then operate in that area, this buffer zone over here. Hezbollah notably did not disarm or leave southern Lebanon that time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=314.4s)]
*  And despite some isolated incidents and ongoing simmering tensions, the resolution overall kept things relatively calm between Lebanon and Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=322.88s)]
*  Until last year's October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel, when Hezbollah and Israel began daily back and forth strikes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=333.36s)]
*  The situation escalated dramatically starting this September, when Israel intensified its attacks, using everything from [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=340.32s)]
*  explosive-laden pagers and walkie-talkies to heavy missiles to target Hezbollah in and around Beirut, killing dozens of high-ranking officials, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=346.96s)]
*  including its powerful long-time leader, Hassan Nasrallah. And like in the case of the Hamas assassinations in Gaza, Israel's attacks on Hezbollah leaders [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=355.52s)]
*  also end up killing non-civilian combatants. Israel once again launched a ground invasion of Lebanon. Hezbollah intensified its attacks, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=365.44s)]
*  sending thousands of rockets into Israel, striking as far south as in Israel, as the central part of the country, including attacks near Tel Aviv. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=374.56s)]
*  Amid the escalation in violence, there was also an increase in calls for a return to that UN resolution 1701. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=384.4s)]
*  And that resolution does indeed provide the framework for the New Deal, which went into effect on Tuesday, and which includes a halt in hostilities, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=391.28s)]
*  a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon over the next 60 days, and Hezbollah withdrawing once again to north of the Latani River. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=400.56s)]
*  The Lebanese army and the UN will oversee this and monitor this area. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AF_7jPZkQ&t=409.44s)]
