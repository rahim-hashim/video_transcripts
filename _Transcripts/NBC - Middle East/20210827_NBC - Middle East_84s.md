# Bolton: Trump-Pompeo Negotiations ‘Delegitimized Afghan Government’
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ)
*  Let me ask you this final question with with in terms of President Trump when you when you came on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Board a lot of people were like wait a minute your your hawkish Trump's a dove and I remember you saying look you're gonna be there [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=5.24s)]
*  To give strategic advice to to him [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  How what advice did you give him about how to withdraw he wanted to withdraw you didn't? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=13.8s)]
*  Did you give him advice on how you would do it even though you were against it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=19.28s)]
*  No, I gave him advice on how to maintain a minimal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=24.16s)]
*  Military presence below what I would have preferred but enough to hold on [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  to support a lot of other activities that were also being undertaken in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=32.8s)]
*  Afghanistan in order to avoid what I thought would have been the catastrophic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=39.04s)]
*  Consequences of complete withdrawal. I do think there's a distinction between the decision to withdraw and the way the withdrawal is being executed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  I don't think there's any question [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=51.88s)]
*  But I think fundamentally at bottom here what the Trump administration did the Trump Pompeo negotiating model [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=53.24s)]
*  delegitimize the Afghan government the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=61.56s)]
*  Negotiations were conducted essentially only with Taliban and by delegitimizing the Afghan government in effect almost by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=63.92s)]
*  De-recognizing it you told the army which was supposed to protect that government that its efforts were futile [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=72.48s)]
*  So there's no no real surprise to me that the army collapsed when Biden finally pulled the plug [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-mfLX0xpQ&t=78.66s)]
