# Trump warns Iran: Retaliate and be met with 'force far greater' than bombings
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M)
*  Hey, Nicole, good to be with you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, we should let you know that the president just issued a new statement that I think is [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=1.96s)]
*  notable given some of the conversation that you have just been having about maybe some [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=6.24s)]
*  of the items that were left out of his remarks but that are all the more relevant. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=10.28s)]
*  He did just say that any retaliation by Iran against the United States of America will [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=15.16s)]
*  be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=24.12s)]
*  So when we talk about where this goes from here, the potential future implications and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=25.88s)]
*  what it could mean for U.S. military personnel stationed in the region and around the world [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=30.64s)]
*  or for potentially whatever could be at risk here domestically and however Iran chooses [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  to respond to this, the president trying to emphasize that point with his messaging on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=42.34s)]
*  social media tonight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=47.56s)]
*  And we've been talking about this and I've been talking to my sources about this, Nicole, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=49.06s)]
*  of how this is all going to reverberate politically. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=53.68s)]
*  We're seeing one of the first calls for potential impeachment from a member of Congress, someone [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=56.8s)]
*  who has been a very outspoken critic of this president, from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=62.66s)]
*  And she wrote in a statement tonight that the president's, quote, disastrous decision [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=69.48s)]
*  to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=73.74s)]
*  war powers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=78.62s)]
*  He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=79.62s)]
*  And again, she says it's absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment and that she would [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=84.94s)]
*  have more soon to share. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=89.5s)]
*  So that's a question now, too, for lawmakers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=91.22s)]
*  And given your conversation just now with Congressman Ro Khanna, one that I think will [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  be put to a bunch of people now about whether this is something that they could go and pursue [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=98.22s)]
*  Again, as a reminder to our viewers, in his first term, President Trump was faced with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=104.9s)]
*  impeachment twice. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=111.26s)]
*  So the question of whether this would happen again in a third term is an open one. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  But this idea of whether he was in his authority or not to do this is certainly one that, again, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=116.7s)]
*  politically will be played out and debated among his supporters and among those in the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=122.78s)]
*  halls of Congress. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=127.62s)]
*  But overall, I think, Nicole, remember that in just a couple of days, the president is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  supposed to be heading to the NATO summit overseas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=134.02s)]
*  He was at the G7 a couple of days ago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=138.06s)]
*  He cut that short. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=141.34s)]
*  He left early to return to Washington to monitor the situation in the Middle East. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=142.34s)]
*  So the other major question that we're going to be pushing our sources on is how this plays [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=147.02s)]
*  on the world stage and with world leaders. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=152.44s)]
*  And we know there had been a major push for diplomacy as recently as yesterday when those [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=154.5s)]
*  European officials were huddling with Iranian officials and where our own Andrea Mitchell [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=159.02s)]
*  was speaking with the Iranian foreign minister to try to see if that opportunity could yield [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  anything. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=169.3s)]
*  And now that's, of course, the major question, too. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=170.3s)]
*  I'm told by a senior White House official that the president does believe there could [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  be a window here to resume some of these talks. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  But there are plenty of others who have expressed a lot of doubt over that, of course, given [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  how volatile this is now that the U.S. has entered. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=185.38s)]
*  This war between Israel and Iran. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=188.9s)]
*  Nicole. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  Monica, there's nothing normal about the way foreign policy seems to have been hatched [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=192.26000000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  But one of the things that a White House sometimes does is call in the press. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any sense that some of the White House's closest allies in the press, people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=207.9s)]
*  who have turned on this president over this issue, people like Tucker Carlson, were brought [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=214.06s)]
*  in tonight or touched with a plea to either stop with the attacks or mute their criticism? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=220.02s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=227.22s)]
*  And we know in the last couple of days there certainly have been questions to the president [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=228.74s)]
*  about that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=232.54s)]
*  We know he was following, for instance, the heated conversation between Senator Ted Cruz [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=233.54s)]
*  and Tucker Carlson pretty closely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=238.22s)]
*  But one of the first calls that he made when, after these strikes had concluded, we understand, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=240.58s)]
*  was to Sean Hannity of Fox News, who led one of his hours with that and saying that he [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  had just spoken to the president about this and who had a really broad message and sort [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=251.78s)]
*  of laid out the narrative for taking this military action before the president really [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=255.78s)]
*  had an opportunity to. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=261.46000000000004s)]
*  So I think that this is a White House that was thinking about that, but this is also [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=262.74s)]
*  often calls up his own allies and certainly those at Fox News that he is still quite close [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=266.9s)]
*  with with a lot of frequency because he knows that's how he can get to his audience and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=273.78s)]
*  to his supporters fairly quickly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=277.9s)]
*  But to your question about how this might be communicated, he spoke with a couple of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=280.17999999999995s)]
*  other high profile anchors. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=284.26s)]
*  He of course spoke briefly with our own colleague, moderator of Meet the Press, Kristen Welker, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=285.97999999999996s)]
*  this evening. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=289.82s)]
*  This is a president who they certainly do think about maybe the communication strategy, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=290.82s)]
*  but he is the communication strategy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=295.22s)]
*  He decides what he wants to share, how he wants to share it, who he wants to share it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=297.54s)]
*  with. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  And I think tomorrow will be a really key window into how some of these Republican divides [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  over this military action will play out and how he will have to continue to try to make [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=308.18s)]
*  the case for why he did it and continually defend it in a way that even just a couple [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=314.54s)]
*  of days ago, a week ago, his own secretary of state, some of his top officials were saying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=319.94000000000005s)]
*  this is not for the U.S. to get involved in, that the U.S. will continue to help Israel [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=324.38s)]
*  defend itself, but that this would not be something where the U.S. would be plunged [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=328.54s)]
*  into further military entanglement overseas, something of course that we know Donald Trump [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=332.66s)]
*  as a candidate said he pledged not to do, that he pledged to be a peacemaker. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  But he has also continually said, and this is what his allies have tried to amplify, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  that he believes he can bring forth peace through great strength. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=346.06s)]
*  And I think that's what you're going to continue to hear them point to and argue and have [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=350.7s)]
*  to continue to defend, of course. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=355.02s)]
*  Nicole? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=356.78s)]
*  Monica, thank you so much for being part of our coverage tonight. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3wvxSqu5M&t=357.78s)]
