# ‘Moment of opportunity’ for U.S. and Israel to get Hezbollah out of Lebanon: Jeremy Bash
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM)
*  And Jeremy Bash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=0.0s)]
*  So, as you know, the hostage families have been critical, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=1.6s)]
*  that the prime minister has not focused enough attention. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=5.96s)]
*  You know, hostage release now, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=9.0s)]
*  worry about the rest of the region [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=10.8s)]
*  and accomplishing his larger goals, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  if military goals later, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  and that's been their frustration, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=17.84s)]
*  especially since renewing all of the effort in Gaza [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=19.44s)]
*  and these new initiatives in Hezbollah, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=22.88s)]
*  which are very popular against the northern threat. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=25.44s)]
*  Netanyahu has now yielded to very strong pressure from the US [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=30.96s)]
*  not to go after the nuclear in this round. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=35.84s)]
*  They expect there's going to be a series of retaliations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=37.76s)]
*  And Iran is acknowledging this so-called restraint, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=40.68s)]
*  and so maybe the dire prospects for a larger war with Iran [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  will not come to pass. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=48.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think it makes sense for the Israeli government, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=50.72s)]
*  the IDF, to control escalation dominance. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  And by that, I mean, let them go after certain targets [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  that directly implicate the threat against Israel today, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=59.8s)]
*  the ballistic missiles, the drones, the cruise missiles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=63.52s)]
*  Those are the weapons that Iran fired at Israel on April 13th [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=67.08s)]
*  and again on October 1st. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=70.64s)]
*  Strengthen the coalition of countries [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  that came together to defend Israel, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=74.72s)]
*  including at the center of it, the United States. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=76.12s)]
*  Put in place in the region missile defense systems, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=78.92s)]
*  like FAD, as you mentioned earlier, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=81.84s)]
*  that the United States is now fielding, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=83.88s)]
*  along with US service members [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=85.2s)]
*  who can operate those missile defense batteries, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=87.12s)]
*  and then down the road, if Iran doesn't get the message [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=89.64s)]
*  and Iran is not deterred, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  it leaves further options on the table [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=93.52s)]
*  to go after nuclear and other energy targets. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=95.36s)]
*  And Israel certainly feels, Netanyahu [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=97.8s)]
*  and certainly his cabinet feel, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  that they have restored deterrence [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=102.64s)]
*  after the disasters of October 7th [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=104.56s)]
*  when they were completely taken by surprise [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  and responded slowly and ineffectively, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=108.52s)]
*  and that with the pager and walkie-talkie explosions, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=111.8s)]
*  with the assassinations in Tehran, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  which were very provocative, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=119.56s)]
*  according to the hostage negotiators, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=120.76s)]
*  and Nasrallah and Hezbollah, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  that they have proved their ability [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=125.2s)]
*  with cyber and other ways of managing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=128.0s)]
*  and going after Hezbollah as effectively as they have, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=131.24s)]
*  which is very popular, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=133.68s)]
*  unlike the Gaza operation in these last few months. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=134.8s)]
*  At this point, what do you think Israel's goals are? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=138.04s)]
*  Because Netanyahu and other officials [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  have talked about they're facing an existential threat, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=148.4s)]
*  and they see a real window here, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  a window where they have done great damage to Hezbollah, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=154.0s)]
*  which was the insurance policy to Tehran, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=158.48s)]
*  and why not go after Tehran, which is their enemy? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=160.84s)]
*  Can they accomplish what they want to do [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=167.12s)]
*  in the nuclear field if they had to? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=169.44s)]
*  Without U.S. help? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, Israel, America's allies, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=173.04s)]
*  under fire from four different directions, Andrea, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  not only from Hamas and Gaza, but from the West Bank, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  but also from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=179.88s)]
*  And so, from Israel's perspective, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=182.92s)]
*  they had to defang Iran's terrorist capability [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  on its northern border. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=191.04s)]
*  That was Hezbollah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think the IDF even surprised itself [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=192.92s)]
*  with how it was able to marry pristine intelligence [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=195.56s)]
*  with kinetic strikes and take out Iran's nuclear weapons. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  And so, it's a takeout, wipe out Hezbollah's leadership. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=202.44s)]
*  But let's take stock of where we are in Lebanon, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  because as referenced earlier, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=208.6s)]
*  there are a lot of Americans who've got family in Lebanon. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=210.16s)]
*  There are a lot of Lebanese Americans [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=212.76s)]
*  who are watching this situation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  And here's what I would say is, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=215.92s)]
*  I think implementation of the UN Resolution 1701 [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  is the right formula. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  It's the way to get Hezbollah out of Lebanon. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=222.2s)]
*  It's the way to get Israeli families- [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=224.88s)]
*  Well, that's what the U.S. is calling for. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  But my reporting is also that there are a lot of risks there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  to stand up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=231.28s)]
*  The Lebanese government is so weak, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=232.08s)]
*  and Hezbollah is so resilient. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=233.88s)]
*  Even the remaining leaders are very heavily armed. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  And we, the United States, are going to have to continue [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=239.68s)]
*  to partner with the Lebanese government. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=241.36s)]
*  They are an important partner here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  But this is a moment of opportunity here [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  for Israel and the United States [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=246.96s)]
*  to get Hezbollah out of the politics of Lebanon, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  to use these tactical and strategic victories [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=251.44s)]
*  to really drive a political situation in Lebanon. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  We don't want Lebanon to be on fire. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=257.24s)]
*  We want Israeli families to move back to Kiryat Shemona, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=258.92s)]
*  to Metulla, to the towns in the Northern Galilee, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=262.44s)]
*  where they've been displaced since October 8th, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  since Hezbollah joined this war against Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=267.92s)]
*  And our NBC News reporting is also that the U.S. now, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=269.76s)]
*  having called for a ceasefire internationally, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=274.12s)]
*  and that was rejected initially, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=276.88s)]
*  they see a potential advantage [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=279.76s)]
*  because they're upset with the United Nations peacekeepers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=281.76s)]
*  for letting these weapons be buried in tunnels [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=285.12s)]
*  right under their feet. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=287.92s)]
*  And for being so ineffective, but they're not armed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=288.84s)]
*  So they're up against Hezbollah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=290.84s)]
*  The U.N. has not done its job. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  So it's going to fall again to the United States, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  our partners and allies in the region, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  to work together to make sure that Lebanon [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  has a free and prosperous future, free of Hezbollah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=298.32s)]
*  And I think there is going to be discussion [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=302.08s)]
*  on the campaign trail, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=304.12s)]
*  distinction between Vice President Harris, Donald Trump, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=305.08s)]
*  on the future of the Middle East, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=307.76s)]
*  on the future of Lebanon. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=308.76s)]
*  One quick question, because everyone wants to know this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  What is the timing of Israel's attack against Iran? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=311.55999999999995s)]
*  Everyone assumes it'll be before the election, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=314.96s)]
*  but right now, will they wait from your vast knowledge [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=317.36s)]
*  until THAAD, this new defense system, is fully operational? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  And how long will that take? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=327.24s)]
*  I think it could be a matter of days or weeks, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  but I don't expect that they will wait too long. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoGM6V5MvM&t=331.28000000000003s)]
