# What is next for Syria's government? U.S. should be 'cautious' with involvement
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc)
*  Moving to Syria, will the rebel leaders there live up to their promise to create an inclusive, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=0.0s)]
*  multiethnic, multi-religious government, or will they revert to their terrorist roots? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=5.66s)]
*  Joining us now is retired four-star General Joseph Votel, the former commander of U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=9.74s)]
*  Central Command, now a distinguished senior fellow on national security at the Middle [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=15.14s)]
*  East Institute. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=19.46s)]
*  General Votel, thanks very much for being with us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=20.46s)]
*  Jake Sullivan said today that there is some opportunity, obviously, in Syria with the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=23.46s)]
*  fall of the butcher Assad, but there are enormous risks of the resurgence of ISIS. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=29.2s)]
*  How concerned are you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=36.08s)]
*  Well, I think everyone should be concerned about terrorist organizations that rise up [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=37.08s)]
*  into these positions. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=42.64s)]
*  That said, what we've seen is, over the last week or so, is we've seen fairly moderate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=45.14s)]
*  actions from them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  And having just returned from the region, what I've been asking this question, a number [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=51.16s)]
*  of our partners over there, they're watching this very closely. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=55.6s)]
*  So they will be looking at what the next 90-day agenda looks like. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=58.84s)]
*  They'll be looking at how they apply some of the principles that were discussed in Aqaba [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  last week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  And they'll be looking at how they approach multiparty discussions. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  So Mr. Jelani has said a lot, but we really need to see actions on his part before we [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=71.58s)]
*  begin to make different judgments about HTS. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=77.5s)]
*  How quickly do you think, if he persists in his moderate stance, his inclusive stance, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=81.94s)]
*  he's abandoned his previous uniform, he's in civilian dress, how quickly should we delist [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=87.44s)]
*  him as a terrorist, which he is, according to us in the United Nations? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=94.72s)]
*  And should we be on the ground, which is a big issue? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=100.76s)]
*  The French and the Brits are going in. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think right now, I'm not sure our classification of HTS as a terrorist organization [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=105.6s)]
*  is preventing him from doing what he needs to do on the ground here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  Certainly it is limiting some of our interaction with him. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  We can make that call whenever we want. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=123.1s)]
*  I do think it's important to be cautious here and to make sure that we are seeing a continuation [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  of moderate stances by Mr. Jelani, by HTS, by the interim government as they move forward [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=131.94s)]
*  here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=139.42s)]
*  Whether we should be on the ground or not, that's really kind of a political decision. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=140.48s)]
*  We don't actually have to be on the ground to communicate with them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=144.44s)]
*  I do recognize some other Western powers have gone in there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=147.2s)]
*  I think being a bit cautious, I think, is probably the right approach at this point. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3PJkBtMoc&t=150.79999999999998s)]
