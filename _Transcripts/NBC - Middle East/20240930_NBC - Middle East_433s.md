# Polymeropoulos: ‘Iran is certainly reeling and still unsure what they're going to do’
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y)
*  And, Mark, Iran is certainly shaken by the death of Nasrallah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And mixed views, because Hezbollah is part of their government, controls a lot of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=10.26s)]
*  But there was a lot of resentment also in some of the other areas of Lebanon against [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=11.26s)]
*  Nasrallah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=16.56s)]
*  And certainly, Iran is shaken by it, because Hezbollah was their insurance policy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=19.2s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=25.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=27.8s)]
*  Iran saw Hezbollah, think of it almost as a forward-deployed base or as an aircraft [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=28.8s)]
*  carrier battle group sitting on the border with Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=33.56s)]
*  And it was really as a deterrent for an Israeli military strike against the Iranian nuclear [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=36.6s)]
*  facilities. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  And right now, that aircraft carrier battle group is sinking. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  So Iran has a choice right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=45.06s)]
*  Do they want to escalate in some sense, to retaliate, try to save Hezbollah in that fashion? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=46.84s)]
*  for a diplomatic solution and really have Hezbollah live to fight another day. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=55.2s)]
*  It is very notable that we've seen reporting that Israel has asked the United States, through [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=60.96s)]
*  our own channels, to tell Iran not to do anything. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=65.04s)]
*  And also, there was this strike yesterday by the Israeli Air Force in Yemen, a strike [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=68.44s)]
*  that was certainly in retaliation for the Houthis firing ballistic missiles at Israel, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=73.2s)]
*  but also a clear message to Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=78.72s)]
*  Remember, the Israelis put out on social media videos of refueling capabilities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=80.84s)]
*  That's a long-range capacity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  That's a message to Iran as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=88.56s)]
*  So Iran is certainly reeling. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  It's still unsure what they're going to do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=91.92s)]
*  They do, however, seem to be in a state of paralysis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  And perhaps they're just allowing Hezbollah and the Lebanese fight just to the last dead [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  Lebanese rather than Iran kind of jumping into the fray. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  In Lebanon, as I was saying, Iran is, of course, shaken by this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=105.72s)]
*  In Lebanon, there's mixed feelings because Hezbollah has been controlling them militarily. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=111.44s)]
*  They're in the parliament. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  They're elected members. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  And they've also provided food and aid to people after the last war. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  But there are lots of parts of Lebanon that do not support Hezbollah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=125.56s)]
*  Certainly, Hezbollah has been guilty of killing hundreds and hundreds of Americans as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  So you've heard the very moderate public comments from the president, from the secretary, even [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=136.52s)]
*  though they feel that they should have been warned. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=144.84s)]
*  Well, look, I worked counterterrorism for many years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=147.12s)]
*  Up until 9-11, Hezbollah was the terrorist organization that had killed more Americans [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=151.08s)]
*  than any other group. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  There are CIA officers, diplomats, 241 American servicemen and women as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  But don't forget, Hezbollah was also responsible for the deaths of thousands of Syrians, thousands [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=161.08s)]
*  of Lebanese. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=166.84s)]
*  And so you do see, in many parts of the Arab world, particularly the Sunni Arab world, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=168.4s)]
*  rejoicing at Nasrallah's death. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=173.44s)]
*  And so there is some hope, and you always try to find opportunity, that perhaps Lebanon [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  can get back on its feet now because the Israelis are taking care of business against Hezbollah [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  for their own interests. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  But also perhaps the Lebanese themselves can kind of rid themselves of this cancer. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=189.56s)]
*  Nasrallah was very unpopular in Lebanon over the last several years, whether it was responsibility [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  for the death of former Prime Minister Hariri, the port explosion, the rampant corruption, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  and of course the Hezbollah entry into the Syrian civil war, which led to the death, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=206.72s)]
*  again, of thousands of other Sunni Arabs. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=211.4s)]
*  Final point, Andrea. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=214.32s)]
*  Really there's quiet from Sunni Arab allies, such as the Saudis and the Emiratis. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=216.52s)]
*  I think at the end of the day they are thinking this might be a very positive development [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  And to that point, thank you, Mark. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  And joining us now is Richard Haas, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=228.84s)]
*  Could the death of Nasrallah reshape the region? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  It certainly has weakened Iran, and we have yet to see what kind of Iranian response that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=237.8s)]
*  will be. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=242.08s)]
*  But if Lebanon could take hold of its own country again, after its prime minister, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=243.08s)]
*  as Hariri was, as you point out, President Hariri, was killed by Hezbollah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  You'd have to be a wild optimist to think the Middle East will be reshaped as a result [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=254.44s)]
*  of anything. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=259.32s)]
*  Look, this is, I think, lots of positive developments here, I would argue. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=260.32s)]
*  But this, to use a baseball analogy, this might be the second or third inning. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=265.24s)]
*  We've got to see how the game plays out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  But no, it's not going to reshape the region. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  You still have all the dynamics between Israelis and Palestinians, all the dynamics between [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  Iran and the Sunni states, internal instability, or the potential for it or the reality of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=279.96s)]
*  it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=286.08s)]
*  Plus Lebanon, quite honestly, is a plurality or majority Shia country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=287.08s)]
*  The state institutions are unbelievably weak. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=291.88s)]
*  So it's going to be a weak state with or without Hezbollah in its midst. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=295.2s)]
*  And, Richard, President Biden was asked about the possibility of an Israeli ground invasion. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=301.04s)]
*  Take a look at what he said today. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=306.24s)]
*  The fact that Israel may be now launching a limited operation into Lebanon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=309.8s)]
*  Are you aware of that? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  Are you comfortable with their plans? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm more aware than you might know, and I'm comfortable with them stopping. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=316.36s)]
*  We should have a ceasefire now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=320.72s)]
*  So there's this real disconnect. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=324.24s)]
*  At this point, they didn't know about the American administration, did not know about [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=326.76s)]
*  the pagers. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  They didn't know about the assassination of Fania in Tehran. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  They've been blindsided so many times by Israel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=336.2s)]
*  What is the relationship like? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=339.32s)]
*  I think there's two separate issues here, Andrea. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=340.32s)]
*  Israel clearly prefers asking for forgiveness rather than permission. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=344.52s)]
*  And you could make the case that this relationship is not sufficiently reciprocal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=348.84s)]
*  If you look at what's happened over the last year in Gaza in particular, Israel essentially [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=353.36s)]
*  rebuffed, rejected most American advice or entreaties. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  So that's a legitimate area where I think the United States and Israel need to have [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=363.2s)]
*  something of a heart-to-heart about how this relationship ought to function. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  Where I disagree with the president is I don't think calls for a ceasefire now make a whole [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=373.24s)]
*  lot of sense. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=378.44s)]
*  They're not going to happen, first of all. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=379.44s)]
*  I never like it when the United States calls for things that it can't deliver. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=381.04s)]
*  But also, I think Israel has a lot of legitimacy on its side in taking on Hezbollah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=385.04s)]
*  We can debate how it should be done militarily. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=390.04s)]
*  But I think from the air, with covert operations, with the ground dimension makes sense. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=393.0s)]
*  No country should have to live with the sort of threat that Hezbollah poses against Israel. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=398.02000000000004s)]
*  So I don't quite understand why the administration is coming down so hard in favor of a ceasefire [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=403.98s)]
*  on that front in the Middle East. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboOxoBNC1Y&t=410.4s)]
