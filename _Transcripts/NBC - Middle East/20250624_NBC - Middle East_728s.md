# Iranians ‘at the end of the rope’: Fmr. U.S. Amb. to NATO reacts to ceasefire
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA)
*  Garrett, so what are the president and his administration doing right now to try to keep [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=0.0s)]
*  this ceasefire from falling apart? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=4.4s)]
*  Well, Chris, they're using a heavy dose of the president's social media feed to try to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  reshape the narrative around the ceasefire itself. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=11.88s)]
*  The president's suggesting this was something that both sides very much wanted, taking credit [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=14.52s)]
*  for making this happen, including by destroying Iran's nuclear program entirely, he says, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=18.48s)]
*  as he said in the South Lawn this morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=24.98s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=26.32s)]
*  Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=27.32s)]
*  From there? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=31.8s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=32.8s)]
*  That place is under rock. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=33.8s)]
*  That place is demolished. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=35.8s)]
*  The B-2 pilots did their job. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=36.8s)]
*  They did it better than anybody could even imagine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=39.52s)]
*  They hit late in the evening. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=41.84s)]
*  It was dark with no moon, and they hit that target with every one of those things, and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=43.64s)]
*  that place is gone. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=48.8s)]
*  Enforcing the ceasefire also seeming to involve a pretty heavy dose of Donald Trump himself [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  in that same exchange from the South Lawn. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=57.3s)]
*  He said he had heard about Israeli jets on their way to Iran to hit other targets. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=59.5s)]
*  Then once he was on Air Force One, called Prime Minister Netanyahu to call off those [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=65.14s)]
*  jets afterwards, posting again on Truth Social that he had succeeded and that the targets [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  would only receive a friendly plane wave. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=74.74s)]
*  Chris? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=77.7s)]
*  So, Matt, take me to the region. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=78.7s)]
*  Is there confidence this ceasefire can last, or even the belief that it should? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=80.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when we all went to bed last night believing that there was going to be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=87.42s)]
*  a ceasefire, we were awoken in the early hours of the morning by not one, not two, but three [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=91.42s)]
*  sirens sounding all over here in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=97.86s)]
*  Now, we understand from emergency workers that four people were killed in the southern [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=100.22s)]
*  city of Beersheba. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=104.34s)]
*  But in my conversations with people who are close to the government, it sounds as though [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=106.06s)]
*  there is absolute confidence that this is it, that the war is over, and that this truce [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=109.9s)]
*  will hold. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  Now, that is still an open question, of course. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  We don't know whether or not this is going to hold because we haven't seen it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  We saw this shaky truce taking effect in the morning with tit for tat firing by the Iranians [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=123.78s)]
*  and the Israelis. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=128.54s)]
*  The Israeli military said this morning that basically that they had fired shortly before [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=130.26s)]
*  the ceasefire was supposed to take effect and that the Iranians fired around the time [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=135.62s)]
*  or shortly after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=140.18s)]
*  And from my understanding, it is all true that the president phoned up the government [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=144.58s)]
*  here and got those jets from the Israelis to turn around. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=148.58s)]
*  The Israelis did say that they struck some sites near Tehran outside of Iran's capital. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=152.54s)]
*  But it looks like for now, despite that back and forth, and we are about an hour into that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=159.26s)]
*  12-hour mark when the Israelis were supposed to respect the ceasefire as well, it looks [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=163.26s)]
*  like so far this is holding. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=169.62s)]
*  So, Garrett, we know the president isn't necessarily big on these global summits. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=171.58s)]
*  In fact, he is supposed to be headed back to the White House tomorrow. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=175.94s)]
*  And we remember he left the G7 early. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=179.86s)]
*  So what can you tell us about the dynamic going into these meetings and what the hopes [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=182.74s)]
*  are that something substantive might be accomplished? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=187.94s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, not a big fan of these kinds of summits, not a big fan of these kinds of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=193.58s)]
*  summits with the Europeans specifically. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=196.82s)]
*  The president is only going to be on the ground for about 24 hours here in the Netherlands. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=198.9s)]
*  But there may still be one substantive takeaway, and that's the plan at NATO to raise the defense [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=203.22s)]
*  spending target for member nations from the current 2 percent to 5 percent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=208.9s)]
*  It seems as though, according to the NATO secretary general, that there is sufficient [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=213.1s)]
*  buy-in from the rest of the countries in the alliance to make that happen. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=216.74s)]
*  Of course, I'll remind you, it is only a target, only about two-thirds of NATO countries currently [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=220.5s)]
*  hit the 2 percent target. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  The president has long complained that Europe in particular needs to do more for its own [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  defense. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=230.66s)]
*  Europe appears ready to give him that victory in this short visit here to the Netherlands. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=231.66s)]
*  Garrett Haig, Matt Bradley, thank you both so much. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=236.18s)]
*  Right now I'm joined by a man who spent years front and center at summits like the one that's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  being held in The Hague. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  Ivo Dalder was the U.S. ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=244.9s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, it's so good to see you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=250.3s)]
*  How would you describe what the president has been doing over the last 12 hours as we [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  set the stage for what's to come? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=257.82s)]
*  Is it diplomacy or is it something else? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=260.42s)]
*  It's brow-beating your allies and friends in order to do what you want them to do. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=264.34s)]
*  I mean, clearly the strike that was launched over the weekend was something that only the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=268.42s)]
*  United States could do. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=273.46s)]
*  It was something that Benjamin Netanyahu tried the United States to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=275.3s)]
*  Trump did decide to strike. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=279.26s)]
*  We still don't know, despite what the president has said, the effect of those strikes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=282.1s)]
*  Has the nuclear program completely been destroyed, particularly that deep underground enrichment [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=287.1s)]
*  facility in Fort Oh Mountain? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=292.26000000000005s)]
*  What about the material that was already enriched to 60 percent, sufficient with a little bit [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=294.22s)]
*  more enrichment to create nine to 10 nuclear bombs worth of materials? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  We don't know the outcome of that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=306.3s)]
*  But clearly the Israelis weren't able to do anything more once the United States went [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=308.02s)]
*  in and the Iranians, frankly, were at the end of the rope. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  So I think he just was able to convince two parties that wanted to stop fighting, stop [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=316.85999999999996s)]
*  the fighting. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting today that Trump caught even some of his own top officials [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=324.26s)]
*  off guard when he announced the ceasefire in an online post. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=328.74s)]
*  We don't know if he talked with any European leaders. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=333.02s)]
*  We haven't heard that, even though they were negotiating with Iran, we know at least as [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=335.34s)]
*  recently as Friday. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  What is the role of allies if this kind of ceasefire can stick? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's obviously critically important as he heads to a place where they're all going [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=346.02s)]
*  to be together. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=350.56s)]
*  Well the United States under Donald Trump doesn't really believe in allies anymore. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=353.05999999999995s)]
*  In fact, he was quite explicit that the Europeans should not be negotiating, which they tried [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=356.7s)]
*  to do. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=361.52s)]
*  He was talking to Europeans way back, something like 20 some years ago, that started the negotiations [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=362.52s)]
*  that ultimately led to the Iranian nuclear agreement that was signed and implemented [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=367.84s)]
*  under the Obama administration. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump walked away from that agreement. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Had he not done that, we wouldn't be in the place that we are where we have to use military [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=377.84s)]
*  force to destroy a program and not really knowing whether in fact we were able to destroy [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=388.32s)]
*  That's water under the bridge. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=389.32s)]
*  Here's the reality that he will face, I think, at NATO and other places. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=390.72s)]
*  He will find that there's sometimes the United States can act by itself. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=396.12s)]
*  And clearly, when you are the only country with B-2 bombers and bunker busters like we [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=399.48s)]
*  have, then sometimes only the United States can affect what needs to be done. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=405.36s)]
*  But most of the time, you want allies. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  You want friends. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  You want partners to deal with countries like Russia, more importantly even countries like [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  economically and militarily effectively with them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=417.56s)]
*  And you will find that when you try to do it all by yourself, you just can't get it [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=420.72s)]
*  done. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=424.12s)]
*  And that's why the United States has spent the last 80 years building up these alliances, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=425.4s)]
*  not just to have them on standby at every moment, but to make sure that you have friends [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=430.64s)]
*  if and when you need them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=437.18s)]
*  That is what these alliances are about. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=439.36s)]
*  Not because you want them to pay for you to defend them or let alone start trade wars [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=441.84s)]
*  with them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=448.84s)]
*  No, you want allies because they are the countries that make you strong. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=449.84s)]
*  We, unlike the Chinese, have allies. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=454.12s)]
*  We don't have clients. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=456.76s)]
*  We have allies. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=457.76s)]
*  And I'm afraid that the Trump administration is trying too much to do by itself, not enough [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=458.96s)]
*  with its allies, and alienating them with tariffs and the kind of language that we've [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=464.96s)]
*  seen by the president now addressed to Israel, which after all is a close, a close partner [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=469.92s)]
*  and friend of the United States as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=476.48s)]
*  So this summit, of course, was supposed to be all about strengthening NATO, specifically [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=479.4s)]
*  getting other countries to commit to more defense spending. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  And the current U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, released this video just yesterday [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=486.92s)]
*  speaking exactly to that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=492.14s)]
*  My team and I have been working around the clock to prepare for the summit in The Hague. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=496.36s)]
*  And let me tell you, this one's a game changer. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  This year, we're laser focused. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=504.68s)]
*  Five percent. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=507.48s)]
*  That's the headline. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=509.24s)]
*  That's the mission. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=510.58000000000004s)]
*  Five percent of GDP for defense. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=511.58000000000004s)]
*  Not just spending, but building real capability, real deterrence and real power. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=514.08s)]
*  As is being reported, most of the nations are ready to sign on, whether because Vladimir [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=522.52s)]
*  Putin has pushed them to up their own defenses or they simply want to appease Donald Trump. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  If he believes he has forced a win, do you think that could possibly make him more amenable [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=533.52s)]
*  potentially to their priorities? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=539.52s)]
*  Does it give them any more leverage? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=541.16s)]
*  Well, you'd hope so, but that's not the way that Donald Trump operates. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=543.12s)]
*  I mean, clearly this is a game changer. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=547.76s)]
*  It is very important. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=550.12s)]
*  It is important for the Europeans to spend not five percent, actually three and a half [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=551.68s)]
*  percent on real defense capabilities. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=555.56s)]
*  And that will be enough for the Europeans to really take the primary responsibility [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=558.9399999999999s)]
*  for their own defense. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  But let's be clear why they're doing that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=565.92s)]
*  They're not doing it because Donald Trump or even Ambassador Whitaker told them to do [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=571.68s)]
*  They're doing it for two reasons. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=572.68s)]
*  Number one, because Russia has turned in the last three years its economy into a war economy [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=573.68s)]
*  and will only be able to continue to survive as long as it spends the extraordinary amounts [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=579.6s)]
*  of money to buy military equipment at a rate that we haven't seen since the Cold War. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  That's one reason. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=592.96s)]
*  There's a real threat. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=593.96s)]
*  And the second reason is because under President Trump, there has been doubt created in Europe [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=595.0s)]
*  so about whether the United States will in fact come to the defense of Europe. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=600.96s)]
*  And Europeans are now spending more on defense not only to meet the Russian threat but also [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=606.14s)]
*  to prepare for the possible eventuality of the United States no longer being willing [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=610.26s)]
*  to defend them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=614.78s)]
*  And that is the reality. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=616.78s)]
*  That's why this is happening. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=618.3s)]
*  Now, I think it's important. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=619.3s)]
*  I think the President should take this as a win. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=620.8199999999999s)]
*  And I hope that because he got the win, he will now also recommit to Europe and to its [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=624.78s)]
*  defense, to recommit to maintain the commanders, to make sure they're Americans, that the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=630.74s)]
*  nuclear deterrent that the United States provides to the alliance remains strong and credible. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=636.7s)]
*  All of that I hope will continue to be there. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=642.26s)]
*  But the Hague is fundamentally... [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=645.7s)]
*  I don't want to interrupt you, but I note you said hope several times. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=646.7s)]
*  What is your expectation? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=650.5s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump for 40 years has not believed in alliances, so I don't think that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=652.82s)]
*  at age 79 he's likely to change. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, he's also not likely to undermine an alliance that has just given [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  him a particular win. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=665.26s)]
*  So what I hope that... [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=667.38s)]
*  And expect in many ways is that over the next few years you will find that the United States [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=669.34s)]
*  and Europe will engage in a transition in which Europeans will take on more and more [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=674.1800000000001s)]
*  responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=679.0600000000001s)]
*  That is a good thing. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=682.6600000000001s)]
*  We should all support it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=683.6600000000001s)]
*  It's something that has been necessary for a long time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=685.1s)]
*  And that we do so without the United States threatening to leave or indeed bullying our [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=688.38s)]
*  allies in the way that we've seen over the last few months. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=691.88s)]
*  So to Mr. President, take the win, go home, celebrate, and leave the alliance to do what [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=694.92s)]
*  it does best, work together among 32 countries to provide for the security of those 32 countries. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=701.2199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUvR4yRBeZA&t=717.92s)]
