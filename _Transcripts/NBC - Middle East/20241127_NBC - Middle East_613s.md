# Hezbollah 'still has significant missile capability' should ceasefire fail: Amb. Ginsburg
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg)
*  And Ambassador, let's taking a big picture look at this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=0.0s)]
*  How significant is this ceasefire? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=4.0s)]
*  Well, Jose, hello, it is very significant. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=8.16s)]
*  Let me give a shout out to special envoy Amos Hochstein, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=10.8s)]
*  who did a Herculean job cobbling together this ceasefire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=14.8s)]
*  What the Biden administration, of course, hopes is that this ceasefire, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  if it is durable and is able to preserve a return of civilians, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  not only from southern Lebanon, but also civilians back to their communities in northern Israel, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=28.64s)]
*  that it can leverage this to force Amos back to the negotiating table [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=35.6s)]
*  and reach some sort of ceasefire agreement in the south. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=40.64s)]
*  I'm skeptical whether that's possible. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=44.64s)]
*  Israel has already declared that it will not cease hostilities in Gaza, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  notwithstanding the cabinet's agreement to begin withdrawal of IDF forces from southern Lebanon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=51.92s)]
*  Number one and number two. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=58.64s)]
*  Ultimately, then the issue is what will Iran do to thwart the ceasefires? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=60.56s)]
*  All roads lead to Tehran, Jose, and until Tehran cease and resists [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=65.84s)]
*  further rearming, as Boa and Hamas, I'm afraid that this truce may not last very long. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=71.68s)]
*  Mike, yesterday, President Biden said the U.S. will help ensure this ceasefire is enforced. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=79.44s)]
*  What could that look like? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=85.44s)]
*  Well, Jose, a key part of the negotiations that led to this deal began, in fact, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=88.64s)]
*  just days before the presidential election here in the United States. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=93.92s)]
*  Amos Hoxdean, mentioned by the ambassador there, was summoned to Israel by the Prime Minister, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=98.24s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, to say essentially that after months of hard work diplomatically by [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=102.8s)]
*  the United States, not just to bring about a deal, but to prevent this situation from escalating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=107.76s)]
*  further, the prime minister said he saw a window of opportunity to get to that deal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=112.0s)]
*  So what followed was intensive negotiations that included a role for the French, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=115.84s)]
*  President Biden speaking on Friday by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron, to talk about [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=120.56s)]
*  the ways in which those two countries would add to an existing mechanism to be sort of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=125.04s)]
*  an intermediary should potential violations of this ceasefire occur. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=129.76s)]
*  Now, this is going to take 60 days to get into a place, but it's a part of a deal that the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=134.4s)]
*  president hopes is durable, as he laid out yesterday when he spoke about this from the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=139.04s)]
*  Rose Garden. Take a listen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=142.32s)]
*  Fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end, will end. This is designed to be a permanent [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  cessation of hostilities. If Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=153.36s)]
*  Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense consistent with international law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=158.72s)]
*  Now, the president making those comments just before leaving the White House to travel here [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=167.52s)]
*  to Nantucket. He also insisted that no U.S. boots would be on the ground, although U.S. officials [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=171.28s)]
*  later did say that they would play a role in offering assistance to the Lebanese army, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  which certainly needs that assistance. Now, we also learned this morning from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=180.16s)]
*  national security advisor Jake Sullivan that he was briefing the incoming Trump administration [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=184.16s)]
*  team about the parameters of this deal as it came together. Ultimately, it will fall to them if this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=188.72s)]
*  deal remains in place by the January 20th to continue to play that supporting role. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=193.84s)]
*  Ambassador, how much of a factor was Israel's systematic destruction of Hezbollah infrastructure [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=198.56s)]
*  in making this deal possible? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=206.4s)]
*  No doubt about it. And that is one of the reasons why there's such conjecture within [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=209.68s)]
*  the Israeli public whether or not the ceasefire deal was the right deal to do at this point in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=215.28s)]
*  time, because the IDF was already on the cusp of doing significant and major damage to Hezbollah's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=221.36s)]
*  military capability. But yet, at the same time, Hezbollah has been able to continue firing rockets [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=229.12s)]
*  from north of the Latani River into Israel. So while at the same time IDF has done significant [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=236.56s)]
*  destruction, Hezbollah still has significant missile capability to attack Israel should the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=242.96s)]
*  ceasefire fail. Mike, President Biden also spoke about the continued fighting between Israel and Hamas. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=249.6s)]
*  Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=259.92s)]
*  and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. With the hostages released and the end of the war without [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=267.2s)]
*  Hamas in power, that becomes possible. Does the White House see any real possibility of an Israel [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=273.84s)]
*  Hamas ceasefire and the return of the hostages? No doubt. Hezbollah is a big believer in... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And then ambassador. Actually, let me ask you, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=292.55999999999995s)]
*  Mike, to do that because, Ambassador, I have something I want to ask you in on behalf of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=298.0s)]
*  Mike's answer. Sure thing, Jose. Well, the White House is a significant believer in the power of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=302.88s)]
*  momentum, and they do hope that this is the beginning of further momentum in the region. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=311.28s)]
*  There has been no greater political toll, perhaps, on this administration over the past year than the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=315.68s)]
*  crisis in Gaza. And in 54 days, of course, the president is going to be continuing to devote his [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=321.6s)]
*  full effort, Jake Sullivan, saying that work begins this morning to get to that ceasefire [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  agreement. One of the reasons why there is optimism, Jose, is because a key breakthrough [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=331.44s)]
*  in getting to this agreement was that Hezbollah in Lebanon agreed to no longer delink a potential [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=336.32s)]
*  ceasefire with a similar arrangement in Gaza. To the U.S. officials, that means it only shows that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=341.92s)]
*  Hamas is further isolated in that situation. They have been the main barrier to an agreement, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=347.6s)]
*  and they think that now there will be continued progress. The other piece, Jose, that is so [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=352.88s)]
*  important to this administration, is getting input from other regional stakeholders to have a plan [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=356.56s)]
*  to rebuild Gaza after a ceasefire were to come into place. That is also a key ingredient of what [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=361.68s)]
*  the president hopes to do in his final weeks in office. And so, Ambassador, taking off of what [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=367.84s)]
*  Mike was just telling us and your comments earlier about the influence of Iran in all of this, they [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=372.88s)]
*  remain that same regime that has been in power since 1979 with the same objectives and mission [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=380.96s)]
*  What is there? Is there any possibility of any true peace or even recognition while Iran remains [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=388.56s)]
*  the same? No, there's no doubt that, unfortunately, the Biden administration never really had over its [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  four years a coherent policy on what to do about Iran's continuing terrorism, not only against [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  Israel, but against United States forces in the Middle East. And until Iran is forced to cease [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=410.72s)]
*  and desist, supporting the proxies that it created in order to destroy Israel, let alone, of course, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=417.28s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah, but also the Houthi rebels and the Shiite militias in Iraq, we're going to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=424.08s)]
*  have to push further for a far more sophisticated long-term policy to undermine the Iranian regime. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=430.64s)]
*  That's the only message that they'll understand, and that's the only way that Israel is going to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=438.55999999999995s)]
*  be able to have peace both on its northern border as well as in Gaza. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=443.28s)]
*  Hala, politically, where does Netanyahu stand? And is there any possibility that he could [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=450.0s)]
*  be in favor of some further movement with Hamas diplomatically? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  So it's not just Palestinians who occasionally will blame Prime Minister Netanyahu for moving [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=463.52s)]
*  the goalposts on any ceasefire negotiations with Gaza, but it's also Israelis themselves and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=470.8s)]
*  specifically the families of the hostages. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been seen internally and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=477.2s)]
*  throughout the region quite often as a leader who has gotten in the way of getting a ceasefire [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=482.88s)]
*  deal over the finish line. Yes, Hamas has been intransigent. Yes, there have been issues with [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  that organization, that terrorist organization, but there has been a lot of blame also leveled [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=494.88s)]
*  at Prime Minister Netanyahu. For example, I can give you a specific example. When there were [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=500.8s)]
*  ceasefire negotiations several months ago and one of the requests was for the IDF to evacuate what [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  is known as the Philadelphia Corridor, which is that strip of land that divides [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=514.96s)]
*  Rafah on the Egyptian side from Rafah on the Gaza side. And the Prime Minister was extremely [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=519.76s)]
*  unwilling to move on that, knowing that that would probably torpedo a ceasefire deal. Now, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  as far as whether he is willing to use the momentum that has been gained through this [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=534.0s)]
*  ceasefire deal with Hezbollah, well, we just need to listen to what the Prime Minister himself [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  told his countrymen and women yesterday in his address. And he said, for me, the war is not [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=546.4799999999999s)]
*  over, for Israel, the war is not over until we completely defeat Hamas. And completely defeating [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  Hamas is something that is an extremely tall order, as many military experts will tell you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=557.12s)]
*  As many military experts will tell you, a Hamas insurgency will continue for a long time, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=563.44s)]
*  even if the military rocket, if you will, capabilities of the group have been neutralized. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=569.92s)]
*  So there you have your answer sort of in a longer winded way perhaps than you would like. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=577.2s)]
*  But essentially, it seems very unlikely that there will be a ceasefire deal [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=585.44s)]
*  between Hamas and Israel at least in the next 54 days. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWfEm5v4tg&t=589.52s)]
