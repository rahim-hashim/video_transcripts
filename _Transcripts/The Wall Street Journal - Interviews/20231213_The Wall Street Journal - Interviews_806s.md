# Hakeem Jeffries on the 2024 Democratic Agenda | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M)
*  Leader Jeffries, thank you so much for being here. Let's jump right in. President Zelensky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=0.0s)]
*  is here today. I believe you met with him this morning. Can you look him in the eye [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=5.92s)]
*  and assure him that America still has Ukraine's back? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=10.32s)]
*  Well, good afternoon. It's great to be here. I think what a way to start. I do think it's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=13.68s)]
*  important and certainly as House Democrats, we were very clear with the president, thanked [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=22.76s)]
*  him for his continued leadership, his partnership, the bravery of the Ukrainian war effort, the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=28.56s)]
*  necessity of it continuing and America's support continuing. It's my understanding that the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=34.32s)]
*  meeting between President Zelensky and the entirety of the Senate went well. Hopefully [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=40.36s)]
*  that will help the Senate arrive at an agreement sooner rather than later over the next few [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=47.6s)]
*  days because we have no choice, no option, but to continue to fund the Ukrainian war [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=54.36s)]
*  effort both in the interests of America's national security, period, full stop, but [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  also because Ukraine is on the side of a real existential conflict that is going on throughout [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=69.12s)]
*  the world as the previous panel talked about. There's democracy versus autocracy. There's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=75.0s)]
*  freedom versus tyranny. There's truth versus propaganda. And Ukraine is on the side of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=80.4s)]
*  democracy, of freedom and of truth, and we should make sure that we continue to stand [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=86.2s)]
*  with them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=91.2s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, though, the funding is caught up in this political battle and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=92.2s)]
*  the Senate is trying to make a big deal on many issues, including border security. Was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=95.44s)]
*  it smart of the White House to put all those issues together? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=101.0s)]
*  In terms of policy changes related to the border, that was injected by House Republicans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=105.32s)]
*  back in September when you recall that the Senate was moving in a bipartisan way on funding [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  the government and providing about $6 billion in assistance to the Ukrainian war effort. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=123.72s)]
*  It was a test vote in the Senate. I think it got 79 votes, Democrats and Republicans [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=132.24s)]
*  standing together. It was working its way through the Senate when we were up against [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  a possible government shutdown on September 30th. And my House Republican colleagues short-circuited [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=145.72s)]
*  that effort, put a different bill on the floor, and basically created a situation where we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=151.88s)]
*  were either going to shut down the government because of the absence of assistance to Ukraine [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=158.4s)]
*  or we were going to make sure that the government remained open, which is the choice that we [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=165.84s)]
*  ultimately made, but leave the bipartisan effort in the Senate with respect to Ukrainian [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=170.28s)]
*  support behind. And this has been a continuing narrative up until this point injecting border [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=176.96s)]
*  policy changes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, I think the White House has been clear, Senate Democrats have been clear, in the House [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=184.56s)]
*  we've been clear that we recognize there are challenges related to the border that need [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=188.6s)]
*  to be decisively addressed. And it should be done in a comprehensive and in a bipartisan [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  way and in a manner consistent, I think, with two principles, two values important to what [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=199.32s)]
*  America is all about. One, we are a nation of immigrants and that has helped us from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=205.76s)]
*  an economic standpoint, from a competitiveness standpoint, continue to be dynamic and involving [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  in the context of a globalized economy. So that has to continue. For workforce shortage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=218.48s)]
*  reasons, for economic competitiveness reasons, that has to continue. But we also are a nation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=224.0s)]
*  anchored in the rule of law. And so whatever resolution we arrive at, and there should [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  be one, we do have to address the situation at the border, it should be consistent with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=234.14s)]
*  those two principles. And the question is, can you arrive at a sensible, meaningful resolution [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=238.32s)]
*  of a clear challenge with a gun being held to the head of the American people in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=245.4s)]
*  context of our national security interests in Ukraine? That doesn't strike me as the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=251.32s)]
*  appropriate way to do public policy, but that has been put on the table by my colleagues [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=256.44s)]
*  on the other side of the aisle. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=262.44s)]
*  Speaking of House Republicans, they're voting in committee, I believe, as we speak to open [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=264.4s)]
*  an impeachment inquiry and on the floor tomorrow. How do you view that effort? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=269.28s)]
*  It's an illegitimate impeachment inquiry. I guess no surprise there in terms of my answer. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=274.64s)]
*  But the biggest problem, beyond the fact that there's no evidence of wrongdoing connected [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=282.12s)]
*  to the President, no evidence of an impeachable offense being committed, no evidence that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=288.7s)]
*  the President has in any way, shape or form broken the law, notwithstanding the fact that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=294.62s)]
*  over 100,000 pages of documents have been turned over, people have been deposed, and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=300.18s)]
*  yet Republicans are continuing with what we believe is a political hit job. The other [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=307.18s)]
*  problem is that with all of the challenges that we have in America and throughout the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=315.18s)]
*  world, an economy that has made significant progress under the Biden administration, but [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=319.18s)]
*  there's still fragility connected to that. We can work on economic issues. We can work [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=324.18s)]
*  on inflationary pressure. We can work on affordable housing, which is a big challenge for the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=329.18s)]
*  American people, not just on the coasts in New York, LA, San Francisco, or Boston, all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=335.18s)]
*  over the country right now. We can work on issues like lifting up reproductive freedom [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=340.18s)]
*  as opposed to moving in the other direction, which we see in horrific ways happening in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=346.18s)]
*  Texas. We can work on trying to deal with the gun violence epidemic. This shouldn't [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=352.18s)]
*  be a partisan issue, the notion that our children, our students, faculty members, others are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=356.18s)]
*  being slaughtered by weapons of war in grocery stores, on college campuses, in classrooms, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=363.18s)]
*  in movie theaters, in Walmart parking lots. This is an extraordinary thing that we're [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=369.18s)]
*  dealing with in America in terms of the explosion of mass shootings. None of these issues are [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=374.18s)]
*  on the agenda of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Instead, we're going to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=381.18s)]
*  be spending time today and tomorrow on a political hit job against President Joe Biden prior [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=386.18s)]
*  to the election, probably because they were in part directed to do so by the likely opponent [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=392.18s)]
*  to President Biden in the election next year. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=401.18s)]
*  The Israel Hamas conflict has divided your members, and 20 Democrats recently voted to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=404.18s)]
*  censure a fellow Democrat, Rashida Tlaib. What are those conversations like behind the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=410.18s)]
*  scenes? How tense has it been? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=416.18s)]
*  Well, we're going to continue to work through the issue. I think the overwhelming majority [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=419.18s)]
*  of us stand clearly and squarely behind President Biden's leadership, which has been decisive [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=425.18s)]
*  and comprehensive with a level of moral clarity that I think is required because of the horrific [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=433.18s)]
*  events of October 7th, the largest loss of Jewish life on a single day since the Holocaust [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=439.18s)]
*  and the atrocities perpetrated that day. I don't believe I'm fully understood by the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=447.18s)]
*  American people at this point, but will be as we move forward. And so I think there's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=454.18s)]
*  three objectives that need to be simultaneously worked on. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=461.18s)]
*  Clearly, Israel doesn't simply have a right, but it has a responsibility to defend itself [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=468.18s)]
*  and decisively defeat Hamas, a brutal terrorist organization. We also need to make sure we're [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=476.18s)]
*  doing everything possible to secure the witnesses that are still hostages that are still being [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=484.18s)]
*  held by Hamas. Third, I think we have to do everything possible to make sure that we're [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=492.18s)]
*  surging humanitarian assistance to Palestinians who are in harm's way in Gaza through no fault of their own. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=500.18s)]
*  And also make sure that as the war continues and is being prosecuted, that everything is being done [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=508.18s)]
*  to prevent civilian casualties moving forward. I think the administration is doing everything that it can [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  to do that. Now, you may have a handful of members who have a different perspective, but at least on the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=524.18s)]
*  House side, with respect to the Democratic caucus, we have a view that unity is different than unanimity. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=534.18s)]
*  And there's going to be a differing of opinions on a variety of subjects, both domestic and international, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=542.18s)]
*  and that will always be the case on matters of war and peace. But we should maintain a unity of purpose in terms of how we approach [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=550.18s)]
*  solving problems for hardworking American taxpayers, and that is to continue to put people over politics. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=558.18s)]
*  You've now worked with more than one Republican speaker. Speaker Johnson was here last night. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=564.18s)]
*  How do you think he's doing and what do you think are the chances that the House will be able to keep the government open next month? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=570.18s)]
*  Well, we've been able to narrowly avert two government shutdowns up until this point. Once on October 1st, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=578.18s)]
*  immediately before the end of the fiscal year, and then most recently in mid-November. And on each occasion, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=588.18s)]
*  it's been Democrats who have provided the majority of the votes necessary to keep the government open. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=598.18s)]
*  And our approach is that we'll continue to be there to work in a bipartisan way. From the very beginning of the Congress, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=604.18s)]
*  we've said that we are ready, willing, and able to find common ground with our Republican colleagues on any issue, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=613.18s)]
*  bipartisan common ground, whenever and wherever possible, while at the same time making clear that we'll push back against extremism [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=624.18s)]
*  whenever necessary. That's been sort of our guiding principle moving forward. And in that context, as it relates to keeping the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=633.18s)]
*  government open, we're all in, in doing what is necessary to meet the needs of the American people, which is what the government is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=643.18s)]
*  designed to do in terms of health, safety, economic well-being, the security of the American people here, and our national security interests abroad. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=653.18s)]
*  So I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to find the common ground necessary. There's been a lot of talk about a top line spending number, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=665.18s)]
*  which is the challenge right now. We negotiated a top line spending number in May with respect to the Bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act as part of the effort [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=674.18s)]
*  to avoid a catastrophic default on our nation's debt, which would have had immense consequences for the American people, for industry, for business, for the economy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=685.18s)]
*  Now, as part of avoiding that catastrophic default, my Republican colleagues, including the former speaker, who I've got great respect for, insisted, insisted [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=695.18s)]
*  that we negotiate spending numbers as part of raising the debt ceiling. Their insistence, not ours. Now, as a result of that insistence, we arrived at top line [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=705.18s)]
*  spending numbers for this current fiscal year. And less than a week after the Bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act was not just agreed upon, but passed into law, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=720.18s)]
*  about two-thirds of the House Republican Conference supporting it, my House Republican colleagues walked away from the agreement that they themselves negotiated, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=733.18s)]
*  passed into law, and insisted be part of avoiding a catastrophic default. And so we're just going to proceed with what we believe is the reasonable position. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=743.18s)]
*  The spending numbers are the spending numbers that the House Republican colleagues agreed to. Period. Full stop. House Democrats are in agreement with those spending numbers. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=755.18s)]
*  Senate Republicans are in agreement with those spending numbers. Senate Democrats are in agreement with those spending numbers. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=767.18s)]
*  The Biden administration is in agreement with those spending numbers. We've got one group of people on an island by themselves, effectively trying to renegotiate an agreement [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=773.18s)]
*  that by simply trying to do that will take us down the path of a government shutdown. We're not asking for more than the spending numbers that were previously agreed upon, but we just don't think it's viable to do less. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl64TSnjG-M&t=786.18s)]
