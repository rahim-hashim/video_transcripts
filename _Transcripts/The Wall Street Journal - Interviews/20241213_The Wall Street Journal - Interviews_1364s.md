# Former Trump Adviser Kellyanne Conway on the President-Electâ€™s Second Chance  | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI)
*  Let me start with a baseline question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=0.0s)]
*  Why did Donald Trump win? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=2.4s)]
*  First of all, thank you so much, Jerry and Alan [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=4.44s)]
*  and The Wall Street Journal, Catherine Lucey, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=6.92s)]
*  for inviting me to address your CEO counsel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=8.64s)]
*  I'm very happy to be here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=11.32s)]
*  So Donald Trump won for a few reasons. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=13.0s)]
*  First and foremost, if you go back to the primary system, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=14.84s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump won because, for many reasons, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=19.44s)]
*  but for the same bias in hiring that we all have [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=23.96s)]
*  and we may not realize. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=26.72s)]
*  We all share the same bias in hiring, Jerry, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=28.16s)]
*  and it's we prefer to hire someone to do a job [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=30.48s)]
*  who's done the job before. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=33.84s)]
*  So you lateral in someone from the same industry, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=35.68s)]
*  a different, maybe a competitor. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=39.16s)]
*  You put together a resume, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=41.0s)]
*  you ask for someone's references, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=42.8s)]
*  you ask a current employer for a great recommendation [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=44.56s)]
*  for a future employer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=47.72s)]
*  We all have this bias in hiring. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=49.42s)]
*  In America, looked at Donald Trump and said, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=50.92s)]
*  he did this job before, I wanted to do the job again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=53.36s)]
*  And in that way, he does see his mandate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=56.72s)]
*  of getting us back to where he had us in 2019, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=59.92s)]
*  whether it's a deregulatory agenda, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=63.28s)]
*  it's the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  2019, before the year of the global pandemic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  and social unrest after George Floyd's murder, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=70.12s)]
*  2019 is when we had the low unemployment rate, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  low interest rates, certainly, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=75.64s)]
*  highest wage growth per household in decades, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=78.36s)]
*  over 70%, I think I read it in the Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=82.44s)]
*  over 70% of new jobs went to women. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=85.04s)]
*  So it was just the salad days, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=88.0s)]
*  energy independence, no foreign conflicts, obviously, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=90.12s)]
*  border, much more in control. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  So people want him to get back there, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=95.78s)]
*  but what they also want, and this led to his win, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=97.28s)]
*  is for him to fix what they think has been broken [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=100.06s)]
*  in the four years he's been gone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  So 70% of the country had said, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=106.12s)]
*  we're off on the wrong track, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=108.2s)]
*  it's very difficult for the party in power, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=109.26s)]
*  Biden or Harris, after him, to win [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=111.12s)]
*  when seven in 10 people are admitting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=113.58s)]
*  they think we're off in the wrong direction. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=115.66s)]
*  The other ways that President Trump won is, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=117.66s)]
*  I think Kamala Harris's candidacy was a sign of the times, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=120.14s)]
*  but I think that Donald Trump's candidacy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=124.56s)]
*  him as the candidate was almost a metaphor [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=128.78s)]
*  for where many Americans want America [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=130.88s)]
*  to be and to go right now, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=133.3s)]
*  which is when he gets up and he's bleeding [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=134.66s)]
*  and he says, fight, fight, fight, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=137.14s)]
*  when he survives all these indictments [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=139.18s)]
*  and impeachments and investigations and insults [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=142.26s)]
*  and rip his name off the ballot, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=144.54s)]
*  rip his name off of his buildings, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=146.82s)]
*  rip him from his family company, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=148.78s)]
*  and people say, you know what, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=150.22s)]
*  whatever I feel about him personally, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  or even politically, the last four to eight years, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  this is someone who's tough. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  And I will say, for all the folks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=159.78s)]
*  who like to moan and complain, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=161.34s)]
*  and even during the Republican primary, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=164.54s)]
*  the argument was, I want Trump's policies [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=166.54s)]
*  without Trump's personality. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=168.62s)]
*  Many Americans have discovered, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  you don't get Trump's policies without Trump's personality, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=172.54s)]
*  and they want someone who's resolute and tough. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=174.9s)]
*  Last thing I just wanna say about process, this is key. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  I think what helped President Trump win and win big [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=179.5s)]
*  was the Republican Party and his campaign [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=182.5s)]
*  and a lot of these outside groups [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=184.74s)]
*  got super smart and super bold [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=186.74s)]
*  and did what the Democrats had done for years, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  particularly in 2020, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=191.9s)]
*  which is invest in what I call [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  the non-sexy parts of politics, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=194.86s)]
*  the early vote, the chase the low propensity, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  no propensity voters, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=200.38s)]
*  becoming a resource to voters [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  as to where to vote and when to vote. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  They spent millions and millions of dollars doing that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=205.34s)]
*  and him going on TikTok, not banning it, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=208.1s)]
*  but going on it instead, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  and him going on podcasts also obviously made a big difference. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=212.38s)]
*  But in that vein, how important was Elon Musk's contribution? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  Because there was, Republicans are very happy [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=220.22s)]
*  with the way they micro-targeted their message, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=223.62s)]
*  but that's not a cheap proposition. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=226.82s)]
*  How crucial was Elon Musk's money? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=229.1s)]
*  Elon Musk, well, Elon Musk himself, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=231.62s)]
*  I think more than his money, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=233.9s)]
*  and then and now is an incredibly essential player [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=235.18s)]
*  in all of this because Americans, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  particularly young men, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=242.78s)]
*  don't look at Elon Musk as a celebrity. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=243.82s)]
*  So Kamala Harris and other Democrats [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=245.86s)]
*  tend to have celebrities around them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=248.1s)]
*  We saw a lot of that this time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=249.38s)]
*  People really tend to tune that out [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=251.1s)]
*  or it's not breaking news to them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=252.74s)]
*  Oh, Taylor Swift and Eminem, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=254.54s)]
*  two artists who I've happened to enjoy their music [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=257.06s)]
*  and I've been to their concerts, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=259.7s)]
*  but it's not breaking news to anyone [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=261.18s)]
*  that they would be endorsing Kamala Harris. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=262.62s)]
*  People don't look at Elon Musk as a celebrity. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=265.5s)]
*  They look at him as a job creator, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=267.97999999999996s)]
*  as an innovator, as a futurist, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  as someone who launches a space, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=271.46s)]
*  launches a rocket, and if it melts down, just tries again. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=274.9s)]
*  And maybe he's going to take us into space [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=278.38s)]
*  to get some cures or discovery. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=280.14s)]
*  A lot of young people, a lot of conservatives [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  also see Elon Musk as the guy who saved Twitter for them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=284.82s)]
*  They don't feel silenced and shadow banned and censored [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=288.05999999999995s)]
*  anymore. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  A lot of the resistance picked up their toys [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=292.05999999999995s)]
*  and went to a different sandbox. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=294.34s)]
*  I'm leaving Twitter because they had it all to themselves. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=295.58s)]
*  They could just sit there all day [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=297.7s)]
*  and tweet at each other about how terrible Donald Trump is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=299.34s)]
*  So that stopped. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=302.46s)]
*  Elon Musk made his contributions fairly late in the game. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=303.85999999999996s)]
*  And I think most of it, as I understand, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=307.26s)]
*  maybe after President Trump was shot in Butler, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  but it's Elon Musk parking himself in Pennsylvania [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=313.14s)]
*  that also is helpful because he's a one-of-a-kind asset. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=315.62s)]
*  And he and Vivek Ramaswamy now saying, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=318.26s)]
*  we're going to go and lead DOGE as volunteers. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=320.9s)]
*  It is a presidential commission. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  It's executive office of the president project. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=326.7s)]
*  It is not congressionally mandated or legislated [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=329.94s)]
*  or created or funded. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  But I think they're onto something there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  People have a lot of enthusiasm and very high hopes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=336.82s)]
*  for what they can do in terms of government efficiency. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=341.74s)]
*  Well, so let's go there because you said immediately [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  after the election, rarely do you get a second chance [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=347.38s)]
*  as big as this one. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=350.14s)]
*  Second chance to do what? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes. So I was talking about that in this life, thankfully, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=353.98s)]
*  we all get second chances. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=357.7s)]
*  I don't know anybody who gets one as big [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=359.38s)]
*  as the one President Trump has just received [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=361.09999999999997s)]
*  to be president again, especially after he's overcome [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=363.3s)]
*  so much to get there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=367.14s)]
*  The second chance I believe is for him to, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  as I said earlier, get us back, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=371.62s)]
*  do the things he did the first time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  I'd say beginning with DREG and everyday affordability, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=375.3s)]
*  but also to undo many of the things he sees [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=378.94s)]
*  have caused great, he thinks have caused great harm. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=381.66s)]
*  He's learning all these, about all these crazy programs [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  in the departments and agencies that have nothing to do [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=388.1s)]
*  with that department and agency. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=390.26s)]
*  I think this election was also about, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  it was fairness over wokeness. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=395.58000000000004s)]
*  We all know it was about inflation and migration [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=397.06s)]
*  and those things. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=399.06s)]
*  It was about security and everyday affordability. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=400.3s)]
*  But it was also a fairness election. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=402.9s)]
*  Jerry, a lot of Americans, if you listen to them [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=405.62s)]
*  in focus groups, if you read the polls as I do and I do, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=407.74s)]
*  a lot of Americans are saying, well, wait a second, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=410.9s)]
*  this is just not fair. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  What's not fair? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=414.42s)]
*  It's not fair to have plumbers and pipe fitters pay [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=415.5s)]
*  for student loans of doctors and lawyers. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=418.5s)]
*  They'll say it's not fair that 10 million people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=420.78s)]
*  came here illegally and here's what's different [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=422.74s)]
*  from 10 years ago when Donald Trump elevated that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=425.62s)]
*  into the national consciousness. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=427.78s)]
*  And it was mired at three or four percent [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=429.34s)]
*  in my polling or the Wall Street Journal polling. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=431.38s)]
*  It really wasn't up there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=433.06s)]
*  Now it's the, now migration and border security, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=435.14s)]
*  which is more inclusive, that more expansive, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=438.38s)]
*  that was the number two issue in the seven swing states. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=442.29999999999995s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=444.53999999999996s)]
*  In the seven swing states and in national polls, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=445.38s)]
*  I mentioned God. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=447.9s)]
*  It's a safe space, don't we? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=451.09999999999997s)]
*  There you go, I'm glad, yes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=452.09999999999997s)]
*  The new safe space, God, wonderful. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=454.22s)]
*  This is an improvement. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=456.5s)]
*  So in any event, people will say, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  what's different this time is they'll say, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=461.62s)]
*  well, wait a second, so 10 million, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  that's a number larger than, that's a number higher [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  than the population of 39 states. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=468.1s)]
*  People know it's a big number, but here's what's different. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=469.94000000000005s)]
*  They open up their phone, they turn on the TV, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=472.54s)]
*  and they see people who just got here [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=474.62s)]
*  getting cell phones and debit cards and clothing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=477.62s)]
*  and hotel rooms in New York City [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  and the greatest affront, your kid's desk [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=483.34s)]
*  in a New York City classroom and they're saying, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=486.78s)]
*  hold on, that's not fair. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  They don't think of themselves as racist. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  In fact, many of them were African American [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=491.82s)]
*  and Hispanic parents and grandparents. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=493.61999999999995s)]
*  And then the other part of the unfairness people saw, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=495.7s)]
*  I think that last ad showing Kamala Harris saying, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=498.73999999999995s)]
*  promising to give surgeries [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=502.7s)]
*  for all transgender prisoners was really, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=504.78s)]
*  that two people say, you know what, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't think of myself as a transphobe. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=510.46s)]
*  I think of myself as what are we doing? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=513.5s)]
*  Why is she promising to spend our money doing that? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=515.86s)]
*  And the last part of that is education. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=517.9s)]
*  I think the untold story of this election [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=520.46s)]
*  were how many people were part [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=522.78s)]
*  of the parents' rights renaissance [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=524.38s)]
*  that started during COVID but accelerated [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=526.26s)]
*  in Glenn Youngkin's victory in Virginia in 2021. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=528.46s)]
*  So three years later, parents are still saying, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=531.66s)]
*  my kids in her fourth year have lost learning. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=534.06s)]
*  I want more of a say where my kids go to school [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=537.1s)]
*  and I want to understand what is taught there [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=539.42s)]
*  and who's teaching them. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=540.5s)]
*  And so I think that was easy to miss [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=541.66s)]
*  because we're talking about inflation, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=543.74s)]
*  we're talking about the border, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=545.18s)]
*  we're talking about Ukraine and Middle East, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=546.14s)]
*  all of which were important to people. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=547.66s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump has benefited two times now [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=549.62s)]
*  by running against women that I think [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=553.34s)]
*  did not perform the way that they needed to win. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=558.42s)]
*  It's as politely as I'm, yes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=561.42s)]
*  Park that thought for a second [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=563.18s)]
*  because I want to talk about the women's vote. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=564.26s)]
*  But before, let me pick up on the agenda [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=567.1s)]
*  that you just described. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=570.34s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=571.38s)]
*  in fact, this was articulated earlier today in this room, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=572.5400000000001s)]
*  there are a lot of people who say, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=574.98s)]
*  love to hear the deregulatory message, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=575.98s)]
*  that's where we're at. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=577.82s)]
*  But you give me a combination of high tariffs [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=580.26s)]
*  and reductions in the workforce [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=584.82s)]
*  by big push against immigrants. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=586.94s)]
*  That's a double whammy to the economy [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=591.58s)]
*  and potentially to my company, that's gonna hurt. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=593.38s)]
*  What's your response to them? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=596.66s)]
*  Well, first of all, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=598.54s)]
*  Donald Trump has heard all that before. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=599.38s)]
*  These predictions of World War III, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=601.3399999999999s)]
*  he's the first one to preside over no new wars, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=603.4599999999999s)]
*  that the economies, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=606.8199999999999s)]
*  and these Nobel laureates telling us all [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  that the economy is going to tank [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=609.62s)]
*  if Donald Trump's in charge of it, oh my goodness. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=611.2199999999999s)]
*  And of course, we had growth and we had no inflation [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=613.66s)]
*  and we had energy independence. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=617.02s)]
*  I mean, everybody knows what we had. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=618.9s)]
*  So in some ways, this is the sequel to the original, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=620.54s)]
*  we've heard that before. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=624.02s)]
*  I think there's a lot more optimism and curiosity [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=624.86s)]
*  and maybe a little bit more grace this time [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=628.38s)]
*  for President Trump in terms of, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=630.9s)]
*  let's just see what he and his team can do. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=632.9s)]
*  Jerry, I would say this, I'm gonna quote Donald Trump, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=636.42s)]
*  I'm gonna quote Scott Besson as incoming Treasury Secretary, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=638.58s)]
*  quote Howard Lutnick as incoming Commerce Secretary. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=641.1s)]
*  They've all weighed in on tariffs very recently [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=643.38s)]
*  and it's a combination of the following. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=645.94s)]
*  Tariffs traditionally have been used [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=649.34s)]
*  for two major purposes, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=652.66s)]
*  to raise revenue or to protect important industries [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=653.82s)]
*  in our country. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=657.0200000000001s)]
*  I think President Trump is out of the third [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=658.0600000000001s)]
*  and that's as a negotiating tool, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=659.74s)]
*  a tool in and of itself, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=661.9000000000001s)]
*  but also a negotiating tool to compel [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=662.9000000000001s)]
*  or incentivize behavior in other areas. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=665.22s)]
*  So when he sends out his social media missive [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=668.3000000000001s)]
*  to Mexico and Canada, and he threatens 25% tariffs, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=673.82s)]
*  what was the message? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=678.58s)]
*  It wasn't about goods and services, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=679.7s)]
*  it was about crime and drugs. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=681.34s)]
*  And he's saying to these two leaders [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=683.58s)]
*  of Mexico and Canada respectively, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=685.46s)]
*  get your crime and your drugs, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=687.9s)]
*  get your criminals and your drugs out of our country [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=689.98s)]
*  and then you won't have tariffs. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=692.5s)]
*  So Donald Trump, I think, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=693.74s)]
*  President Trump would probably look at tariffs [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=694.94s)]
*  as your choice, not his. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=696.62s)]
*  Are you going to be a net exporter? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=699.02s)]
*  Are you gonna do more Made in the USA? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=701.3000000000001s)]
*  He's promising a 15% corporate tax rate if you are. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=702.78s)]
*  And so I also think, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  let Nick and Besson make good points about tariffs too, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  so let me put a plug in for each of them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=710.62s)]
*  They also make the point that, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=712.62s)]
*  look, the tariffs that existed or that we held off on [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=714.5s)]
*  and trying to help Germany and Japan rebuild their economies, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=719.62s)]
*  for example, after World War II, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=723.3s)]
*  why are those still around? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=727.0600000000001s)]
*  I think they rebuilt their economies. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=727.9s)]
*  We can argue about their economies now, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  but that's got nothing to do with World War II or tariffs. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=730.42s)]
*  And also, I feel that President Trump, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=733.94s)]
*  he's consistent and transparent [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=737.78s)]
*  in that he's been the guy from the beginning [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=739.66s)]
*  who has said, I want reciprocal, fair trade deals [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=741.86s)]
*  that protect and benefit America, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=746.34s)]
*  American workers, and American industries. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=749.42s)]
*  So when he says, as he did over the weekend, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=752.9s)]
*  that he's prepared to deport the Dreamers, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=756.02s)]
*  does he mean that, or is that a way [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=758.9s)]
*  to occupy a negotiating position [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  for the coming conversation with Democrats in Congress [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=764.42s)]
*  about an immigration deal? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=766.94s)]
*  No, I think he said he wasn't going to deport the Dreamers. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=767.78s)]
*  You mean make a deal. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=769.98s)]
*  He said he was going to deport, I believe, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=771.22s)]
*  that, and I'm sorry, am I mistaken? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=774.86s)]
*  I think he said he would make a deal with the Dreamers [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=777.58s)]
*  or think about it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=780.74s)]
*  But the first and foremost, he and Stephen Miller, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=781.82s)]
*  who was on a Maria Bartiroma show this past weekend, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=784.5s)]
*  was very specific and granular about the deportation plan. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=787.3000000000001s)]
*  It starts with criminals. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=791.1800000000001s)]
*  It starts with folks on the watch list [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=792.94s)]
*  who, for very bad and sad reasons, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=794.7s)]
*  somehow are here and shouldn't be here. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=797.46s)]
*  And then it starts with folks who should not be here, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=800.9000000000001s)]
*  and people trying to scare folks [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=806.58s)]
*  that it's going to be their grandmother [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=808.94s)]
*  or your landscaper of 30 years or your, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=811.38s)]
*  that, again, is a lot of what they do to scare people. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=813.86s)]
*  I will just say for the record that President Obama [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=817.9000000000001s)]
*  and I believe President Biden both had more deportations [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=820.62s)]
*  than President Trump, so people should not think [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=823.62s)]
*  that this is specific to President Trump [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=825.9000000000001s)]
*  or the Republican Party. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=828.3000000000001s)]
*  And in terms of the workforce, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=830.62s)]
*  this is a president who has reconstructed, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=834.38s)]
*  recast the Republican Party as the party of the worker. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=837.74s)]
*  He did that in his first term. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=840.94s)]
*  He did that all through this campaign, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=842.94s)]
*  and he will continue to do that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=844.7s)]
*  Jerry, when I look at the election results, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=846.46s)]
*  if you just look at what President Obama received [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=849.14s)]
*  among which core Democratic constituencies in 2012, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=851.82s)]
*  and you look at what President Trump received in 2024, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=855.38s)]
*  there's no mistaking that the Trump, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=859.8199999999999s)]
*  the Obama coalition is now Trump country. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=862.3s)]
*  The migration of voters, African-American, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=864.86s)]
*  union households, Hispanic, somewhat Jewish Americans, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=867.9399999999999s)]
*  but non-college-educated households, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=871.54s)]
*  which I think some people have derided as low information. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=874.5s)]
*  They're low propensity, they're not low information, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=879.14s)]
*  and they were high turnout. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=882.18s)]
*  And they, this is the party of the worker. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=883.54s)]
*  We did an awful lot for workforce development, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=886.54s)]
*  for vocational, technical, educational opportunities [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=890.14s)]
*  in the first term. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=893.0999999999999s)]
*  I would tell everyone here, get on that bandwagon [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=893.9399999999999s)]
*  because you're going to see that again from President Trump. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=896.78s)]
*  He believes the workforce can be anyone, anywhere. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=898.9799999999999s)]
*  We're pushing all these people into colleges, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=901.9799999999999s)]
*  four-year colleges, and we need a lot of skilled labor as well. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=904.42s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion about the bro vote, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=910.5799999999999s)]
*  a lot of discussion about young voters. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=912.3s)]
*  I'm curious why, as somebody who studied this question [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=914.26s)]
*  for a long time, why wasn't there this wave of women voters [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=917.5s)]
*  for Kamala Harris that a lot [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=921.86s)]
*  of people thought would emerge and basically save the day for her? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=923.1800000000001s)]
*  Why didn't that wave not materialize? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=927.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, in some ways, the answer is two words, Kamala Harris. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=929.7s)]
*  She did not run a good campaign. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=933.9000000000001s)]
*  She's not an informative, a particularly informative [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=935.34s)]
*  or inspirational candidate. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=940.0600000000001s)]
*  That is not an insult. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=942.34s)]
*  I'm telling you the way the public received it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=943.6600000000001s)]
*  And if you don't believe me, go back [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=945.22s)]
*  and look at all the election results there. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=946.58s)]
*  I think tough to digest and not see [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=948.58s)]
*  that this was a sweeping rebuke of, I think, her as a candidate, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=951.98s)]
*  but also the campaign she ran, which was this seemed to be [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=957.0600000000001s)]
*  like a little bit of a mishmash of identity politics. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=959.58s)]
*  Some of the Obama people there sprinkled in with all [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=962.82s)]
*  of the Biden folks, the 500 people who were already there [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=965.1s)]
*  when he was at the top of the ticket, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=968.26s)]
*  maybe a couple of her folks. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=970.0600000000001s)]
*  Why do I say this? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=971.34s)]
*  I say this because I think that her campaign proved. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=972.62s)]
*  Hillary Clinton's campaign sort of suggested it, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=975.8199999999999s)]
*  but Kamala Harris's campaign proved to me [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=979.62s)]
*  that money is not all it's cracked up to be in politics. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=982.06s)]
*  They spent $2 billion. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=984.66s)]
*  They spent so much money on paid political advertising, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  on some things that just don't make any sense in terms [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=989.26s)]
*  of getting voters to come out and turn out for you. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=992.62s)]
*  As goes women. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=995.3399999999999s)]
*  I am so proud of women, not just because Donald Trump won, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=997.22s)]
*  but because I think this is the election, Jerry, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1000.26s)]
*  where people said that's it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1003.38s)]
*  No more are you going to tell me whoever the you is. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1006.46s)]
*  Is it the media? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1008.82s)]
*  Is it Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1009.66s)]
*  Is it the establishment? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1011.42s)]
*  Whoever the you is, you are not going to tell me anymore [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1013.38s)]
*  who I am, what I believe, and for whom I should vote [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1017.14s)]
*  based on my gender, my age, my religion, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1020.98s)]
*  my sexual orientation, my socioeconomic status, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1023.94s)]
*  my zip code, whether I'm married, whether I have children, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1027.1s)]
*  whether I own a dog or a cat. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1031.18s)]
*  I'm gonna make my own decisions. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1032.46s)]
*  And when you look at this, what President Trump [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1034.3s)]
*  in his campaign did so brilliantly is yes, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1037.6200000000001s)]
*  they turned out and turned up the vote among people, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1040.66s)]
*  some of his core supporters. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1044.94s)]
*  I think when people said base, they're trying to insult him. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1046.3s)]
*  He had a base plus from the beginning [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1049.22s)]
*  or he wouldn't have been the nominee, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1050.5s)]
*  let alone the president. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1051.46s)]
*  They're turning up the voters among low [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1053.04s)]
*  and no propensity voters who otherwise would support him [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1054.58s)]
*  and came out for him. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1057.52s)]
*  But then they're mitigating the natural deficits [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1058.42s)]
*  that any Republican presidential nominee would have. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1060.78s)]
*  A generic, a generic Democratic presidential nominee [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  winning as Kamala Harris did women by eight points [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1070.54s)]
*  is a shock. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1073.74s)]
*  It is absolutely stunning. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1074.6599999999999s)]
*  Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump among women by 13 points [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1076.86s)]
*  and we beat her for the presidency. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1080.62s)]
*  Joe Biden won by 13 points. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1082.34s)]
*  President Obama beat Mitt Romney by 11 points among women, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1084.22s)]
*  did even better in 08 against McCain. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1086.98s)]
*  So for the female candidate of color [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1089.3799999999999s)]
*  who's going to make history, come make history with me [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1093.86s)]
*  while they're peddling abortion as the top issue [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1096.3s)]
*  to come to only win by eight points [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1099.02s)]
*  is that is a true devastation to a party. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1101.4599999999998s)]
*  And why did women not come out? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1104.9399999999998s)]
*  They did come out. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1106.06s)]
*  We have been the majority of voters [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1106.8999999999999s)]
*  in presidential elections since 1964. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1108.3799999999999s)]
*  We just had the 16th consecutive election [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1110.3799999999999s)]
*  where we decide who the president is, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1112.4599999999998s)]
*  but we're not gonna be narrow casted. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1114.26s)]
*  You're not gonna talk to us from the waist down only [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1116.6599999999999s)]
*  and expect us to vote for you. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1118.62s)]
*  We wanna be talked to from the waist up also [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1120.1s)]
*  where our brains, our eyes, our ears, our hearts, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1122.02s)]
*  and my big mouth is. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1124.78s)]
*  And this is important because we are not [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1126.86s)]
*  single issue thinkers, we are not single issue voters, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1129.54s)]
*  we're not single task doers by day. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1131.58s)]
*  And so abortion was important, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1133.86s)]
*  but I think it was actually a bigger issue [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1135.9799999999998s)]
*  in the 2022 midterms than it ended up being [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1137.82s)]
*  in the 2024 presidential. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1140.82s)]
*  And a lot of that was because people see everyday [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1142.6599999999999s)]
*  affordability as crushing them. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1145.58s)]
*  They're upset about the border, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1147.42s)]
*  they're upset about our money going to XYZ, ABC, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1149.02s)]
*  and that I think was more important to them. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1153.38s)]
*  So I wanna see if there's a quick question [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1156.54s)]
*  from the audience, but before I do, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1158.0600000000002s)]
*  very quickly, you've worked for TikTok. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1159.0600000000002s)]
*  Will Donald Trump end the attempt to ban TikTok? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1161.0600000000002s)]
*  So I work for a third party that supports TikTok, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1165.02s)]
*  and I will say this. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1169.6200000000001s)]
*  Last February and March, I was one of a handful, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1171.78s)]
*  I don't even know how many others, telling President Trump [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1174.3400000000001s)]
*  that I thought that he should not ban TikTok, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1177.54s)]
*  that he should get on TikTok. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1179.1s)]
*  Because I noticed, I don't have TikTok on my phone, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1180.6200000000001s)]
*  if somebody sends one to me, I have to ask a teenager [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1182.7s)]
*  to open it for me, so I don't have it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1184.58s)]
*  But I felt that a lot of the saber rattling [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1186.7s)]
*  and a lot of the chest thumping by both parties [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1189.46s)]
*  in this town, we're gonna hold China to account, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1191.46s)]
*  ban TikTok. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1194.54s)]
*  I would love to hold China to account, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1195.38s)]
*  but we're starting with TikTok? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1196.94s)]
*  Did we get, do we have restarting a TikTok [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1198.8600000000001s)]
*  and ending a TikTok? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1201.18s)]
*  That seems to me to be the cheap, easy Washington way [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1202.26s)]
*  of making yourself feel better and check a box. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1204.7s)]
*  The box of China is too important to me, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1207.1000000000001s)]
*  and I think this country and President Trump certainly, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1209.98s)]
*  to check it by alienating 170 million US users monthly. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1212.5s)]
*  So let's get fentanyl the heck out of our country, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1217.02s)]
*  it's the number one killer for 18 to 45 year olds. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1219.9s)]
*  Let's stop these forced technology transfers. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1222.18s)]
*  Let's get in writing the origins of the coronavirus. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1224.54s)]
*  And China's hand in that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1227.94s)]
*  Let's make sure Taiwan is not militarily vulnerable, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1230.3799999999999s)]
*  let alone in the beta. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1234.86s)]
*  Let's make sure that religious minority, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1235.7s)]
*  that Uyghurs aren't persecuted. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1238.26s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1239.46s)]
*  So I said to President Trump, look at this. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1240.62s)]
*  You are 12, 13x over Biden organically on TikTok. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1243.58s)]
*  He wasn't even on TikTok, his people weren't on TikTok. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1247.3799999999999s)]
*  Meaning his people were on TikTok, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1249.6599999999999s)]
*  his team wasn't on TikTok. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1251.4199999999998s)]
*  And so he saw that, and even when Vice President Harris [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1252.86s)]
*  became the nominee, Jerry, all the analytics say [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1257.66s)]
*  that his views on TikTok were 42% higher than hers. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1261.14s)]
*  Forbes Magazine came out with, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1264.26s)]
*  Forbes came out with a study two weeks ago, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1265.66s)]
*  and it said of the 10 highest performing TikToks of 2024, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1268.0600000000002s)]
*  eight were from President Trump, and five in the last week. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1272.3000000000002s)]
*  So a majority of the voters in 2024 voted early, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1275.7s)]
*  but that last week was so critical for so many things, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1278.5800000000002s)]
*  including him in the garbage truck, him at McDonald's, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1281.3400000000001s)]
*  and then the Joe Rogan experience was seen by millions [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1286.42s)]
*  of people as it was happening, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1289.02s)]
*  but it was seen by even more people on TikTok [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1290.74s)]
*  after the fact. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1292.8600000000001s)]
*  So I think, look, this court case is, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1294.06s)]
*  you can't spin it as anyway, other than a loss for TikTok. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1297.38s)]
*  They've gotten till January 19th. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1301.26s)]
*  I think that President Trump says he saved TikTok before. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1302.82s)]
*  He could do it again, that's up to him. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1305.7s)]
*  But remember how he did that the first time. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1308.06s)]
*  In 2019, pre-COVID, there was this threat [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1309.82s)]
*  to strip them from US app stores [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1313.26s)]
*  and strip their app from US stores. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1316.74s)]
*  And instead he had lots of American companies [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1319.38s)]
*  and American individuals saying, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1322.18s)]
*  I would like to put in a bid and buy TikTok. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1324.06s)]
*  So what he did was he said, I want American data [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1326.3s)]
*  and American hands on American soil. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1328.58s)]
*  And he had Oracle, Larry Ellison's, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1331.14s)]
*  AfroCats developed this program that still exists, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1334.18s)]
*  this infrastructure still exists. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1337.82s)]
*  So that's possible. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1338.9s)]
*  It's really difficult when you say to America, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1341.94s)]
*  I'm going to take something away from you [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1344.78s)]
*  that you already have. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1346.3s)]
*  We all know that. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1347.26s)]
*  And that is, you know, it's more than half the country [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1348.26s)]
*  on TikTok. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1350.78s)]
*  That's the reason to overlook this or underlook that. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1351.6200000000001s)]
*  But I have a feeling that there, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1354.26s)]
*  we'll see a flurry of activity before January 19th. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37yxOkWTKiI&t=1357.54s)]
