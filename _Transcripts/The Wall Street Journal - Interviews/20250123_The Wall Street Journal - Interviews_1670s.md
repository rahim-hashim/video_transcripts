**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA)
*  But I want to start with where you came from. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=0.0s)]
*  You came, not in your life, but where you came from before you came here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=3.52s)]
*  Which was DC. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=7.24s)]
*  You were at the inauguration or at some [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  of the parties before the inauguration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=11.58s)]
*  Yes, I was there on the weekend. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=12.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=14.18s)]
*  Uber and you both donated a million dollars to the inaugural fund. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=15.48s)]
*  What are you hoping this is going to buy you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=20.0s)]
*  I think, you know, I don't think these things are available for purchase, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=23.32s)]
*  but I do think that what we want to do is engage with every government [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=27.96s)]
*  that we're a part of and we want to have a voice in terms [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=34.72s)]
*  of how we take things forward. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=37.84s)]
*  And, you know, we're quite optimistic about the overall environment, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=41.08s)]
*  but certainly the environment in the U.S., which looks like it's tipping [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  towards being more pro-business with some pullback on regulations. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=50.84s)]
*  Some folks have felt that have held people back. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=56.4s)]
*  So it's important for us to have a voice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=59.12s)]
*  We certainly have a significant impact on the cities in which we operate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=62.76s)]
*  We've got eight million people who are driving or delivering for us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=68.16s)]
*  So the impact we have on society is significant and we hope to keep building [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=73.48s)]
*  on that impact going forward. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=78.68s)]
*  And again, I'm quite optimistic about what the future is going to bring. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to talk a little bit about where that intersects with EVs [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  in a second, but just like how many people saw the picture of the inauguration [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=86.92s)]
*  with all the tech CEOs and the everyone saw it, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=91.68s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=95.4s)]
*  It's very clear that tech CEOs in general are going to seem to have some really [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  unprecedented access or communication with this administration, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  which I think can be worrisome to some. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=108.04s)]
*  Why is this a good thing in your point of view? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=111.4s)]
*  Well, I think it's a good thing because technology, you know, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=113.8s)]
*  the US technology sector, I believe, is an absolute treasure. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=117.96s)]
*  We have built companies with incredible capabilities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=123.6s)]
*  I think that they are benefiting society generally. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=127.84s)]
*  And we think that, you know, generally, I think technology has had a self view of, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=133.4s)]
*  oh, we shouldn't have a voice in terms of government, in terms of public policy, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=140.28s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=144.8s)]
*  And if you think about the impact that technology has on everyday lives, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=146.44s)]
*  you know, I think it's appropriate to have a voice now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=151.24s)]
*  That voice should be balanced. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  It should be out in the open. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=156.24s)]
*  There should be a diversity of voices that governments engage with. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  But I think that engagement is healthy and ultimately, it's going to be up to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=163.4s)]
*  governments to decide where they go. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=167.2s)]
*  But I think having the voice of technology heard and then governments, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=169.72s)]
*  obviously making whatever decisions they think is the best decision going forward, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=174.68s)]
*  I think that's very healthy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=178.48s)]
*  And I don't think technology should be apologetic for that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=179.64s)]
*  And we're going to get into making sure your voice is heard, because we're going to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=183.16s)]
*  talk about it now. And you've set a pretty ambitious goal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=185.8s)]
*  Yes. By 2023, 2020, 2030, we're already in 2023. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=189.96s)]
*  2023. Did you get all the everyone has the EVs? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=195.4s)]
*  Not yet. I'm going to start this again. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  By 2030, you've said all Uber drivers, you're aiming to have all Uber drivers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=200.52s)]
*  driving EVs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  All Uber drivers in the US, Canada and Europe and 2040 globally. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, frankly, based on how things are going, it's going to be very, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=211.0s)]
*  very difficult for us to hit those targets, as you know, especially in the US. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  And when we look at the OEM industry, there was a huge, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  huge amount of excitement about EVs and the possibilities and investment going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=224.6s)]
*  into battery technology, manufacturing, etc. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=230.6s)]
*  And in the West, and especially in the US, we've seen a significant pullback. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=235.24s)]
*  We are continuing to lean forward. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=240.92s)]
*  If you look at the Uber driver, the average Uber driver is moving to EVs five [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=243.12s)]
*  times faster than the average driver. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=248.84s)]
*  And I think a lot of people count in terms of the number of vehicles sold. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=251.56s)]
*  But actually, if you think about emissions, what counts is the number of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=257.76s)]
*  kilometers driven. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  And the average Uber driver is driving five times the miles and kilometers than [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=264.2s)]
*  the average driver. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=269.64s)]
*  So for us, you know, we absolutely believe that we should continue to lean in. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, with the penetration of EVs and the number of miles that our [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=276.16s)]
*  drivers drive, it is a very, very important initiative for us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=280.92s)]
*  And I think what encourages me, even though the environment is one where OEMs, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  etc., are pulling back, is that our customers and drivers love the product. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=291.6s)]
*  Usually, our drivers will try out an EV through a rental program. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=298.64s)]
*  You talked about leasing an EV as a way to go. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=303.04s)]
*  We offer rental programs or we have fleets that buy these EVs and drivers can [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  try them out, try before you buy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=309.92s)]
*  And then many of them turn into ownership. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  They love the EVs. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=315.12s)]
*  They earn more. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=316.12s)]
*  We've committed to invest about $800 billion in electrifying our fleet. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=316.88s)]
*  And the number one investment goes to lowering our take rate for drivers who [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=323.12s)]
*  drive EVs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=327.8s)]
*  So there's an economic flywheel, an incentive to do so, because the cost of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=328.56s)]
*  EVs still is too high and the residual values still are, to some extent, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=332.44s)]
*  unknown and quite volatile. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  And then when you look at a rider's, the riders love the products as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=339.8s)]
*  So from our standpoint, is it the right thing to do? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=347.44s)]
*  And as a business, we want to be a positive factor in the environment and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=348.08s)]
*  society, etc. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=352.56s)]
*  But what encourages me to keep leaning in is that the product is actually a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=354.64s)]
*  product that our drivers and our riders love. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=360.76s)]
*  That said, there are problems. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  One, the cars are too expensive. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=366.36s)]
*  And we need cheaper EVs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=369.2s)]
*  And many of the OEMs, especially in the US and Europe, are targeting the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=372.88s)]
*  luxury customer. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=378.88s)]
*  So it has been early adopters have been wealthy people who can afford to buy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=381.0s)]
*  more expensive car to support climate. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=385.44s)]
*  And that's great. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=389.4s)]
*  But in order for EVs to go mass market, we need to bring prices down. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=390.44s)]
*  The manufacturers who have brought prices down are Chinese manufacturers. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=396.96s)]
*  And the quality of their cars is excellent. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=402.12s)]
*  Obviously, there's real uncertainty about tariffs, trade barriers, etc. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=405.88s)]
*  So we'll see how that goes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=409.76s)]
*  And then the second factor is range anxiety and charging. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=414.88s)]
*  Like you and I may have that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  We both own EVs. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=416.52s)]
*  But for drivers, time is money. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=418.44s)]
*  And they often the charging infrastructure that goes in for EVs and is in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=422.56s)]
*  center of cities, which isn't necessarily where drivers live. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=429.56s)]
*  They don't have garages where they can charge overnight. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=432.56s)]
*  So we still need help as it relates to manufacturers. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  And we're building a bunch of relationships, but especially from [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  governments and cities to continue the investment in charging infrastructure to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  keep the momentum going forward. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=450.72s)]
*  But I will say the environment right now, if your only goal in life is to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=452.76s)]
*  increase EVs in our fleet and we have other goals, it's a tough environment [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=457.64s)]
*  right now, but it is good business and it's a really good product. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=461.72s)]
*  So we're still committed. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=464.0s)]
*  But the two problems you just discussed, the price of the vehicle and the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=465.2s)]
*  charging were two places that the government was starting to really help. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=469.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=472.52s)]
*  And this week, Trump has said in his executive order, they're going to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=473.24s)]
*  start to pull back on that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=476.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=477.72s)]
*  That can't be good. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=478.8s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=480.28s)]
*  It's not good in the US, but this is where global company and Europe continues. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, one of the reasons why we came here to Davos is, you know, Europe is [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  still committed to the climate. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  And I do think that the good news in the US is that the economic flywheel is [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  starting to work. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=501.52s)]
*  You know, Teslas, of course, they're great vehicles. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=502.2s)]
*  Our drivers love them. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=505.28s)]
*  Our riders love them, et cetera. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=506.76s)]
*  So while government subsidies are incredibly helpful, we also, as a company, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=508.16s)]
*  we don't want to build a business plan that's dependent on government [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=515.28s)]
*  subsidies. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  So I do think we are going to make progress in the US, but we will make more [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  progress outside the US, especially in Europe. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=523.8s)]
*  And that's fine from our perspective. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=528.2s)]
*  And when you look at the penetration in terms of miles driven on our fleet, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=530.36s)]
*  you know, Europe is much higher than the US. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  London is, for example, higher than 30 percent. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=538.4s)]
*  So it's absolutely happening. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=542.36s)]
*  You know, big things can be difficult. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=544.8399999999999s)]
*  And and but we're still committed. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=546.72s)]
*  Have you spoken to President Trump about this? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=549.72s)]
*  I have not spoken to President Trump about this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  Have you spoken to Elon Musk about this? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=555.36s)]
*  You know, I've talked to him about Teslas and how our drivers love Teslas, but I [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=558.16s)]
*  haven't talked to him about, you know, the latest regulation, et cetera. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=561.8s)]
*  The investment. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=564.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's a little busy right now. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=565.76s)]
*  But he kind of might be a good person to talk to. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=567.76s)]
*  His product is absolutely excellent. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  A Tesla product is excellent. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=574.6s)]
*  And it's, you know, a leading model in the US. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=576.32s)]
*  Definitely is one of the bigger problems here, though, convincing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=579.32s)]
*  If you convince the drivers to pay the money and let's say they we have the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  charging thing all sorted out in some perfect world in the US. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=589.32s)]
*  What is what is to them the biggest incentive other than the fact that EVs are great? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=594.0s)]
*  And I have an EV. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=598.96s)]
*  And if you read the column, you know, I love an EV. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=600.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think the biggest incentive is never having to pay for gas again. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=602.24s)]
*  Like it is drivers who make the switch and usually, you know, they they have the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=605.6s)]
*  charging figured out. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=611.88s)]
*  We've also built through our product, for example, kind of smart matching and routing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  so that if you're, let's say, a 20 percent charge, we're not going to send you to the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=621.6s)]
*  trip to the airport where you're going to run out of charge, etc. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=627.76s)]
*  So we're integrating our dispatch algorithms to essentially let our drivers know [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=630.8s)]
*  what is the best kind of charging location, when they should recharge, when prices are [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=638.8399999999999s)]
*  reasonable, etc. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=643.92s)]
*  So that the kind of network is working for them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=645.16s)]
*  And again, the drivers who make the switch love it, but it takes some doing to get them there. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=648.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I every time I'm in an Uber, that's an EV. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=655.52s)]
*  I always I'm happier and we have a good, great. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=659.36s)]
*  Do you talk to the driver? What do they say? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  I always do. And we always have a nice discussion about charging. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=663.6s)]
*  And some of them have home charging, which makes obviously a big. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=666.16s)]
*  That's the best. Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=668.8s)]
*  But then when I'm in a EV, when I'm in a non EV, I usually also ask, right. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=670.28s)]
*  I would be like, what they say. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=674.56s)]
*  Price. Number one thing is price. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=676.6s)]
*  And they don't bring out charging as a concern. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=678.64s)]
*  That's interesting. I mean, for many of these drivers, they've just gotten new cars [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=681.76s)]
*  and they're going to get new cars just because they have a battery. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=684.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you have a Mustang. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=688.28s)]
*  Do you want to drive for Uber? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=689.8s)]
*  You know, try it out. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=691.08s)]
*  We're going to get to the other issues on the drive. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=692.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we're going to get to some of the other issues that some of the drivers have. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=695.0s)]
*  But what I want to also move on to is AVs. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=698.4s)]
*  Yes. You years ago had decided we were going to do your own. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=702.68s)]
*  You were going to do your own eight autonomous vehicles. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=707.44s)]
*  Now you're partnering, you're partnering with Waymo. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=711.12s)]
*  You're partnering with a number of different companies. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=713.6s)]
*  Yes. Why this strategy now? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=715.44s)]
*  Well, I think, first of all, companies have to stick to what they're really great at. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=718.36s)]
*  At Uber, you know, we build software, we build networks that, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=724.08s)]
*  you know, on a concurrent basis, we just hit a million concurrent trips, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=729.12s)]
*  a million people taking Ubers at the same time, which, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=733.48s)]
*  you know, for us was a big deal. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=737.4s)]
*  As I looked at the capabilities of the company, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  it's we just weren't a hardware shop. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=743.4s)]
*  Right. So building out self-driving, it takes deep research [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=746.8s)]
*  and it takes a huge amount of hardware talent. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=750.92s)]
*  And for us, you know, we build AI algorithms, matching pricing, dispatch, etc. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=753.12s)]
*  And it's very difficult. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=759.28s)]
*  There are very few companies that are great at hardware and software at the same time. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  And for me coming in, I wanted to really, really focus on what we're great at. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=764.76s)]
*  And at the same time, when we looked at the environment, at the autonomous environment, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=769.6s)]
*  we saw many, many players who were developing the technology [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=775.72s)]
*  in our having the technology in-house, essentially made the rest of the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=779.6s)]
*  the rest of the industry competitors. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, we don't manufacture on cars. Right. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  So I believe that 10 years from now, for example, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=791.84s)]
*  AV software is going to be built into every single car sold, every single new car sold. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=795.84s)]
*  And so we didn't want to essentially be in competition [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=802.76s)]
*  with the AV development environment. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=806.8s)]
*  And we wanted to we thought that our best place in the AV ecosystem [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=809.76s)]
*  is helping these AV developers who have spent now tens of billions of dollars [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=815.04s)]
*  in research, etc. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=820.24s)]
*  The cost of hardware is going to be more tens of billions of dollars. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=823.44s)]
*  It's it's we think what we can bring to the industry is monetization and go to market. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=828.08s)]
*  And so we have the essentially the network that will bring [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=833.04s)]
*  demand to AVs. We operate in over 70 countries. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=837.76s)]
*  We now have fleet partners all over the world who can essentially operate [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=843.2s)]
*  these fleets, depots, recharge, clean them, etc. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=847.76s)]
*  And we think that the demand that we bring to AVs [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=851.96s)]
*  can essentially help AVs develop, AV providers develop financing as well. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=856.92s)]
*  So that just like you can finance your car with a lease, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=862.4399999999999s)]
*  you'll be able to finance AVs as well. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=865.8s)]
*  So we think that's the best way to engage with the ecosystem. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  And just like we partner up and work with every car manufacturer out there, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=870.64s)]
*  we want to partner up with every AV developer out there, Waymo and many, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=875.88s)]
*  many others. And if anyone gets to Austin, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  Atlanta later this year, you'll be able to get Waymo's [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=884.44s)]
*  through Uber. And we think that's really the partnership model is really [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=889.6s)]
*  the right model going forward for us. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=893.72s)]
*  So I took a bunch of Waymo's in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  How many people have been in the cars? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=898.5200000000001s)]
*  And I know about any of you guys, but I sort of just I won't say [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=901.1600000000001s)]
*  the curse word on a stage was like Uber is Uber. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  Drivers are, you know, I was like, bye bye Uber drivers. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=909.0s)]
*  Like this was such a great experience. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  Why do I need a human driving this car for these, especially for the shorter [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=914.52s)]
*  terms, these shorter term trips? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=918.2800000000001s)]
*  Are you concerned about the economic impact that autonomous [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=920.72s)]
*  vehicles could have on human drivers? Definitely, definitely. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=924.32s)]
*  Now, I don't think it's something that's going to happen anytime soon. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=927.52s)]
*  The technology still is limited to very limited [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  originations, destinations, areas of operation. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  The mapping costs, the upfront costs are quite expensive. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=939.68s)]
*  The hardware platforms aren't there. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  And I think for the next 10 years, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=945.64s)]
*  you are going to have hybrid networks of humans and machines. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=949.52s)]
*  But, you know, you fast forward 15, 20 years. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=953.56s)]
*  I think that the autonomous driver is going to be a better driver [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=957.12s)]
*  than a human driver. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=961.32s)]
*  You know, they they will have train on lifetimes of driving that no person can't. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=962.24s)]
*  They're not going to be distracted. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=967.32s)]
*  And the fact is that when you look on a worldwide basis, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=969.12s)]
*  you know, there are over a million auto fatalities per year in the world. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=972.0400000000001s)]
*  So I do think it's going to make for safer trips. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=977.5200000000001s)]
*  But I do think that the the human displacement here, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=980.32s)]
*  while it's not something that is going to happen tomorrow, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=986.2s)]
*  is going to happen eventually. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=990.28s)]
*  And it's something that we have to think about society has to think about. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=992.48s)]
*  And some extent, it's part of our strategy. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=996.72s)]
*  As we think about our earners side is to diversify [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=999.64s)]
*  the kinds of earnings opportunity that our earners have. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1004.56s)]
*  So we started with driving, then we get on to delivery. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1009.24s)]
*  We have shoppers, for example. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1012.4s)]
*  We even have a group now that is labeling maps, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1015.56s)]
*  AI, et cetera, helping our companies in developing their algorithms, et cetera. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  So we are making investments in creating alternative methods [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1026.56s)]
*  of making money for our earner base. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1033.72s)]
*  Who's going to get there faster? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1036.8s)]
*  Are we going to get there faster in terms of more opportunity? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1037.96s)]
*  Or is AV going to get there faster? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1042.52s)]
*  But I think it's a real issue that you bring up. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think it's a tough one that we in society have to wrestle with. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1045.6399999999999s)]
*  And I don't have easy answers here. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1049.4399999999998s)]
*  I guess that's my answer to why I'm not going to become an Uber driver. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1051.52s)]
*  Well, I think over the next 10 years, it's a great gig. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1057.9599999999998s)]
*  It's a long career advice here. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1059.4399999999998s)]
*  Listen, I think any professional, you know, any kind of work right now, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1062.7199999999998s)]
*  at some point, I think it's going to start with augmentation. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1067.6399999999999s)]
*  And the augmentation is terrific. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1071.6399999999999s)]
*  And like the augmentation as it relates to safety, driving [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1073.04s)]
*  and these hybrid networks, the the autonomous drivers are going to take [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  the easier routes, et cetera. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1081.48s)]
*  But over a period of time, these are very tough questions [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  that we have to ask ourselves. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1085.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think the toughest question for me is that my Uber score is a four point [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  seven eight. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1090.32s)]
*  And I'm wondering if the robot drivers, the way most are going to also start [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1091.52s)]
*  to grade me as a passenger. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1095.0s)]
*  You know, we'll have to see about that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1097.56s)]
*  Yeah, defense. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1098.92s)]
*  You have to you have to close the door gently, etc. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1099.8799999999999s)]
*  How do I know it's going to be a model of pissing off the robot? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1102.12s)]
*  Right. Like I get to pick my music in the car, which is absolutely, you know, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1105.84s)]
*  it might be still offended if I have a phone call and they [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1110.12s)]
*  doesn't like the phone call. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1112.4799999999998s)]
*  You know, this might be [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1113.56s)]
*  you also announced this partnership with Nvidia. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1115.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. And that also seems quite unique because it doesn't involve [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  really your own technology, but you're using your own fleet. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1122.04s)]
*  Explain how this how this works. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1124.84s)]
*  Well, we partner up. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1126.8s)]
*  We're very excited about the partnership with Nvidia. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1128.4799999999998s)]
*  And for us and Nvidia, it's it's about [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  accelerating the AV industry generally and making sure [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1134.5200000000002s)]
*  that there are multiple winners in the industry. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1138.8400000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the Nvidia chips, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1140.72s)]
*  the chipset is incredibly powerful. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1143.2800000000002s)]
*  They have been investing heavily in AV technology. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1145.2800000000002s)]
*  And we have enormous amounts of data, right? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1150.44s)]
*  We've got millions of miles, millions of drivers that are driving now. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  So if you put combine our data [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1157.36s)]
*  with Nvidia's hardware and algorithms, you have a terrific [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1160.8s)]
*  combination to power other AV providers and the development of safety [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1165.76s)]
*  AV over a period of time. Fascinating. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1170.68s)]
*  And I want to go back to Elon for a second because they've announced [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1173.76s)]
*  their own robotaxes and their plans for that. Sure. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1177.48s)]
*  Do you see them as a competitor or a future partner? Yes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1181.08s)]
*  Yes, yes, both. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1184.28s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, I think, you know, what makes sense to all of these companies, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1187.6399999999999s)]
*  Tesla included, what we bring to the table is much higher utilization [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1193.56s)]
*  for the same reason that Uber driver joins Uber versus our competition. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1198.36s)]
*  You just get more work from Uber for that same reason. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1203.36s)]
*  It's going to make sense for AV companies [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1207.96s)]
*  to put their robots on the on the Uber network as well. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1212.08s)]
*  Now, they may not do so exclusively. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1215.8s)]
*  There are some drivers who multi-app work with competitors. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1218.6s)]
*  And then if you look, for example, on a delivery business and and by the way, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1221.52s)]
*  we do like sidewalk delivery robots as well. Right. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1225.68s)]
*  I want to talk about that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1229.64s)]
*  But if you if you look at that business, the big brands, right? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1230.44s)]
*  And Tesla is one of the biggest brands in the world [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1234.56s)]
*  are going to have a direct channel to consumers, just like McDonald's [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1237.64s)]
*  and Starbucks have their own app. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1241.12s)]
*  And at the same time, they're going they work with Uber Eats [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1242.84s)]
*  because they want to drive maximum utilization of these expensive assets. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1245.8s)]
*  And anyone who doesn't is going to be at a utilization disadvantage [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  and ultimately isn't going to be able to go to market as quickly as someone who does [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1255.1599999999999s)]
*  or finance their vehicles [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1259.2399999999998s)]
*  against someone who is on the network as well. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1261.84s)]
*  And so it will be cooperation that classic terms. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1263.9599999999998s)]
*  Tesla, at this point, their strategy has has been to do it alone. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1268.32s)]
*  But ultimately, we very much want to work with them. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1271.6s)]
*  And just like we want every safe, qualified driver on our platform, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1273.92s)]
*  we're going to want every safe, qualified robot driver on our platform as well. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1278.36s)]
*  So maybe this is have you talked to you about this? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  I have. He's he's busy right now. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1286.12s)]
*  He'll be less busy when he's when he doesn't have to drive. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1291.4s)]
*  His robot taxis are taking. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  He has full self driving. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1296.32s)]
*  I do want to talk about the the delivery robots that you have from Cerv. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  I think Ali's here on in the audience. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1302.1999999999998s)]
*  So he's the founder. Yes, he's the founder. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1306.12s)]
*  And I know you've got these delivery robots out in at least Los Angeles right now. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1307.84s)]
*  How's that going and where else are you going with them? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1313.1599999999999s)]
*  It's going really, really well. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1314.8s)]
*  So there are limitations to the delivery robots and that they [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1316.1999999999998s)]
*  and actually just describe what they are. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1320.72s)]
*  Yeah. So these are like boxes for how many wheels do they have? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1322.84s)]
*  Ali for wheels and they essentially. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah. Right. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1330.36s)]
*  Yeah. If you picture you got to work on your designers, beer cooler on wheels. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1331.9199999999998s)]
*  That's not very sexy. You got to work on that. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  But they're very, very cool. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1337.72s)]
*  And basically the the restaurant puts the food in the robot. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1339.72s)]
*  The sidewalk robot will go to the house. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1344.36s)]
*  They'll get a notification. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1347.3999999999999s)]
*  Person comes out, uses their app and opens the delivery robot and and takes their food. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1349.36s)]
*  It's a great experience. It's a delightful experience. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1355.76s)]
*  People think it's really cool. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1357.84s)]
*  There is because the delivery robots are using the sidewalk. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1360.04s)]
*  There's a limit in terms of the radius of of the delivery. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1364.2s)]
*  And just like we think that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1369.2s)]
*  our our passenger network is going to be hybrid. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1372.6799999999998s)]
*  To some extent, you see that hybrid in Los Angeles for short, short deliveries. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1376.68s)]
*  We'll use a serve robot for longer deliveries. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  We'll have drivers, et cetera. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1384.04s)]
*  And that hybrid network is going to continue to take shape over a period of time. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1385.72s)]
*  But it's been a great experience. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1389.8s)]
*  It's and the quality is there. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1391.24s)]
*  And the economics are already working, actually, which is pretty amazing. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1394.3200000000002s)]
*  Except there was this instance, I believe it was a couple of weeks ago [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1398.0800000000002s)]
*  where the Waymo hit the serve robot. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1400.96s)]
*  I hadn't heard about that. Yeah. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1404.3200000000002s)]
*  Who won? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1406.04s)]
*  I think it was the robot. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1408.68s)]
*  I think it was a bad day for robots. Oh, my God. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1411.2s)]
*  Let's let's move on to talking about human drivers in these last few minutes. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1414.84s)]
*  And we've talked a lot about some of the challenges that that human drivers have. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1419.0s)]
*  But whenever I do talk to Uber drivers, they still do have some concerns [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1422.32s)]
*  about pay, about insurance costs, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1426.28s)]
*  especially on my on my drive to the airport to Davos. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1430.16s)]
*  Uber driver. I asked him, what should I ask the CEO of Uber? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1434.84s)]
*  And he said, why is my insurance cost so high? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1438.52s)]
*  Yeah. So insurance is a really [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1440.7199999999998s)]
*  problematic issue in the US, especially and especially in California. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1444.8s)]
*  And the you know, just like you here in California with the fires, et cetera. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1449.32s)]
*  The cost of insurance has been increasing. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1455.32s)]
*  Probably the cost of personal automobile insurance has increased. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1459.28s)]
*  My guess is over the last three years by 50 percent. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1463.68s)]
*  It is incredibly difficult. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1466.76s)]
*  And it has caused us to raise prices [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1470.16s)]
*  for consumers. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1474.16s)]
*  And that money usually, you know, 80 percent of the take goes to the driver. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1476.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, more and more significant amount is going to pay for for insurance. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1480.28s)]
*  So we're hoping in California, a couple of other states [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1484.64s)]
*  to have discussions on tort reform, insurance reform, because [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1488.28s)]
*  some of the costs is just abusive practices by lawyers, et cetera. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1492.76s)]
*  It just shouldn't be there. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1496.08s)]
*  And it is another form of inflation that is deeply problematic. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1498.08s)]
*  So we're absolutely working with governments, et cetera, to solve that insurance problem. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1502.68s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1506.24s)]
*  And I guess we want to kind of end there, because we've talked about, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1507.76s)]
*  as they said at the intro, some of these challenges. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1510.48s)]
*  And you've you've pitched me on being an Uber driver, but we've now got [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1513.12s)]
*  the advent of AVs coming. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1516.64s)]
*  We've got rising costs of insurance, at least in the U.S. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1519.28s)]
*  Yes, I am taking a pretty U.S. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1522.2s)]
*  centric point of view here. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1524.2s)]
*  We've got EVs, which you really want people to take. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1526.16s)]
*  What is your best pitch to me as to be an Uber driver? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1529.72s)]
*  I think my best pitch to you is that everybody wants on demand everything, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1534.6000000000001s)]
*  on demand transportation, on demand delivery of food, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1540.4s)]
*  grocery, pharmacy. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1544.32s)]
*  And now we're actually powering other businesses in terms of real time delivery. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1546.12s)]
*  We want to empower the local merchant to Amazon, Amazon, Amazon, get it to you next day. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1552.36s)]
*  We essentially are providing logistics on demand for the Walmarts of the world, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1558.44s)]
*  for the apples of the world, but also small medium businesses. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1561.88s)]
*  And this idea of being able to push a button, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1565.64s)]
*  get to a place or get anything that you want immediately, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1569.12s)]
*  it will automate over a period of time. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  But the growth in the industry is pretty incredible. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1576.3200000000002s)]
*  And at least for the next 10 years, as far as I can see, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1580.16s)]
*  the future for us is challenging, but very, very bright. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1583.2s)]
*  One last question. What about drones? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1586.4s)]
*  Because of everything, some of those things you described, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1588.24s)]
*  the drones could bring it to me. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1590.6000000000001s)]
*  I think drones are absolutely going to be part of the solution. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1592.4s)]
*  And just like sidewalk robots, they're going to be part of the solution. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1595.3600000000001s)]
*  Drones are going to be a better solution as it relates to suburbs, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1598.8000000000002s)]
*  less dense areas where drones can fly safely and can land, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1602.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, let's say in a backyard, et cetera. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1607.72s)]
*  So I think ultimately, as it relates to delivery, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1609.76s)]
*  you're going to have a combination of sidewalk robots, humans, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1612.5600000000002s)]
*  eventually robot cars and drones as well. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1616.88s)]
*  And we will build that dynamic dispatch layer that based on the specific [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1619.72s)]
*  circumstance can decide what's the right way of getting the goods to you [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1623.96s)]
*  safely and as quickly as possible and as efficiently as possible. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1630.12s)]
*  Because I feel like in drones, we have this promise like five years ago [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1633.24s)]
*  that we were going to have drone delivery. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1635.96s)]
*  It's it's you know, the weight is an issue and obviously regulatory [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1637.32s)]
*  regulations are an issue, but the technology is absolutely getting there. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1642.04s)]
*  You know, the most advanced players in drones are the Chinese. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1646.12s)]
*  And so I do think that development of drones [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1650.72s)]
*  obviously is part of combat, et cetera, is going to accelerate. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1654.76s)]
*  Not for good reasons, but I do think when we look forward, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1659.0s)]
*  you know, probably in four to five years, drones are going to have a breakout. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1oK_zWAPNA&t=1663.8s)]
