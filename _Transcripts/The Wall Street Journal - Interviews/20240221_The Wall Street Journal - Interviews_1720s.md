# The Business of Weight-Loss Drugs Like Ozempic and Mounjaro | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk)
*  I thought we could start off by asking you as a medical expert how these drugs actually work in your body [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, we know they suppress appetite, but what are they actually doing? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Great question [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=11.1s)]
*  And I just want to take a step back and kind of frame the introduction of the drugs in the concept that obesity is a disease [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=12.08s)]
*  Because I think that's so important for understanding how they work and also the cost and who should be on them and you know [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  the societal implications [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=27.5s)]
*  So it turns out that our bodies regulate our weight in a very tight fashion [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=28.74s)]
*  so this is a physiologically regulated variable and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=35.06s)]
*  We have mechanisms to drive energy storage, you know eating food and we have mechanisms to stop ourselves from doing that and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=38.78s)]
*  GLP one is a hormone that our bodies make it's made in the intestine and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=48.14s)]
*  It's very interesting because in the pancreas it helps us secrete insulin in the brain [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=53.78s)]
*  It gives the signal to slow down eating and so GLP one receptor agonists are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=59.06s)]
*  medications that mimic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=66.66s)]
*  this hormone that we make and so [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=68.58s)]
*  originally they were developed to treat diabetes because of their effect on insulin and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=72.14s)]
*  Then it was you know also applied to obesity because they go to the brain and they tell our brains [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=76.78s)]
*  To slow down eating that we don't need any more fuel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=84.38000000000001s)]
*  So they suppress appetite [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=88.94s)]
*  They may also be having a lot of other effects which you know we can talk a little bit about [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  But that is the main way in which they work [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=96.18s)]
*  But a really important thing is that they don't they're not just effective for losing weight [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=98.94s)]
*  We really need to think of them in their importance for maintaining the weight that you lose [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=104.1s)]
*  Because really every individual has this weight set point. So a combination of genetics [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  hormonal biological environmental factors [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=116.66s)]
*  Which determines where our weight wants to be where our physiology is regulating our weight too [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=119.58s)]
*  And what these drugs do is they lower that set point? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  So by telling our bodies that we don't need to eat more they're also saying we're okay at this lower weight [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=129.62s)]
*  We don't need to invoke all of the mechanisms to go back to the higher weight [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=136.5s)]
*  And so they help people lose weight and they help the weight set point be lower [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=141.58s)]
*  So that we're not driving all of those eating behaviors. So if these drugs are lowering your set point essentially [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=146.74s)]
*  Does that mean [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  That if you go off them your set point will go back up and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=156.26s)]
*  In other words, does it mean once you're on these drugs if you want to maintain a lower weight [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  You have to stay on them for the rest of your life [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=164.46s)]
*  So this is such an important question and I think kind of a hotly debated one [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=167.1s)]
*  But in the scientific community, the data is very clear the medications work while you take them [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=172.46s)]
*  so again taking a step back we are programmed to store energy to survive and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=179.54s)]
*  So the reason we have this weight set point is to survive it drives the behaviors that we need to keep our stores in stock [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=185.9s)]
*  So when you lose a lot of weight in a way, it's even though it's often what we want for the individual [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=193.62s)]
*  It's in a way a physiologic crisis where our bodies are like, wait a second [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=198.96s)]
*  We don't have enough here and we invoke all of these mechanisms to gain weight back. For example, we drive hunger hormones [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=202.74s)]
*  We can measure these hormones. We know they're higher after you lose weight [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=209.98s)]
*  So what these medications do of lowering the set point that only works while you're taking the drug [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=213.78s)]
*  So that's kind of the theory behind everything, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=221.66s)]
*  You need to continue to take them for your body to continue to feel like we're okay at this lower weight [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=224.62s)]
*  We don't need to increase the hunger hormones and all those other things [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=229.78s)]
*  We also have scientific evidence because these trials have actually been done with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=233.98s)]
*  With samaglottide with go V and with trisipatide they've given the drug to people in clinical trials [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  They show significant weight loss results [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  Then when you stop the medication the patients in those trials regain the weight and that form [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  That's what we see when we treat patients if they have to have you know, a stop in their medication because of coverage or something like that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=255.17999999999998s)]
*  We see people start to regain the weight back [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=264.0s)]
*  So this is you know, really really important now [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=267.68s)]
*  We need more science and it doesn't mean that an individual patient can't work with their health care team [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  To try to do it to try to continue to do the behaviors that they've been doing on the drug and try to get off it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=278.0s)]
*  Or get on a lower dose [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  But as a kind of strategy, we know that you need to have continued use [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=285.72s)]
*  So form health is part of this new Lilly direct program, right? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=290.88s)]
*  You know, could you explain that partnership to us and you have said there's some misconceptions about it. So what are those? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=305.2s)]
*  So form has been very proud to be featured on the Lilly direct website and to be in this relationship with Lilly where [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  Patients are being exposed to the opportunity to get high high quality [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=314.88s)]
*  evidence-based clinical care [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  So really what this relationship is is trying to connect the patients who need obesity treatment [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  With a team that you know is able to deliver that care [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=330.04s)]
*  Where I have felt that there are misconceptions is that there are actually multiple aspects of this program [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=335.04s)]
*  On the lead direct there's also an opportunity to find not telehealth in-person [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=340.88000000000005s)]
*  Care teams and there's also a pharmacy where people can fill a script and it gets delivered to their home [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=347.56s)]
*  But form it's not a place where people come just to get us that bound prescription. We are very [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=356.0s)]
*  You know proud and also invested in delivering comprehensive care [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=363.36s)]
*  We believe that there are many tools in the obesity treatment toolbox [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  So people do not come for one prescription and that's it. We will you know [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=372.52s)]
*  Really understand each patient's medical history [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=378.6s)]
*  We will do comprehensive evaluations and we really arm them with all of the tools that are available to treat obesity [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is the goal to treat obesity and drive health, you know, not to give a specific prescription [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=388.24s)]
*  We use all of the medications not just Eli Lilly medications and our clinicians treat every patient the same [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=394.24s)]
*  We don't actually know at the clinician level where the patient came from. They may have been referred by a doctor [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=400.2s)]
*  They may have seen us on the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=405.88s)]
*  on Lily direct and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  We will explore all the options that the patient has and decide with them [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=410.84s)]
*  What the right treatment is for them? It may be no medication [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=415.52s)]
*  Some people don't want to use medication [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=418.8s)]
*  And it's very important to combine medications with nutrition physical activity [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  Behavior change to drive the best outcomes. How commonly are you prescribing? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=426.48s)]
*  You and your team prescribing is that bound and are you prescribing it more than we'll go V? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay, great question [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=438.2s)]
*  Again, you know, we really make the decision at the end of the day [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=444.64s)]
*  Again, you know, we really make the decision at the individual patient level and a big component of deciding the treatment is [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Understanding the patient what's the right treatment for them? And what do they want? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=455.0s)]
*  But then there are other aspects that also determine what the patient has access to some patients don't have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  Insurance coverage for certain medications, but you know, they do for some and not others [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=465.8s)]
*  Some and not others [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  So we're really kind of looking to understand the entire patient what they have, you know [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=473.36s)]
*  Access to from a medical perspective from a cost perspective and then trying to find their right treatment. So I [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=479.56s)]
*  Can't say we're prescribing one [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=487.24s)]
*  Type of medicine more than another type of medicine [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=489.88s)]
*  I can say that I think it's really important to be making the individual decision [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=492.72s)]
*  Sometimes there's an opportunity to switch treatments when patients aren't doing very well in one treatment. I think one thing that's not [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=498.12s)]
*  Very commonly advertised is that some people actually while these medications are phenomenal advancement [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=505.44s)]
*  Really a scientific revolution and you know, we'd love to talk a little bit more about that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=511.92s)]
*  They're driving such tremendous impact for many patients [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=516.88s)]
*  There are some patients who don't respond or don't respond optimally to a specific medication [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=519.64s)]
*  And we might consider switching them to another medication. So again, I think it's really about this individualization of care [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=525.52s)]
*  And I think you've told me before that actually most of your [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=533.12s)]
*  patients what percentage is it are are [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=537.12s)]
*  Are not on a GLP one. So what percentage is it that there are on GOP one at form? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=540.68s)]
*  10 to 15 percent of patients are not on medications at all [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  They're using the the what's typically called lifestyle tools to nutrition physical activity behavior [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  Big percent of patients are on older generic medications that cost less but they can help again [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=555.28s)]
*  We're trying to drive health and treat obesity not put people on a specific medication [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  So about 40 percent of patients end up on the GLP one receptor agonist class of medications [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=568.2399999999999s)]
*  And that's in part also again driven by coverage [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=576.88s)]
*  Because less than 50 percent of people in the US have coverage for you know, these newer more expensive [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  classic more expensive drugs [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=588.96s)]
*  Let's talk about [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=592.44s)]
*  You as a telehealth provider for a little bit [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=594.36s)]
*  So this question comes up all the time how as a telehealth provider do you evaluate? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  patients when people can lie about their way to qualify for a prescription [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  People lie about their weight all the time. That's true [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=609.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, okay fantastic question [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  Telehealth is a care delivery [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=618.76s)]
*  Mode, so all that telehealth means is how you're delivering the care to the patient [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  I think what's really really important is that we still think of this as [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=626.64s)]
*  medical care for a metabolic disease, which is obesity and so [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  You know at form what we're really interested in doing is expanding access to high-quality [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=636.72s)]
*  evidence based care and that is different from a mail-order prescription or [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=643.72s)]
*  You know fake knockoff of a prescription or something like that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=650.64s)]
*  So when we talk about telehealth [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=654.48s)]
*  We still wanted to meet all of the standards of high quality care that you would think of so the professional who's treating you [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=656.9599999999999s)]
*  Should have all the right credentials all of our physicians are board certified in obesity medicine [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=665.4599999999999s)]
*  You should be able to get in touch with the people who are giving you this prescription [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=672.54s)]
*  I mean these medications that we're talking about today are not without side effects and complications [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=677.66s)]
*  and so if someone is you know getting a [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=683.42s)]
*  Telehealth option where they can't even get in touch with the provider after they've been getting the prescription that is really concerning [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=687.66s)]
*  We review our at form. We review the patient's medical history [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=695.42s)]
*  We connect with the PCP and get records to really understand the person's medical history and be sure that this is [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=699.5799999999999s)]
*  You know safe and interacts actions with other medications and things like that and that's I think the kind of quality [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  Metrics that people should be [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=713.9399999999999s)]
*  Really looking for that it is, you know a high [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=716.06s)]
*  A [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=720.38s)]
*  Professional with the right credentials that you can get in touch with them [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  And I think it's so important to think about this the treatment of the disease [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=724.48s)]
*  I mean obesity is a disease, but it's also a risk factor for hundreds of other medical [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=729.02s)]
*  You know issues and so what we're thinking about is the whole health of the individual does this person have pre-diabetes [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=735.06s)]
*  Do we need to link into that does this person have sleep apnea? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=741.46s)]
*  Do we need to think about that and it's really thinking about the individual and how we can drive better health [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=744.42s)]
*  That is the focus as opposed to you know driving a specific number on the scale [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=750.22s)]
*  Well, how do you monitor their progress? I mean, okay, you're getting their records from their their primary care provider [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=755.18s)]
*  But once you're treating them, you're not seeing them in person [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=762.06s)]
*  So how do you how do you monitor verify the progress they're making like what tools yes do that? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=765.8199999999999s)]
*  We are seeing them on zoom [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=771.74s)]
*  So we do you know real video visits [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=775.86s)]
*  At form our patients have visits with their medical team and with a registered dietician and [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=779.52s)]
*  That is very important. But actually this is where telehealth [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=785.44s)]
*  I think is so exciting because the amount of data that we can collect from patients [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  Our patients get a digital scale and every time they step on the scale that gets translated to them in their app [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  And then to us and so we have a tremendous amount of weight data and also other biological factors [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=801.9s)]
*  That will enable us to really you know understand how people react to obesity treatment and and [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=809.08s)]
*  And how they do and we can also use the technology to give them [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=816.28s)]
*  You know educational modules that are really individualized to what they're going through at this step in the journey [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=821.1600000000001s)]
*  So telehealth definitely can you know help us attract people much more closely? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=826.96s)]
*  Than we used to do and the old days at brick-and-mortar, but also [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=833.76s)]
*  you know very importantly, I think the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=840.36s)]
*  The [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=844.4s)]
*  You know because you asked me kind of how'd you follow them? The emphasis is also on health markers [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=845.4s)]
*  Not just weight. So we are following [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=851.92s)]
*  metabolic markers for example hemoglobin a1c [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=855.6s)]
*  To watch their pre diabetes resolve or high blood pressure to or you know blood pressure metrics to see if their blood pressure medicines [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=858.68s)]
*  Their blood pressure is getting better. Thank you, and we may be able to take away [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=867.28s)]
*  Blood pressure medicines, which is you know one of the really great things about treating obesity [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=872.88s)]
*  To improve health is we can take medications away from people who no longer need them [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=878.88s)]
*  So demand is so as we said so intense for these drugs [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=883.6s)]
*  How long does it take right now for a new patient to get it an appointment with form health? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=888.2800000000001s)]
*  Great question we are we aim to see patients within about 10 days of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=895.2800000000001s)]
*  When we receive their medical records we do because we are trying to provide high quality medical care. We are [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=901.24s)]
*  Collecting information about the patient connecting as I said with their primary care doctor and [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=909.16s)]
*  You know gathering information we have to verify a lot of [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=914.52s)]
*  information about their insurance because our care is fully reimbursed by insurance and [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=918.96s)]
*  So all of that paperwork takes a little bit of time [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=923.4s)]
*  But after that we are able to see the patients very quickly. We've had a lot of interest in [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=926.28s)]
*  Patients coming to see us and so there is you know [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=933.32s)]
*  High demand right now. It may take a little bit longer during times like this and then we kind of settle back down to our goal [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=937.3s)]
*  Well and another question about demand is that you know, we know there have been supply constraints of certain drugs [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=944.54s)]
*  over time so can your [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=952.1s)]
*  What kinds of issues do your patients have filling their prescriptions? Can they fill them? Do you are you dealing with that a lot? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=954.1s)]
*  This has been you know, really really difficult because in some regards we are just in this incredible [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=960.42s)]
*  phase of having all of these new treatments for for patients and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=967.54s)]
*  one of the things we we didn't talk about is that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=972.62s)]
*  Actually, JLP one medications have been on the market since 2005. We had an early twice daily injectable [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=975.78s)]
*  approved in 2005 for diabetes in [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  In [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=987.0600000000001s)]
*  Around 2014 the first one was approved for weight loss. They are a glutide for treatment of obesity [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=988.3000000000001s)]
*  That's driving six and a half or so percent weight loss in [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=994.58s)]
*  2021 we get some aglutide approved for [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=999.26s)]
*  obesity and the average weight loss in trials is 16% and now with drosophila [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1003.3000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing an average of 20 to 22 percent weight loss [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1008.62s)]
*  So this has been such a remarkable evolution on the you know impact for patients that these drugs can drive [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  But at the same time we have significant access issues [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1018.9s)]
*  So there's the coverage issue that we've been talking about and then there are the shortages [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1022.9399999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I meet with a patient one of my colleagues might meet with a patient [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1028.3s)]
*  We might go through on comprehensive treatment plan to address all of the different lifestyle factors and decide that a medication is the right next step [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1033.06s)]
*  settle on which one [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1041.42s)]
*  after you know again considering a lot of options and then [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1043.26s)]
*  Realizing that we can send the prescription to the pharmacy, but the patient can't get that medication [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1046.7s)]
*  And so we're having to have be very creative [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1050.9s)]
*  Sometimes we have to use medications at a different dose than we would have chosen [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1055.14s)]
*  Sometimes we have to start on one medication and cross over [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1059.06s)]
*  to a different medication sometimes we can't use that medication for patients at all and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1062.7s)]
*  Very troublesome is when people lose access in the middle of treatment because of what we talked about before that in general [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1068.66s)]
*  when you come off medication your body drives your weight back up and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1075.5s)]
*  so [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1079.8200000000002s)]
*  You know someone having success using the medication for some time and then getting into a situation where lack of access [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1080.5800000000002s)]
*  insurance or [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1087.66s)]
*  shortages [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1089.02s)]
*  They have to go off the medication that is very very troubling [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1090.3000000000002s)]
*  Do you think we're gonna go to questions in a few minutes, so everybody prepare your questions for florencia, please [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1094.54s)]
*  Do you think Medicare will eventually cover the cost of these GOP ones? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1102.42s)]
*  Well, I truly hope so [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1107.82s)]
*  So Medicare has that because you know Medicare usually drives what other [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1109.82s)]
*  Right insurance companies will do [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1115.26s)]
*  Medicare has had for decades this kind of rule that it doesn't cover [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1118.1s)]
*  Medications for anorexia weight loss or weight gain [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  but I think really where we need to sort of shift is to see these as [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1125.84s)]
*  medications for obesity and the recent data that [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1131.3999999999999s)]
*  semaglutide lowered cardiovascular disease cardiovascular events and deaths by about 20% [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1136.96s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that we need to focus on we're treating a disease. We're treating the downstream complications as [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1141.96s)]
*  Opposed to the number on the scale [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1148.92s)]
*  Medicare covers bariatric surgery and there are other government bodies that cover including the VA system and the office for personnel management [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1151.4s)]
*  so I think we need to kind of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1159.56s)]
*  Standardize and move forward and there is a bill [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1163.4s)]
*  the treat and reduce obesity act is [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1167.08s)]
*  You know being proposed as a way to include and broaden access to obesity treatment [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1169.84s)]
*  Not just medications because it also includes the lifestyle piece but include medication [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1177.0400000000002s)]
*  Coverage so a couple minutes ago and we'll go to questions after this [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1183.7600000000002s)]
*  You walked us through how the these medications have changed over time and improved in their effectiveness. So I [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  Want to ask you what's in the weight drug? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1194.8400000000001s)]
*  Weight loss drug pipelined now, you know, what are we gonna see three to five years from now? Yes [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1198.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is really exciting and I think also really highlights why it's so important to work with a treatment team [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  Who are experts and knowledgeable in obesity because as I also mentioned before maybe patients will need [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1211.64s)]
*  Different medications or change over time. I see some really exciting broad categories [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1218.52s)]
*  First of all, GLP one is not the only access that drives weight regulation. So we're seeing development of drugs in different [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1223.68s)]
*  Classes we're learning that combinations of therapy often drives better results in [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1231.9s)]
*  Than single agents [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1238.18s)]
*  I think we're going to be able to focus on not just weight loss but quality of weight loss [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1240.46s)]
*  So some of the drugs in the pipeline are specifically [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1245.26s)]
*  Medications that will help boost muscle mass and there's been all this talk about you know, the concern of reducing muscle mass [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1249.3s)]
*  So that's very exciting [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1255.64s)]
*  Another really exciting thing is these are biologic the GLP one receptor agonists are biologic medications are very expensive to produce [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1257.06s)]
*  We're now seeing a small molecule production and you know data starting to come out on these this kind of class [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1264.54s)]
*  Could mean the cost comes down a lot [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1272.18s)]
*  And then finally kind of longevity treatments that last longer for already gone from twice a day injection to once a week injection [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1275.42s)]
*  but there are [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1283.02s)]
*  Studies thinking about driving gene therapy may be leveraging our own production of GLP one [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1285.18s)]
*  Stimulating with gene therapy to drive the production of GLP one in the body instead of taking it exogenously [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1291.06s)]
*  so there's just a tremendous pipeline of [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1297.74s)]
*  research development drugs and other strategies for treat obesity [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1301.86s)]
*  Which is really exciting really exciting for patients [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1305.78s)]
*  Who who have obesity and who really need [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1311.42s)]
*  these different treatment options and also really exciting for people in the field and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1315.02s)]
*  you know, my colleagues and I have formers just so excited to be able to continue to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1320.78s)]
*  Help the patient find the right treatment for that so much discovery about how this all works [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1326.94s)]
*  Biologically and so many new findings coming out. Yes, so let's go to questions [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1331.98s)]
*  Please raise your hand and a mic will come to you when it does, please [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1338.3s)]
*  Stand and give us your name and where you're from right here [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1343.44s)]
*  Right over here in the middle. Oh [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1350.72s)]
*  Okay, Esther Dyson wellville very briefly we've been talking a lot about costs and clearly they're likely to go down [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1359.1200000000001s)]
*  We also I hope we'll be talking about savings to make [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1367.52s)]
*  Some of these coverage decisions change [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1371.48s)]
*  How much and it's too early to tell there's a lot of issues about timing and long term and so forth [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1375.1999999999998s)]
*  But I'm sure somebody's already done a lot of little studies and counterfactuals about how much these stories could save [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1381.76s)]
*  That's a question [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1390.84s)]
*  Excellent, okay [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1393.8799999999999s)]
*  So I think what you probably mean is how much they could save in terms of cost to the health care system [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1394.6799999999998s)]
*  so we're [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1400.84s)]
*  starting to get information about we have longer term information about how [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1402.6s)]
*  Weight loss and treating obesity can help save costs, you know, and there's sort of different buckets [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1408.56s)]
*  I would say of how it can do that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1415.3799999999999s)]
*  one thing that we know is that obesity takes a huge toll on an individual and individuals with obesity are [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1417.34s)]
*  More likely to be absent to work, you know more likely to develop complex medical problems [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1424.6s)]
*  and so treating obesity is a way to make people be [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1429.72s)]
*  Healthier and prevent very costly, you know kind of medical treatments that they'll need during their lifetime [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  I think a great example is pre diabetes. You can reverse pre diabetes through weight loss. You can greatly [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1442.56s)]
*  Minimize risk that that person will go on to develop diabetes and diabetes is one of the most [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1449.8s)]
*  Costly diseases that you know, we deal with as a society so we can see the cost reduce in that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1454.76s)]
*  it's very hard to give you kind of exact numbers because [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1462.16s)]
*  you know again how much the medication costs is obviously a big part of this picture and we're [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1466.28s)]
*  Still figuring out what the actual costs of medications are. There's a whole, you know complex situation there and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1473.24s)]
*  Because we are starting to learn really important things for example the select trial results that just are very [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1480.28s)]
*  Recent and showed this reduction of 20% in cardiovascular disease [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1487.76s)]
*  We need more information like that about prevention of perhaps [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1492.2s)]
*  Prevention of kidney disease and all of the other things that are so expensive in society to treat [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1496.28s)]
*  So I don't think we know yet [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1500.9199999999998s)]
*  But I think that is a really critical question when we put this on the balance of you know [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1502.44s)]
*  What? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1508.76s)]
*  What what is this cost? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1510.32s)]
*  but again [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1512.04s)]
*  I always bring it back to we have to think about treating obesity as opposed to prescribing a specific [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1512.8799999999999s)]
*  Medication because there really are many options and there really are you know multiple evidence-based tools [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1518.9199999999998s)]
*  We have to put it all together to to really understand the costs what the cost can be. Yes [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1526.04s)]
*  We have another question over here. Yes, great [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1532.24s)]
*  Thank you [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1534.82s)]
*  Thank you [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1537.6599999999999s)]
*  You have to hold it I'm sorry [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1540.02s)]
*  I'm gonna talk a long time. I'm just want to thank you for the presentations and [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1542.58s)]
*  the previous [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1548.62s)]
*  speaker on health [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1550.54s)]
*  Inequity, I just wanted to give a different perspective [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1552.74s)]
*  Because my name is dr. Morvin Beverly [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1558.1s)]
*  President of Morvin Beverly MDP LLC patient engagement and cultural competence and my [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1561.38s)]
*  My way of looking at the process is from speaking to over a thousand patients from all ethnicity [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1567.38s)]
*  Across the large public health system, and I think we have to start looking at from health equity now [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1573.6200000000001s)]
*  There's nicer language. We started with health disparity now [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1580.16s)]
*  We moved to health equity and then there's not a non-compliant and non-adherent [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1582.98s)]
*  But what I call the boots on the ground solutions came from patients and I think we have to look from what's the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1587.82s)]
*  Perception versus the reality of the population serve if the perception is not the reality [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1595.3799999999999s)]
*  That patients or that population health is going to go south [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1601.34s)]
*  But if the perception and the reality is the same good bad happy or sad [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1604.78s)]
*  There's an opportunity to collaborate and the reason I say this and to understand that this is a fact the black [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1608.78s)]
*  Population has the worst health outcomes in all disease [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1615.42s)]
*  Categories and the elderly black population when you consider the atrocities that they endured they have the worst health outcome as well [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1619.66s)]
*  So and so I yeah, we have like 20 seconds left. Okay, would you like her to yeah? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1628.0200000000002s)]
*  I just want to just one other point cultural competence is not a part is the black population is not included and [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1633.66s)]
*  Just a quick the people that died in Brooklyn from all socioeconomics that were black Prince George County [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1640.22s)]
*  Have a large very affluent black community and kovat [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1646.82s)]
*  they had the worst health outcomes and so transportation runs to black and white Brooklyn and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1650.42s)]
*  Access to care got about 16 hospitals [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1656.26s)]
*  So we have to look at it from not just from that lens [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1658.9s)]
*  But a larger lens and to recognize that cultural competence have to apply to American-born [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1661.82s)]
*  Physicians to foreign-born patient but also foreign-born physicians to American-born [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1666.3000000000002s)]
*  Patient and American-born physicians to American-born patients were different than themselves. Thank you [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1670.94s)]
*  Well, I thank you [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1676.42s)]
*  I couldn't agree more that health equity has to be a central in this conversation [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1677.6200000000001s)]
*  and our mission that form as I said before is to expand access to obesity care and [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1681.98s)]
*  That's you know, we're saying the same thing. It has to be for everybody [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1687.9s)]
*  That's why we have to think about coverage in a way that's fair and equitable and [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1691.46s)]
*  Telehealth really allows us to deliver the care to all different parts [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1696.9s)]
*  There are a lot of places in the US where there are no obesity experts [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1701.02s)]
*  You know people have to drive a long time have to take off work to come to care [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1705.54s)]
*  So this is you know, thank you for highlighting these issues. I agree. This is how we have to be thinking about the problem [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3xad3JGwk&t=1709.46s)]
