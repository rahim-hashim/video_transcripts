# House Speaker Mike Johnson on Ukraine Aid, U.S. Border Measures and His Legislative Agenda | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74)
*  Well, tomorrow you'll be meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky as the debate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=0.0s)]
*  continues on aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=4.72s)]
*  What will your message be to him? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  My message to him will be the same as it's been to the President and to Senator Schumer [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  and all of our colleagues is that we understand the crisis there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=14.38s)]
*  I understand the necessity of ensuring that Vladimir Putin does not prevail in Ukraine [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=18.48s)]
*  and march through Europe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=22.94s)]
*  I'm one who believes he would probably go to the Balkans or somewhere else next. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=24.32s)]
*  And so this is an important battle for all the reasons we know. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=27.9s)]
*  But I don't think it is a radical proposition to say that if we're going to have a national [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=32.18s)]
*  security supplemental package, it ought to begin with our own national security first. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=37.14s)]
*  And so I'll explain to him that while we understand that, I've made my position very clear, literally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=42.26s)]
*  since the day I was handed the gavel, that we have to take care of our border first in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=47.58s)]
*  our country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  And that's what the American people, I think, demand, most of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  They're duly concerned about this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=56.86s)]
*  And I think we can do both things. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  But we really need the White House and the Senate Democrats to participate in that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=60.1s)]
*  And I think they will. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  So you just have a few more legislative days left this week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Are you comfortable leaving for the holiday break without passing legislation to provide [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  aid for Ukraine? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=75.78s)]
*  You know, President Biden says this will be a gift to Putin. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=76.78s)]
*  You heard Senator Klobuchar saying that the world is watching. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=84.06s)]
*  If the president thought it was such an urgent matter, he could have been dealing with this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  for the last six weeks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=89.18s)]
*  We've literally not had any movement from the other side. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=90.94s)]
*  And this is a deep concern to me, as it is to all of you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=95.06s)]
*  I want you to know that the day after I was handed the gavel, I went to the Situation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  Room and sat down with Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=102.18s)]
*  I've spoken to the Secretary of Defense about this, the Secretary of State. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=104.9s)]
*  You know, we have made the position very clear that we needed further clarity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=109.34s)]
*  Part of the problem with the Ukraine funding and the reason so many of the American people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  are concerned about it is that there's been no real clarity on what the strategy is, what [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  the end game is, how we'll have proper oversight over the dollars that have already been spent [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  or the money that's being requested now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=126.06s)]
*  I do not think it is an unreasonable thing to ask for those things. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=128.38s)]
*  So I've done it multiple times in the S.K.I.F., in the Situation Room, privately, publicly, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=131.78s)]
*  most recently late last week at the Congressional Auditorium in front of all of our peers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=137.22s)]
*  I said the exact same message that I've been saying since October 26th. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  And even as we sit here tonight, the White House has not provided that clarity. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=145.78s)]
*  I think the American people are owed that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=149.38s)]
*  In terms of the border policy, you said there are things that you want to see. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  The White House has said that the president has made clear he wants to make a deal, he's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=155.66s)]
*  prepared to make concessions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=159.98s)]
*  The White House has indicated they're prepared to make concessions on asylum specifically, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  which I know is a concern. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  What do you need to have in a deal to take it to your members? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=167.66s)]
*  Are there specific red lines for you? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=170.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, listen, the House's position is very well known. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=172.38000000000002s)]
*  We passed H.R. 2. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=174.78s)]
*  The House Resolution 2 was one of the top two provisions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=175.78s)]
*  And you know, we number legislation based upon its priority. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=179.22s)]
*  And I think that's more than symbolism. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=182.3s)]
*  It's really important to the American people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  That bill has a lot of important provisions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  It has asylum and parole reform, and those are critical components of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  But it also has a return to the Remain in Mexico policy, some completion of the wall. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  I mean, very basic things that make a big difference to stem the flow. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=198.46s)]
*  That's what matters. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=202.38s)]
*  It's not about further funding to process more people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  We had 12,000 people across that border Wednesday of last week in one day. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=206.94s)]
*  Twelve thousand people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=211.78s)]
*  We in October, November, December alone, three months, more people crossed illegally [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=213.34s)]
*  the southern border than did in any entire year in the Obama administration. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=218.54s)]
*  This is not a crisis. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=222.82s)]
*  It's a catastrophe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=224.06s)]
*  And we all know the negative effects that come from it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=225.42s)]
*  It is not unreasonable for the people's representatives in the House to demand that we get the border under control. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=227.38s)]
*  So are you saying that you have to get everything that's in H.R. 2 or a no deal? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  The position of the House is H.R. 2. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=236.42s)]
*  They've not come to us with any counter proposal, and they've known about this the entire time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=238.18s)]
*  So if there is a bipartisan Senate bill that passes, would you bring it to the floor, even if it doesn't have everything that your members want? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=242.06s)]
*  The devil's in the details. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=250.34s)]
*  And I've been very clear about that as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  I told Senator Schumer, I've told everybody at the White House. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=253.98s)]
*  I'm in good faith. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=256.82s)]
*  I'm an honest broker. You'll learn that about me. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=258.29999999999995s)]
*  I won't tell you something that is not true. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=260.78s)]
*  But the position of the House is that our members are very resolute on this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=262.9s)]
*  And and I don't think it's unreasonable. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=266.78s)]
*  We're applauded by our people when we go home to our districts and town halls. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  Everyone is concerned about this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=273.02s)]
*  The last couple of weeks, I've been in New York City. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=274.46s)]
*  Same concern, whether you're there, South Alabama or out west. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=276.9s)]
*  Everybody has the same concern because every state is a border state now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=280.17999999999995s)]
*  And we have to get control of this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=284.05999999999995s)]
*  And just to go back before we move on, you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=286.06s)]
*  You are comfortable leaving for break without passing anything [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=288.98s)]
*  that includes you. I'm uncomfortable about all of this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=292.94s)]
*  And that's why I think it's completely unreasonable [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=296.42s)]
*  that the White House is not negotiated with us at all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=298.9s)]
*  They've not given us any proposal at all. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  So it is not the House's fault. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=303.74s)]
*  It's the White House's fault. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=305.78s)]
*  And I mean, you know, that's the problem. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=306.9s)]
*  But come Friday, if there's no agreement, you guys will leave. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=308.82s)]
*  We're scheduled to be in until Thursday. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=312.78s)]
*  Everyone knows we have a historically small margin in the House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=315.38s)]
*  You know, could we come back the following week? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=320.1s)]
*  I would stay here indefinitely. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=322.58000000000004s)]
*  But I don't know that all of our colleagues will be able to do that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=324.18s)]
*  I'm not sure that some are willing on both sides of the aisle. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=327.38s)]
*  Again, the House has done its work here and we've been waiting [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=330.82s)]
*  on the other side and we've got nothing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=333.3s)]
*  Would you call them to come back? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=334.94s)]
*  Well, if a proposal was sent over and it's meaningful and reasonable [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=337.22s)]
*  and it looks like we could get consensus, I'm sure people would do the job. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  But we'll have to see. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=344.14s)]
*  And I mean, as of as of right now, we've got nothing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=345.5s)]
*  Looking into next year, you have funding deadlines looming. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, your majority will be smaller. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  What's the likelihood of a shutdown? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=355.38s)]
*  Would you work with Democrats again to avoid one? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  Of course, we'll work with Democrats. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  When we did the continued resolution, the latter or two tiered CR, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=362.82s)]
*  when we first proposed the idea of everyone balked and then they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=366.82s)]
*  came into agreement with it, we all worked together. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=370.5s)]
*  The reason that was so important and this is a big innovation. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=372.62s)]
*  We broke the Christmas omnibus tradition. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=375.7s)]
*  As long as I've been in Congress seven years and many years before that, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=378.58s)]
*  everyone in this room knows how this has been done. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  The Senate waits until right before the Christmas holiday. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=384.06s)]
*  They jam the house of the massive spending bill that's thousands [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  of pages in length that no one has read, understood, digested, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  much less debated or amended. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=393.5s)]
*  And then it spends like last year, one point seven trillion dollars. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=395.9s)]
*  So when they sprinkled a couple hundred billion on top, just for good measure. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=399.46s)]
*  We had an up or down vote. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=402.94s)]
*  That is no way to run a railroad. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=404.18s)]
*  The reason that we have almost 34 trillion dollars in federal debt [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=405.85999999999996s)]
*  and the terrible statistics that was just discussed in the last panel [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=409.46s)]
*  is because Congress has not been doing a good job of stewardship. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=412.82s)]
*  I think we owe the American people more than that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=416.02s)]
*  People in this room also understand, you know, the statutory law, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  the 1974 Budget Control Act has very specific deadlines, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=421.21999999999997s)]
*  processes and procedures in place that Congress is supposed to follow. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=424.78s)]
*  It's supposed to be 12 separate appropriations bills. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=428.29999999999995s)]
*  There's no muscle memory in Congress to do that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=431.3s)]
*  because it hasn't been done in so long. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=433.26s)]
*  What a radical proposition. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=434.82s)]
*  I want us to follow the law. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=436.26s)]
*  So the CR gets us into January and February. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=437.86s)]
*  We broke the Christmas omnibus pattern. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=441.14s)]
*  I think that was a big innovation and important step. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=443.78s)]
*  And now the hard work must be done to negotiate those individual bills. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=446.1s)]
*  I remind you, the House has already passed seven of the 12 bills [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=449.9s)]
*  funding about 80 percent of the government. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=454.42s)]
*  Eleven of the bills have been through almost the final stage of process, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=457.06s)]
*  if not passage on the House floor. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=460.42s)]
*  So far, the Senate has done three. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=462.18s)]
*  So we would like to get to the conference committees and negotiate all that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=464.62s)]
*  and figure it out. And we want to do that in earnest. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=468.02000000000004s)]
*  And we'll have a lot of important, quick work to do when we get back [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  after the New Year. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=473.42s)]
*  Do you think a shutdown can be avoided? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=474.42s)]
*  Oh, I sure hope so. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=476.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think operating by CRS and shutting down the government is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=477.26s)]
*  is a dereliction of duty. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's the way it's supposed to be done. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=483.74s)]
*  And what we're going to try to do in the coming year [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  is get us back to that process that the law requires, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=488.3s)]
*  that we won't be in this situation again. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=491.14000000000004s)]
*  I think that we can change the pattern here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think it will be a good thing for the American taxpayer [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=495.62s)]
*  to see that Congress is actually doing its job. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=498.98s)]
*  You mentioned the debt. So I wanted to speak about that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  You've laid out plans for a bipartisan debt commission. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about what that would look like? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=506.82s)]
*  How would it be different than previous commissions? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=509.42s)]
*  Are entitlements something that would be on the table? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=511.42s)]
*  Well, the commission, we've had a markup in the House Budget Committee. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=514.14s)]
*  I think the Senate is working on legislation as well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=518.14s)]
*  We'll get together on both of those and figure out the final mechanics of it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=521.14s)]
*  But it will obviously be bipartisan, bicameral, by design. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=524.58s)]
*  I think that they'll do some earnest work throughout the year. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=529.02s)]
*  And the idea would be to complete and publish a report [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=531.9s)]
*  with some suggestions, probably the early part of the following year. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=535.26s)]
*  And then I hope that we'll roll up our sleeves and begin to implement that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=539.34s)]
*  I don't want to prejudge what the outcome is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=542.18s)]
*  We do know that mandatory spending is a piece of this, of course, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=544.18s)]
*  you know, and everybody has to look at that soberly. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=547.9s)]
*  If we don't do something soon, talk about a dereliction of duty. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=550.66s)]
*  I mean, I just think that this it's it's almost immoral [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=555.02s)]
*  what Congress is allowed to happen. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think we have a real responsibility to fix it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=559.62s)]
*  And it's going to take tough decisions and hard votes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=562.3s)]
*  But, you know, I'm one who's willing to risk it all [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=566.1s)]
*  to make sure that's done, because that's our responsibility. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=568.3s)]
*  Another headline this week is the vote on the impeachment inquiry [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=571.1s)]
*  into President Biden. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=574.26s)]
*  I know you've explained this as a procedural step for that process. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=575.86s)]
*  But at this point, have you seen any evidence to lead you to believe [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=579.82s)]
*  that the president is guilty of impeachable offenses? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=583.74s)]
*  Well, I'm a constitutional law attorney. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=587.22s)]
*  I had the dubious distinction or the request to serve on the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  impeachment defense teams twice. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=594.22s)]
*  They did that to President Trump twice. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=595.7s)]
*  And that's not an expertise ever thought in law school. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=597.38s)]
*  I would need to develop. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=599.86s)]
*  But I was on record [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=600.66s)]
*  hundreds of times lamenting that that the Democrats [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=603.7s)]
*  and at that time, I think politicized impeachment, politicized the process. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think they did real damage to our system and the institutions [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=612.34s)]
*  in the in that process. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  Next to a declaration of war, I think the impeachment power [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=617.82s)]
*  might be the heaviest that the House has specifically, as you know, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=620.86s)]
*  under the Constitution that's given to the House. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=624.46s)]
*  And it's not something to be taken lightly. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=626.46s)]
*  I think that the House, it is incumbent upon us under the circumstances [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=628.94s)]
*  that are presented in this case to investigate properly, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=632.58s)]
*  do it methodically, slowly, deliberately, not in a political manner [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=636.5s)]
*  and to follow each truth where it leads. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=640.74s)]
*  I think we have a constitutional responsibility to do that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=642.5400000000001s)]
*  And the impeachment inquiry vote is the next necessary step [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=645.7s)]
*  to fulfill that constitutional responsibility. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=648.86s)]
*  It's not a political decision. It's a legal one. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=650.98s)]
*  And I've made sure my colleagues know where I am on that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=653.6600000000001s)]
*  We don't prejudge the outcome, but we have to continue. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=656.6600000000001s)]
*  The reason is, as you know, the White House has begun to stonewall [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=658.94s)]
*  that investigation. They're not turning over critical documents [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=662.22s)]
*  and they're not allowing witnesses to testify. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=665.22s)]
*  So when that's challenged in court, the House has to be at the apex [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=667.38s)]
*  of its constitutional authority. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=671.7s)]
*  And the way to do that is to have a floor vote. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=672.86s)]
*  And that's why we'll be doing that on Wednesday. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=675.6600000000001s)]
*  But at this point, where do you see the evidence? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=677.62s)]
*  Well, I just rotated off the Judiciary Committee to become [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=680.1s)]
*  Speaker of the House, and I enjoyed that job. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=683.54s)]
*  I like to be on Judiciary. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=685.78s)]
*  But judiciary oversight and ways and means have all been doing [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=687.54s)]
*  the investigation. And as you know, I mean, there's a couple of numbers [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  that stick out to me. I mean, 20 million, at least 20 million dollars [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=692.98s)]
*  flowed into the Biden family from foreign countries, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=698.06s)]
*  including Russia and China. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  We know that 22 times at least, President Biden [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=702.86s)]
*  either met with or spoke on the phone with business associates [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=706.78s)]
*  of Hunter Biden and James Biden. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=709.9s)]
*  We know that 16 times he's changed his story about that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=712.9s)]
*  He's lied to the American people about his knowledge of the business dealings. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=716.18s)]
*  This is compelling evidence. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=721.18s)]
*  And the more the bank records have come forward and the ways [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=722.38s)]
*  and means investigation and oversight, you know, as my friend [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=725.14s)]
*  Jamie Comer says, chairman of oversight, bank records don't lie. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=729.0999999999999s)]
*  He's right. John Adams said facts are stubborn things. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=732.02s)]
*  We have a responsibility to follow the facts wherever they lead. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  And we're still in that process. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=738.42s)]
*  And we'll see where it leads. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=740.7s)]
*  You recently endorsed former President Donald Trump. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=742.7s)]
*  How do you what do you envision in terms of a policy agenda? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=745.74s)]
*  Were he to be president again and you still to be speaker? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=750.82s)]
*  Have you two spoken about that? What would that look like? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=754.22s)]
*  Very briefly about it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=756.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's been pretty clear about what his position is. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=757.6600000000001s)]
*  He wants to do exactly the opposite as the Biden administration on, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=761.58s)]
*  for example, our energy policy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=764.82s)]
*  We want to have robust American energy policy again, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=766.54s)]
*  as we achieved during his first term. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=771.14s)]
*  He wants to return to the policies that worked. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=774.42s)]
*  He wants to obviously reduce the problem at the southern border [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=776.58s)]
*  and eliminate that problem. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=781.02s)]
*  He wants to return to the, you know, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act kind of ideas, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=782.1s)]
*  those policies to reduce regulations on business and job creators [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=786.18s)]
*  and entrepreneurs and risk takers to allow them to flourish again. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=789.86s)]
*  Look, if you rewind in your mind to right before Covid hit, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=793.02s)]
*  right before that, we had achieved the greatest economy [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  in the history of the world, not just the US. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=800.42s)]
*  We all know it. Every demographic was doing better. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=803.02s)]
*  And it was because of policy choices. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=805.6999999999999s)]
*  And so I think what President Trump will be resolved to do [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=807.4599999999999s)]
*  is return to those policies. And we want to help. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=809.8199999999999s)]
*  I think Congress has an obligation to turn back to that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=812.3s)]
*  so that we can enjoy the prosperity and liberty and security [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=814.66s)]
*  that we had during those years. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=817.62s)]
*  Would a national abortion ban, like the 15 week bill, for example, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=819.58s)]
*  would that be on the agenda? Do you think? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=823.58s)]
*  There's no national consensus on abortion. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=825.58s)]
*  When Dobbs was overturned, the obviously the decision [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=828.5s)]
*  returned to the states. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=831.38s)]
*  I mean, I'm a pro-life person, but also I'll often think about [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  what Breitbart observed. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=836.82s)]
*  He said politics is downstream from culture. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=838.1s)]
*  And if you don't have a cultural consensus on a sensitive issue like that, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=840.7s)]
*  I don't foresee Congress moving legislation on it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=844.38s)]
*  We need to build consensus nationally. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=847.4599999999999s)]
*  And right now, the states are all over the map on it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=849.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump recently said in an interview that he would be a dictator on, quote, day one. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=852.9399999999999s)]
*  You just described yourself as a rule of law guy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=857.54s)]
*  I'm just wondering what your reaction is when you hear things like that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=859.4599999999999s)]
*  I think he was kidding. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=862.14s)]
*  I think he was talking about executive orders on the border and energy policy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=864.14s)]
*  I didn't hear the quote, but I can I can imagine how that went. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=867.8599999999999s)]
*  Look, the executive orders have been abused, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  Everybody knows that the Biden administration, I think, is the worst [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=876.5s)]
*  defender in history, and I think the numbers show that I am a rule of law guy. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=879.34s)]
*  I'm a constitutional guy. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=883.94s)]
*  I'd like to call back Article One powers and get this thing restructured. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=886.1s)]
*  But I understand his zeal about that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=889.86s)]
*  He's so frustrated as we all are in the energy sector, for example. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=891.78s)]
*  I hate to keep hitting the issue, but it's so very important. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=895.54s)]
*  Energy policy is national security policy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=898.18s)]
*  And what we've done in that space is maddening to me [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=901.1s)]
*  in the border the same way. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=905.1s)]
*  So I think those were the two issues he was referring to. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=906.3s)]
*  But I don't think he intends to be a dictator. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=908.66s)]
*  And I would not participate in such. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=911.26s)]
*  And in all these issues you're working on, you're dealing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=914.3399999999999s)]
*  with a very challenging caucus, obviously. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=917.5s)]
*  What's your approach to managing the different factions of the party? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=920.18s)]
*  Well, as we say in my household, sometimes we have intense fellowship. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=924.9799999999999s)]
*  We don't argue. We have intense fellowship. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=928.5799999999999s)]
*  We had some this afternoon on some contagious issues. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=930.5s)]
*  Look, democracy is messy. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=934.02s)]
*  Congress is an institution that is built to have intense [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  debate and and deep philosophical differences amongst members. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=940.0999999999999s)]
*  And then the idea is you sit around a table and you arm wrestle sometimes [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=944.26s)]
*  and you work out consensus to move the ball forward for the most people to do the best. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=948.42s)]
*  And that is the process you're seeing in earnest. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=952.3s)]
*  We're in an interesting time in our politics. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=955.2199999999999s)]
*  We all recognize it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=956.8599999999999s)]
*  It's a 24 hour news cycle, 24-7, you know, social media. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=957.5799999999999s)]
*  In the old days, if you were elected to Congress and you were just kind of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=963.4599999999999s)]
*  a newer member, a rank and file, you know, you would sort of take your seat [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=966.3399999999999s)]
*  in the in the back and and allow things to play out. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=969.78s)]
*  You were often a team player. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=973.5799999999999s)]
*  The only persons that got any press were the top three officers, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=975.42s)]
*  you know, in your party in that chamber. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=978.5799999999999s)]
*  And in most of your comments weren't known or heard by anybody [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=980.6999999999999s)]
*  except maybe your local newspaper. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=983.74s)]
*  That's all changed now. Right. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  And with social media, everyone has a potentially a giant platform [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=986.8599999999999s)]
*  and and everyone has feels this need all the time, all throughout the day [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=991.1800000000001s)]
*  to share their views on everything. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=995.1800000000001s)]
*  It makes it complicated. Right. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=997.22s)]
*  When the founders put in their in their wisdom, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=999.22s)]
*  when they put this matchless constitutional system together, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1002.74s)]
*  when they had checks and balances, separation of powers and the two [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1005.98s)]
*  bicameral legislature, they could never have conceived [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1010.26s)]
*  the environment that we would serve in as we do today. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1014.34s)]
*  And so we have to adapt to that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1017.9s)]
*  So, look, I'm very bullish on the future of America. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1019.02s)]
*  Let me just say, I think our best days are ahead of us. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1021.5799999999999s)]
*  And that is not a talking point. I feel it in my heart. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1023.9399999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to get through this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1026.42s)]
*  But we've got a tough patch here, a valley to get through. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1028.06s)]
*  I think it's I think the next Congress is going to be a lot more fun [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1030.74s)]
*  for my team because I think we're going to expand our majority [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1034.1s)]
*  and I'll have more than just a two or three vote margin [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1036.98s)]
*  on some of these tough things. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1039.62s)]
*  How bullish do you feel on the future of staying in the speakership? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1040.98s)]
*  Oh, I'm very bullish on that. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1044.5s)]
*  The motion to vacate, you know, is what it is. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1049.46s)]
*  It's a sort of Damocles that would hang over the head of any speaker [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1053.98s)]
*  going forward. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1056.54s)]
*  I think there's a lot of talk and consensus amongst our colleagues, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1057.62s)]
*  really on both sides of the aisle, of raising the threshold [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1060.3s)]
*  because of this kind of new era that we're in. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1062.74s)]
*  You know, I'm tired of making history, you know, this Congress. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1066.42s)]
*  I mean, we do lots of unusual things now. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1069.3s)]
*  We've changed a lot of norms and traditions. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1072.26s)]
*  And as an old school kind of constitutional law guy, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1074.5s)]
*  that it's uncomfortable to be a part of that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1077.38s)]
*  So I'm trying to convince my colleagues to get back to some sense, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1081.66s)]
*  semblance of regular order, regular process, the way that this is supposed [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1084.8600000000001s)]
*  to work. And let's stop making history on some of these things. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1089.46s)]
*  I don't want to be the first on anything else. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1094.0200000000002s)]
*  You said you feel confident about the majority going forward. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1096.1000000000001s)]
*  What's giving you that confidence that you guys can keep the majority [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1100.5s)]
*  in the next Congress? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1103.74s)]
*  Yeah, I've been out traveling the country and I feel in the in the in the base [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1105.3s)]
*  of the Republican Party, but also larger than that. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1109.4199999999998s)]
*  If you look at polling and we don't all put a lot of stock in polls anymore. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1112.34s)]
*  But I mean, if when you go out and you're out in the country [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1115.4199999999998s)]
*  and you're just meeting hardworking American folks and families, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1118.3s)]
*  they're struggling right now. They're struggling with the cost of living. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1121.94s)]
*  They're struggling with the mortgage interest rates. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1124.6599999999999s)]
*  They're struggling with, you know, they're concerned about safety and security. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1127.1s)]
*  I talked to moms and grandmothers that are just like my own wife. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1130.7s)]
*  They're worried that when they send their children off to the bus stop, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1134.54s)]
*  that they want to make sure they're not going to be abducted. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1137.34s)]
*  When they make it to school, they want to make sure they're not going to be [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1139.42s)]
*  indoctrinated. They want to make sure that their teenagers aren't going [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1141.62s)]
*  to get poisoned by fentanyl that's flooded on the streets of every community [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1144.26s)]
*  in America because of the open border. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1147.26s)]
*  They want to make sure that when they graduate from school, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1148.7s)]
*  they'll actually have an opportunity to get a job and not be drowned [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1150.82s)]
*  with student loan debt. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1153.78s)]
*  You know, these are real concerns of real people. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1155.06s)]
*  They do not feel like things are going well. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1157.1s)]
*  And what I'm excited about is we go out into that environment [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1159.86s)]
*  and we provide answers, solutions. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1163.18s)]
*  I mean, I believe in these core principles that we're advancing. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1165.02s)]
*  And I know that it can it can turn America around. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1168.26s)]
*  We can we can fix this. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1171.54s)]
*  We can ensure liberty, safety and security and opportunity again. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1172.94s)]
*  But again, it comes down to policies. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1176.94s)]
*  And so that's what we're encouraging our candidates to go and talk about [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1178.66s)]
*  and talk about it in the right tone. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1182.26s)]
*  And I think it really resonates with people because they know [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1184.6200000000001s)]
*  we have to have a change. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1187.5800000000002s)]
*  One more on 2024. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1189.3400000000001s)]
*  If President Biden won the 2024 election, would you certify the results? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1191.7s)]
*  Sure, of course, if it's a fair election, we assume it will be. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1195.98s)]
*  I'll tell you, every town hall that I'm in, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1199.14s)]
*  the first or second question is asked no matter where we are in the country. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1201.5s)]
*  The first or second question is about election security. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1204.94s)]
*  People are on both sides are concerned about that. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1207.66s)]
*  I do think a lot of great work has been done since the 2020 election [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1211.0600000000002s)]
*  in states across America. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1214.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, hundreds of pieces of legislation were passed [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1216.14s)]
*  by state legislatures and signed into law to improve the process. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1219.38s)]
*  There are always concerns in certain areas, but I think there'll be [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1223.3400000000001s)]
*  lots of eyes watching it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1226.38s)]
*  And I'm certainly hopeful that we'll have a free and fair election. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1227.66s)]
*  I mean, it's essential to our system. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1232.2600000000002s)]
*  But yeah, we're counting on that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1233.5800000000002s)]
*  But I don't think Biden's going to win. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1234.7s)]
*  I think it'll be the other guy. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1236.22s)]
*  Turning to another topic, I know you've raised concerns about [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1238.38s)]
*  anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1241.0200000000002s)]
*  The president of the University of Pennsylvania stepped down [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1243.38s)]
*  following criticism of her testimony at a congressional hearing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1246.3400000000001s)]
*  Do you think the presidents of Harvard and MIT should also resign? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1249.3400000000001s)]
*  I saw highlights of that tape. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1253.5s)]
*  I don't have a lot of time to sit around and watch the hearings right now. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1255.6200000000001s)]
*  But but I was talking with Elise Stefanik, the chair of our [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1258.1000000000001s)]
*  Republican conference today, who was largely responsible for evoking those [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1261.46s)]
*  those answers that were just shocking. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1265.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I so much has been said about it, and it's all right. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1267.5s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a symptom of a larger problem. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1270.5800000000002s)]
*  I think it's what happened at a lot of these higher ed institutions [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1273.54s)]
*  they've just been completely given over to this sort of. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1276.42s)]
*  I mean, it really is almost indoctrination. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1279.66s)]
*  This this agenda, you know, starts with DEI and leads into all these other things. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1281.46s)]
*  And it's an incredible double standard because these same people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1285.34s)]
*  who would tolerate that are in the business of censoring and silencing [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1289.14s)]
*  in so many cases, conservative viewpoints. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1293.54s)]
*  And it just shows the hypocrisy and it's laid so bare. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1295.34s)]
*  So I don't think that's the right kind of leadership. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1297.78s)]
*  If you can't say that the call for the genocide of the Jewish people [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1299.9s)]
*  is a violation of your values and your code of conduct, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1303.3s)]
*  there's a problem. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1305.78s)]
*  And look, I think the attention is is due. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1306.74s)]
*  You think those presidents should go? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1310.3s)]
*  I think they should. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1311.78s)]
*  You describe yourself as a man of faith [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1314.34s)]
*  and that your faith informs everything you do. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1316.62s)]
*  Could you talk to us about how it guides your work as speaker? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1319.46s)]
*  You sort of how it affects your day to day? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1323.02s)]
*  Well, sure. I mean, look, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1325.74s)]
*  much has been made about this idea that I'm a Bible believing Christian. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1327.46s)]
*  I mean, everybody here understands that everyone who comes to Congress [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1331.5s)]
*  operates from a certain worldview. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1335.22s)]
*  Everybody has deep convictions and philosophies that they operate under. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1336.58s)]
*  I don't think it might have, at least in previous generations, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1340.74s)]
*  wouldn't have been all that controversial at all. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1344.1000000000001s)]
*  I think I think it's good to have people of faith serving in office [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1346.5s)]
*  because if they believe they answer to a higher power, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1350.22s)]
*  that's really important in terms of accountability. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1353.02s)]
*  That's certainly what the founding fathers believe, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1355.58s)]
*  the founders of this country. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1357.22s)]
*  They wanted a vibrant expression of faith in the public square [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1358.18s)]
*  because they felt like that that morality and virtue found their seedbed [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1360.66s)]
*  in religion. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1364.74s)]
*  I don't believe in imposing some sort of national. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1366.22s)]
*  Everybody said, oh, he's a Christian nationalist. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1368.58s)]
*  I don't even know what that means. It's nonsense to me. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1370.3s)]
*  We respect all people of faith. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1373.14s)]
*  That's the beauty of America. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1374.78s)]
*  And it's a really, really important part of our of our tradition [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1375.98s)]
*  and our in our heritage in this country. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1379.58s)]
*  And so I operate from a perspective of faith and it informs [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1381.58s)]
*  how I think about issues. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1385.82s)]
*  But I'm one member of a large legislative body. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1386.98s)]
*  And as you've seen in recent days, it's very difficult to forge consensus [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1390.14s)]
*  on anything. And so whatever people's philosophies or traditions [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1394.66s)]
*  or ideas are, we've got to we've got to get majorities and build consensus. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1398.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's what I try to do every day. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1402.5400000000002s)]
*  Do you believe in the separation of church and state? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1403.94s)]
*  Yeah, much has been said about this as well. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1406.8600000000001s)]
*  Look, I used to be a religious liberty defense litigator. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1408.66s)]
*  I went to court to defend this idea [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1411.14s)]
*  of protecting the expression of faith in the public square. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1414.1000000000001s)]
*  But the separation of church and state is I called a misnomer [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1416.78s)]
*  because it's widely misunderstood by a lot of Americans. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1420.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, it's not in the Constitution. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1422.98s)]
*  It comes from a phrase in a letter that Jefferson wrote to the Danbury [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1424.18s)]
*  Baptist Association in 1801. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1427.6200000000001s)]
*  And the Baptist asked him the question. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1429.78s)]
*  They were so concerned that the government was going to encroach [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1432.14s)]
*  on their ability to practice their faith. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1435.0600000000002s)]
*  And he wrote back a letter of assurance and said, no, don't worry about that. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1436.9s)]
*  There's a separation there. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1440.26s)]
*  There's a wall and it protects you from encroachment by the state. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1442.3400000000001s)]
*  That's what he was talking about. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1445.9s)]
*  What's happened in recent generations is the phrase has been turned on its head. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1447.6200000000001s)]
*  And instead of being seen as a shield for people of faith, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1452.06s)]
*  it's been used as a weapon against them to censor and silence them. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1455.7s)]
*  I went to court for 20 years to defend that from happening. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1458.5800000000002s)]
*  But it but it did for a long, long time. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1462.3s)]
*  So, I mean, the point is that, I mean, the First Amendment, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1463.78s)]
*  the first freedom that we have in the Bill of Rights is the right [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1467.82s)]
*  to free exercise of religion. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1470.5s)]
*  We don't have establishment of religion. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1472.14s)]
*  We don't establish one religion. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1473.54s)]
*  We want everybody to freely exercise their faith [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1475.22s)]
*  because it's so important to who we are as a people. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1477.94s)]
*  I'm going to see if there's any audience questions in a moment, but [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1480.42s)]
*  I'd love to know you're six weeks into the job. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1483.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously, you were surprised. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1486.46s)]
*  Arise to speaker. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1488.3000000000002s)]
*  What has surprised you about this? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1490.1000000000001s)]
*  And what have you learned since you've taken on this role? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1492.0600000000002s)]
*  It's been surreal. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1495.94s)]
*  I think I'm six weeks and a few days into it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1497.0200000000002s)]
*  In some ways, it feels like six months. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1499.7800000000002s)]
*  Somebody says, like drinking from a fire hose. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1502.3000000000002s)]
*  I said, no, it's like drinking from Niagara Falls [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  while you're being kicked in the gut at the same time. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1506.9s)]
*  It's it's been busy. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1509.7800000000002s)]
*  The most surprising thing is how much really authority [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1511.42s)]
*  the speaker's office has, how many responsibilities, and it all has to be done [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1515.74s)]
*  simultaneously. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1519.02s)]
*  Normally, when someone is going to be speaker, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1520.42s)]
*  but he sort of understands that well in advance. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1522.74s)]
*  And so that individual has an opportunity to build a team and a processes [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1524.7800000000002s)]
*  and put all the procedures in place. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1529.3000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, we did it midstream. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1530.94s)]
*  And so I was building the plane while we were flying it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1533.1000000000001s)]
*  And so the first few weeks were tough. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1535.86s)]
*  I was four inches taller when I took this job. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1539.58s)]
*  I've been beat down mercilessly. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1541.5s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1543.74s)]
*  They can't hurt my feelings. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1544.98s)]
*  I had those surgically removed back in the 80s, so you can't hurt my feelings. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1546.1s)]
*  And all those things come in handy right now. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1549.22s)]
*  But look, it's the honor of a lifetime. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1551.02s)]
*  It's not a job that I ever aspired to. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1554.22s)]
*  I didn't see this coming. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1556.4199999999998s)]
*  And I've been I'm grateful that my colleagues entrusted me with it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1557.86s)]
*  And I want to do a good job for him. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1561.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm just I'm trying to be a servant leader. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1562.62s)]
*  And part of that is the way we operate the office is that I don't [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1564.82s)]
*  I don't want it to be a top down kind of organization. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1568.3s)]
*  I really want to involve the members and the body more and the big decisions [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1571.22s)]
*  and decentralize the power of the speaker's office, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1575.3s)]
*  because I think that's really important. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1577.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think that that really follows what the framers intent was. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1578.54s)]
*  Have you spoken to many past speakers to ask advice? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1581.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I have. And they all have ideas, of course. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1585.1s)]
*  And and really wise counsel. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1588.1s)]
*  And and even, you know, more senior members of Congress [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1590.3s)]
*  who have good ideas and have been around and seen things. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1594.4199999999998s)]
*  And I'm always open to that. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1596.8999999999999s)]
*  And you give honor where honors do. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1598.54s)]
*  I'm looking to see if there's anyone in the audience. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1601.02s)]
*  I see a hand right here. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1603.3s)]
*  I think someone's going to come give you a microphone. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1605.58s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, you've got a very tough job and thanks for coming here tonight. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1610.6599999999999s)]
*  Look, the Ukrainians aren't just fighting for their own freedom. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1614.46s)]
*  They're fighting for everyone's freedom. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1619.9399999999998s)]
*  And Ukrainians are fighting and dying so that Americans and Britons [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1621.82s)]
*  and Australians don't have to fight and die. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1625.82s)]
*  I absolutely take your point about the need to sort out the chaos on the border. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1629.22s)]
*  But just because you can't get both things right, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1636.26s)]
*  isn't it better to get one thing right? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1641.1s)]
*  So could I please appeal to you? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1644.1s)]
*  Please don't go home for Christmas without at least giving the Ukrainians [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1646.5800000000002s)]
*  what they need to fight for their freedom. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1651.98s)]
*  Listen, I hear. Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1654.1000000000001s)]
*  You've echoed the request that I've made to the White House [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1662.94s)]
*  since October 26th and that morning, and they've not come forward to help in any way. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1665.14s)]
*  I know Ukrainians are dying, but you know that fentanyl is the leading [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1669.74s)]
*  cause of death in the US for Americans aged 18 to 49. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1672.8200000000002s)]
*  The leading cause of death. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1675.7s)]
*  And the reason it is is because the border is wide open [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1677.3s)]
*  because it comes from China's process in Mexico and they sent right into our country. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1679.54s)]
*  We have to fix our own border. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1683.74s)]
*  It's not it should not be a controversial notion. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1686.22s)]
*  We should have done it a long time ago. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1688.7s)]
*  And the interesting thing about this is that it's a policy change. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1690.02s)]
*  It's very simple to do that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1693.22s)]
*  The president could easily do this, but they are unwilling. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1694.5s)]
*  And I cannot for the life of me understand why. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1698.02s)]
*  So we're going to take care. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1700.38s)]
*  We'll take care of our obligations. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1701.54s)]
*  But when I go home, the American people, my constituents and constituents [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1703.18s)]
*  all around this country are demanding that we get control of that border. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1707.26s)]
*  And we can do both. We can do both. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1711.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, I agree. I agree. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1715.5800000000002s)]
*  I think I see another hand over here. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1717.14s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Speaker. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1722.5s)]
*  My name is Sid Wilson. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1723.54s)]
*  I'm the president and CEO of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1724.66s)]
*  Can you clarify your comment that you just shared about [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1729.22s)]
*  higher education, diversity, equity and inclusion? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1733.26s)]
*  And what exactly is your position on it? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1736.0600000000002s)]
*  And why given the movement to dismantle [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1739.22s)]
*  a program or initiative that is supported through just underrepresented communities? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1744.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, look, the the the emphasis of DEI, I think, has been [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1750.1000000000001s)]
*  I think it's been run amok. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1755.5s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what the experience shows us. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1756.7s)]
*  My problem with all that is the, as I said, is the hypocrisy of it, right? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1759.38s)]
*  Because while they will enforce speech codes against conservative viewpoints, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1763.1000000000001s)]
*  in this case, when there is calls for the actual genocide of the Jewish people, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1768.38s)]
*  they seem to have no problem with it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1773.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, speech codes are a dangerous road to go down. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1775.8200000000002s)]
*  Right. We respect the free marketplace of ideas and we respect all people. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1780.14s)]
*  All people should be given dignity and respect. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1785.94s)]
*  That's an American value. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1788.1799999999998s)]
*  But I just think some of these policies, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1790.34s)]
*  the way they've been implemented, has created this problem. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1792.98s)]
*  The idea that a college professor, a university professor, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1795.58s)]
*  could not testify under oath to a congressional committee [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1798.58s)]
*  and say clearly, unequivocally that that is evil and wrong is beyond me. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1802.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1807.34s)]
*  And all I can subscribe it to is the enforcement of these policies, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1808.34s)]
*  because I think that's where things started to go off the rails. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1811.06s)]
*  It wasn't about this, but the hearing about the anti-Semitism. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1813.78s)]
*  It's given the fact that DEI normally impacts blacks, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1817.1399999999999s)]
*  Latinos, LGBTQ women. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1821.3s)]
*  Can you talk about that group? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1825.06s)]
*  Because that's where the majority of DEI impacts. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1827.18s)]
*  Everyone should be treated equally and judged by their color, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1829.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, by their content, their character, not the color of their skin. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1833.22s)]
*  I mean, that's the promise of the DEI. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1835.94s)]
*  That is what Martin Luther King Jr. used to talk about all the time. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1839.42s)]
*  That is what we're trying to do to make a more perfect union. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1842.38s)]
*  And I think by dividing people, I think that is part of the problem. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1845.8600000000001s)]
*  I think we should all be seen as Americans. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1851.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, that used to be the value that we were aspiring to. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1853.5800000000002s)]
*  And I feel like some of these policies have gone too far. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1856.0600000000002s)]
*  And they've made people see one another as categories, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1858.5800000000002s)]
*  instead of all being seen as different. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1862.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the problem. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1865.14s)]
*  As categories, instead of all being Americans and neighbors and friends. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1866.94s)]
*  I mean, to me, that maybe that's an oversimplification, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1871.22s)]
*  but that's the problem. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xiyl140t74&t=1873.8999999999999s)]
