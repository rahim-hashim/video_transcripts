# Behind Googleâ€™s Accelerated AI Push with New System Gemini | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE)
*  I think the last time we talked was almost a year ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=0.0s)]
*  and it was right before Google launched Bard. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=3.5s)]
*  Now, we're here and Sundar said, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=6.5s)]
*  it's the Gemini era. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=10.16s)]
*  You just announced a bunch of new products around Gemini, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=11.6s)]
*  including a subscription version. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=15.36s)]
*  So tell these people what they should know about Gemini. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=17.0s)]
*  What is this Gemini era that we're in now? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=20.36s)]
*  For a while, I can't believe it's been a year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=23.12s)]
*  It feels like it's been longer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=25.0s)]
*  So Gemini is the most capable model [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=27.92s)]
*  that we've built at Google, in Google DeepMind, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  in collaboration with other parts of Google, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=34.04s)]
*  like Google Research. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  And it's a multimodal model. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=38.24s)]
*  And as you mentioned, it's available through an app, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=40.36s)]
*  through enterprise, and developer endpoints [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  in Google Cloud. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=46.28s)]
*  And then we're integrating it into our products and services [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=48.28s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  So search, generative experience, and workspace, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  and so on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=55.24s)]
*  So I've noticed you really leaning [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=55.92s)]
*  into the multimodal part of this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  What makes it so special, these multimodal capabilities? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  What can you do now that you couldn't really do previously? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=64.4s)]
*  I mean, the world is multimodal. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=67.44s)]
*  So I think that's the most limited sense. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=69.12s)]
*  You can do a lot with text in and text out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=74.76s)]
*  But even just adding code, which a lot of people think [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=78.72s)]
*  is a modality, was huge. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Coding is one of the top use cases. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=82.34s)]
*  Image understanding and image generation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  has been very popular. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=88.16s)]
*  We've added that to the app. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=89.16s)]
*  But part of it is also just the, if you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  think about the kind of concepts, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=94.48s)]
*  when we learn concepts, we don't always learn them [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=96.0s)]
*  in a single modality. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=98.16s)]
*  And so if you think about what you can learn from a video, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=99.36s)]
*  or in a book, or code, it's a lot of times intelligence [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=102.72s)]
*  comes from mixing those modalities. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=106.8s)]
*  So it's not just being able to generate something [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=108.22s)]
*  in a modality. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=110.26s)]
*  But when you train the model, having it learn across [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=111.0s)]
*  modalities is quite powerful. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=114.56s)]
*  So that sounds all very cool and abstract. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=116.08s)]
*  But what's an example of how a business would use that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, most businesses [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=120.64s)]
*  have a lot of assets across various modalities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=124.0s)]
*  So imagine you're building a marketing campaign, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=126.64s)]
*  and you're doing sentiment analysis. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=129.44s)]
*  That's an area where you might want to reason about both [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=133.04s)]
*  your concrete images, or videos, or media [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=136.68s)]
*  in conjunction with text. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=141.72s)]
*  And so there are some use cases where it's almost [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=142.84s)]
*  kind of natively multimodal. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=146.56s)]
*  Or imagine you're a sports broadcaster, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=147.76s)]
*  and you've got a large video corpus. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=150.0s)]
*  And you say, hey, show me the most interesting part [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=151.72s)]
*  of this video, or show me when the quarterback, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=154.24s)]
*  I think there was a game when the quarterback throws [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=156.4s)]
*  a touchdown in the second inning. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=158.6s)]
*  That was yesterday, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=160.56s)]
*  Yeah, and which games were that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=161.72s)]
*  And then it can just say, oh, these were these three games. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=162.96s)]
*  So I think, yeah, exactly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=165.44s)]
*  That was too soon for those of us in San Francisco. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=166.76s)]
*  But there are a lot of those things. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=173.2s)]
*  I think years from now, if you think [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=176.6s)]
*  of just querying video with natural language, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=178.88s)]
*  that's something that's still actually really hard today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=182.24s)]
*  Queries of video have gotten a lot better. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=184.96s)]
*  There are a lot of people who use YouTube as a search engine, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=186.68s)]
*  for example. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=190.44s)]
*  But there's so much more we can do [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=191.24s)]
*  in terms of natural language interfaces to video [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=192.72s)]
*  that I think once we have it, we're [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=195.24s)]
*  going to wonder how we live without it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=196.88s)]
*  Right, can you give us even an example? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=200.28s)]
*  What are some early customers saying? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=202.12s)]
*  I know you've been testing this most powerful one [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=203.8s)]
*  with some business customers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=206.16s)]
*  What are some frequent use cases that you're seeing? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=207.52s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of the early uses now [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=211.56s)]
*  are trying to test the frontiers of the capability. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  So there are people who had use cases and didn't work, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=216.36s)]
*  like we're doing, for example, code generation [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=220.32s)]
*  and want the next level of performance, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=222.36s)]
*  or are pushing on advanced reasoning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=224.32s)]
*  There are various dimensions of the model [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=228.08s)]
*  that perform better as you scale it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=229.72s)]
*  And one of them is its reasoning capabilities. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=231.56s)]
*  And one of the other interesting areas [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=235.84s)]
*  where we see people apply the model is you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=237.56s)]
*  can use these models directly, prompt them, get some output. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=239.76s)]
*  But one of the most promising use cases for these models [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=242.4s)]
*  is actually using them as building blocks [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=244.68s)]
*  for other systems. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=246.52s)]
*  So if you think of something like AlphaCode, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=247.4s)]
*  AlphaCode is built with Gemini, but it's a whole system. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=249.28s)]
*  And briefly, AlphaCode is just a model just for code generation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=252.52s)]
*  Exactly, AlphaCode is a system we [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=257.08s)]
*  built for coding competitions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=258.6s)]
*  And so you can think of it as kind of like an AGI programmer. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=262.32000000000005s)]
*  And so you take a complex problem statement [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=265.68s)]
*  and then generate code to solve it, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=268.56s)]
*  specifically that kind of format of coding competition. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=271.48s)]
*  And using Gemini, AlphaCode was built using Gemini, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=274.16s)]
*  and it had major performance improvements. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=277.48s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a lot of systems, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  rather than just think about, hey, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=282.16s)]
*  what can you do with the model, kind of prompt in, prompt out, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  which is obviously interesting and compelling. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=285.72s)]
*  A lot of the interesting systems [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=288.32s)]
*  are going to just be systems that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  where they presume models like Gemini as a building block. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=291.2s)]
*  And then there's also a smaller version, a nano version. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=295.92s)]
*  What goes behind into the decision [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=299.96s)]
*  to make a really small version of this model? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=301.92s)]
*  What is it useful for? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=305.24s)]
*  There's roughly three high level sizes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=306.36s)]
*  So there's nano, which is for on device. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=309.28s)]
*  So think your phone, your laptop, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=311.8s)]
*  things where you're going to run the model on your device. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  Pro, which is the standard model, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=316.72s)]
*  which is a good balance for performance and capability. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=319.68s)]
*  So when you're using Bard or the developer API, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  the default model is quite good. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=325.36s)]
*  It's pro. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=327.16s)]
*  And then ultra is the highest performance model [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=327.68s)]
*  for when you need something that pushes those capabilities. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=330.48s)]
*  For nano, like I said, it's really motivated by on device. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=334.16s)]
*  So we've been doing AI on phones for quite a while. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  We see a lot of also opportunities [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=341.72s)]
*  on laptop and desktop computing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  And so a lot of platforms, we believe, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=345.68s)]
*  are going to have those models deployed [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=348.24s)]
*  as part of the platforms. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=350.0s)]
*  When you get your phone, you're going to have a model. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=350.8s)]
*  And so I don't know if you saw the circle list search work [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=353.2s)]
*  that we launched with Samsung. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=356.0s)]
*  That was powered by nano. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  We've done a lot of work with Pixel powered by nano. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=358.24s)]
*  And so it's just kind of like just similar [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=360.8s)]
*  to the previous point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=364.88s)]
*  It just becomes a building block when you have a platform [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=366.08s)]
*  that you start to use. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=368.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=369.72s)]
*  I mean, are you getting a sense yet what use cases [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=370.64s)]
*  you think will be enduring? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=375.52s)]
*  What use cases people will be willing to pay for years out [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=377.28s)]
*  from now? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=381.28s)]
*  And what may not be? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  What are you seeing that is just not up to the task right now? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=383.44s)]
*  Yeah, for Gemini specifically. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=386.64s)]
*  Yeah, just for generative AI. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=390.28s)]
*  I mean, it's still very early. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think that everyone is still kind of supply [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=392.52s)]
*  and capacity constrained. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=396.64s)]
*  So we're still at a point where I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=397.84s)]
*  think we're very much in the exploration phase in terms [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=400.52s)]
*  of figuring out what the frontier and what works [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=403.24s)]
*  and what doesn't. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=407.52s)]
*  I mean, coding is an example where [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=408.68s)]
*  you have an early adopter, software developers, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=410.6s)]
*  kind of easy use interface, a chatbot, and a free product. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=413.12s)]
*  And so it wasn't a surprise that coding kind of popped out [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=417.64s)]
*  as one of the main use cases because it's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=420.32s)]
*  a direct productivity boost. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=422.6s)]
*  The monthly subscription price is quite reasonable, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=424.52s)]
*  especially for people in that profession. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=427.24s)]
*  So coding will endure. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=429.24s)]
*  Yeah, coding for sure will endure. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, not just endure. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=431.76s)]
*  I think it will evolve. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=432.68s)]
*  Right now, if you look at how people are using coding, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  they're learning how to write code. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Think of like, well, coding is a big category. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=437.52s)]
*  So there are people who don't know [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  how to code who are using BARD to learn [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  how to code in the first place. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  There are other people who maybe don't know how to code [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=444.44s)]
*  but don't know how to, you know, a back end developer who [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=446.44s)]
*  doesn't know how to do front end development [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  and who is kind of doing something [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=450.64s)]
*  they wouldn't be able to do otherwise. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=452.12s)]
*  And then there are people who are, like I said, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=455.28s)]
*  what we're doing internally using the model as a building [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=460.84s)]
*  block to build an amazing coding system that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=463.12s)]
*  competes at an international level. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=465.44s)]
*  And coding competitions is kind of an extreme example. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=467.24s)]
*  And so I think that pattern of, I [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=469.56s)]
*  think we're going to see that kind of range of uses [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=471.76s)]
*  for coding, we're going to see that same pattern for other use [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  cases as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=477.84s)]
*  So I think coding will expand over time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  So you can imagine like porting, you know, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=480.44s)]
*  these are all relatively straightforward examples [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  where you're like, I have a coding description, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=485.08s)]
*  like a competition problem, and I generated a solution, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  which is, again, quite impressive that we're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=490.88s)]
*  exceeding human performance there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=493.36s)]
*  But you can imagine saying, like, hey, here's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  a 50-year-old COBOL code base, you know, port it to Java. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=496.88s)]
*  That was actually something we were [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=503.32000000000005s)]
*  talking about at the drinks. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=504.76s)]
*  So that's a very relevant example. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=506.0s)]
*  And then explain this part to me. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  I think there's a bug here. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  What is it? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=511.04s)]
*  If you think about what it would mean to have an intelligent [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=511.92s)]
*  encoding, again, we're just kind of scratching this, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=514.64s)]
*  you know, kind of these short prompts in, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  short generate code out. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=520.52s)]
*  We're really just scratching the surface for what [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=521.8s)]
*  you could do for coding. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=523.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=524.84s)]
*  I mean, are there any things that you [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=525.52s)]
*  thought were promising, but like, we're not quite there yet? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=526.6s)]
*  Like, we need a few more. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=529.52s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that still doesn't work. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=531.76s)]
*  If you think about BARD, we were integrated quite heavily [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=535.68s)]
*  in search, where we annotate the links with search output. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=540.16s)]
*  And it's really a change in paradigm. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  But we're still very much in this, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  when you think of the issue with hallucinations, for example, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=548.12s)]
*  we're not in a situation where you can just trust the model [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  output, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=553.6s)]
*  Like, where we're still grounding it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=554.28s)]
*  on public information on the web, or providing you links. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  You can almost think of it as like a research assistant. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=558.68s)]
*  So rather than you going out and saying, oh, hey, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=561.36s)]
*  I want to explore something. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=563.48s)]
*  I'm going to go a bunch of links, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=565.0s)]
*  open a bunch of tabs, and then synthesize it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  The model does that for you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=567.96s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I'm still [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=569.24s)]
*  going to want to know what the source's information is for. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=570.84s)]
*  And it might go there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=573.24s)]
*  And so it's more of like a change in the UX paradigm [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  for some of those. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  If you think of like travel planning, for example, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=578.36s)]
*  which is one of the ways I use it, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  it's more of a change in the user experience of travel [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=584.04s)]
*  planning. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=586.4s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I'm still [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=586.76s)]
*  interacting with the web. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=588.28s)]
*  It's now I've got an agent-centric user interface [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=589.36s)]
*  to it versus I'm the agent with a bunch of tabs [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=592.6s)]
*  clicking around. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=597.24s)]
*  You could imagine a world where you [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=598.64s)]
*  could do a complete travel experience where [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=600.2s)]
*  it does all the research. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=607.36s)]
*  You don't need the sources, books, flights for you. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=610.0s)]
*  Ask your feedback. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=612.44s)]
*  Proactively prompts you when your flight changes [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=614.12s)]
*  to rejigger things. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=616.84s)]
*  I mean, you can imagine just use travel planning as an example [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=617.72s)]
*  where we go beyond even well beyond where we are today. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=620.26s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=624.6400000000001s)]
*  I want to go back to something you said. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=625.32s)]
*  You said we're still supply constrained. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=627.12s)]
*  How does that influence the way you develop things like Gemini? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=629.12s)]
*  How do you think about costs? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=632.08s)]
*  And how do you think about chips? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=633.36s)]
*  It seems like it's not going away any time soon, right? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=636.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=640.32s)]
*  Sort of constraint. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=640.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=641.48s)]
*  We're just so early in the process. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=642.04s)]
*  I mean, we're just so early in the process [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=643.48s)]
*  in terms of figuring out where the technology works. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=646.76s)]
*  And I think it'll take, I don't think [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=649.16s)]
*  we'll be supply chain constrained forever. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=651.6s)]
*  It's just that I remember we were thinking [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=654.32s)]
*  through the transformer in BERT. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=658.84s)]
*  And I remember when I joined Google, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=660.76s)]
*  I was going on a bike ride with one of the infrastructure [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=662.1800000000001s)]
*  engineers who optimized transformers quite a bit [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=664.72s)]
*  to the point where now I think BERT's been mentioned by Sundar [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=667.76s)]
*  in our earnings calls two or three times. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=670.6800000000001s)]
*  And every time you type a search query, or many times, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  you're hitting a BERT model on the back end. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=676.32s)]
*  And so we took something that didn't exist, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=678.32s)]
*  was a research innovation. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=680.32s)]
*  And then we did a huge amount of infrastructure [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=682.36s)]
*  work to deploy that to multi-billion user products. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=684.32s)]
*  So better document understanding, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=687.4s)]
*  very query understanding. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=688.64s)]
*  And so this process of inventing a piece of research, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  figuring out how it could be applicable in a product context [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=694.36s)]
*  with all the various constraints that that has, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=697.16s)]
*  and then optimizing the infrastructure and scaling it, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=699.92s)]
*  that's a journey we've been on before. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  And so while the models are still [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=704.4s)]
*  quite expensive computationally to develop and run, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  this is the kind of problem we know how to solve. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=711.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=713.88s)]
*  How confident do you feel that you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=714.6s)]
*  can achieve the AI roadmap, given the current constraints? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=716.26s)]
*  In terms of our ability to build and deploy the models? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=721.34s)]
*  Given the constraints around chips, especially. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=724.78s)]
*  Oh, around the chips. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=726.78s)]
*  I mean, we definitely, we've done a ton of work [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=727.9s)]
*  to make our model development and training [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=734.06s)]
*  a lot more efficient. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=737.02s)]
*  So if you look at what we can train, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=737.98s)]
*  given the number of chips we have, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=740.38s)]
*  that's an area where we've been doing [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=741.78s)]
*  a ton of work in terms of efficiency. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=743.7s)]
*  And part of that is just because we want to constantly train. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=745.98s)]
*  There's so much progress in the research [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=748.82s)]
*  that you're constantly retraining because you're [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=750.7800000000001s)]
*  enabling new model techniques. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=753.22s)]
*  So Gemini, for example, Gemini Ultra [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=754.82s)]
*  is a far bigger model than the previous larger model we built, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=758.94s)]
*  but it's far cheaper to serve. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=762.1s)]
*  By what magnitude? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=763.5s)]
*  Or a multiple. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=764.6600000000001s)]
*  Single digits, but a multiple. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=766.4200000000001s)]
*  It's more performant by a multiple, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  but it's also cheaper to serve by a multiple. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=770.74s)]
*  And so it wasn't one breakthrough [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=772.74s)]
*  that led us to do that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=778.34s)]
*  It's just a bunch of sustained innovation [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=779.3s)]
*  in the model architecture improvements over years. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=780.9s)]
*  And so both in terms of sizing the compute [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=783.3s)]
*  to make sure that we can constantly build these models, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=789.58s)]
*  we figured that out. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=791.74s)]
*  We're still working on how to deploy them at scale. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=792.98s)]
*  But we've launched a lot of freely available products [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=796.5s)]
*  now that have, if you're a Google One subscriber, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=799.26s)]
*  you can go try Gemini Ultra yourself. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=803.54s)]
*  So we found a way to deploy them to a reasonable scale, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=805.62s)]
*  and we're going to keep increasing from there, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=811.22s)]
*  just like we did with BERT. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=813.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=814.18s)]
*  I think Sundar told me around October last year [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=814.68s)]
*  that if there's one thing that keeps them up at night, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=817.1s)]
*  it is the chip situation. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=819.34s)]
*  Does it keep you up at night, too? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=820.54s)]
*  It's certainly a constant. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=823.06s)]
*  I mean, we were in such a regime where humans were expensive [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=824.34s)]
*  and machines were cheap in the PC era. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=831.1s)]
*  And so it's interesting to go back to this world [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=833.82s)]
*  now where the machines are quite expensive. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say the humans are cheap, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=838.38s)]
*  but the machines are. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, just the sheer amount of compute that goes into these [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=843.0600000000001s)]
*  is pretty wild. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=846.14s)]
*  So it's not something that keeps me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=849.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're fortunate to. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=850.98s)]
*  We've developed our own chips in-house, the Tensor Processing [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=852.26s)]
*  Unit, for years, for generations. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=855.74s)]
*  We deploy it in our own data center. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=857.78s)]
*  So we have many fewer constraints in terms [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=859.54s)]
*  of we kind of own our pipeline of compute. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=862.9s)]
*  Are you leaning more into that over time [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=867.38s)]
*  versus GPUs and other sources? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=869.26s)]
*  I mean, we're leaning into both. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=870.9s)]
*  I think we're leaning into our own capacity [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=873.46s)]
*  quite heavily because we have a pretty insatiable appetite [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=875.98s)]
*  in terms of our products and then making them accessible. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=879.62s)]
*  But also, NVIDIA is a great partner of our Wee user chips [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=883.54s)]
*  internally for some of our workloads. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=886.14s)]
*  And then they're a key part of, I think, any kind of cloud [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=887.7s)]
*  platform. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=890.0600000000001s)]
*  So it's not for, you know, it's an and for us. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=891.0600000000001s)]
*  OK, I want to switch subjects very quickly. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=896.3s)]
*  So it's also almost a year since Google's two big AI teams, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=898.1s)]
*  Brain, which you were a part of, and DeepMind merged. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=904.94s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=910.3000000000001s)]
*  How is it going so far? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=911.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's Brain and DeepMind had really similar agendas [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=912.0600000000001s)]
*  in terms of the types of things that we wanted to achieve. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=916.58s)]
*  And so that really made things a lot easier. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=919.5400000000001s)]
*  There's alignment on the kind of other research aims [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=924.26s)]
*  and the product goals and whatnot. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=926.7800000000001s)]
*  And so that's really made so much of the things that would be. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=928.22s)]
*  There was no kind of big culture integration point. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=934.7s)]
*  We are always both part of Google. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=938.46s)]
*  And so there was kind of DNA, like people [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=939.98s)]
*  who would move between the two groups. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=942.5400000000001s)]
*  And so actually, the paper that kind of started [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=944.58s)]
*  this whole revolution was called a neural conversational model. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=949.98s)]
*  And this was pre-transformer, but it kind of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=953.9000000000001s)]
*  articulated this whole idea of using a deep neural network [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=957.22s)]
*  to build a chat bot. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=960.4200000000001s)]
*  And that was co-authored by Oril and Kwok, who [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=961.6600000000001s)]
*  were kind of senior researchers both at DeepMind and Brain, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=964.22s)]
*  who now sit on the same team. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=968.06s)]
*  And so it's kind of like in some of the areas, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=969.3s)]
*  we've actually brought back together people [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=971.6999999999999s)]
*  who collaborated a long time. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=973.38s)]
*  So that part's been great. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=976.02s)]
*  I mean, I would have to say I work quite a bit [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=978.02s)]
*  with people in London. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=980.42s)]
*  I definitely wake up earlier than I used to. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=981.3399999999999s)]
*  So there's that, but it's been pretty smooth. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=983.78s)]
*  So if both teams were working on sort of similar research [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  agendas, it seems to me like there [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=991.4599999999999s)]
*  would be a lot of overlap, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=993.3s)]
*  So how do you deal with that overlap? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=994.7399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess there was maybe duplication of work before. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=996.98s)]
*  So now are the teams just twice as big, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1000.58s)]
*  working on the same issues? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1003.02s)]
*  Or how do you allocate resources between these? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1004.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, that was part of the motivation, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1007.82s)]
*  is if you look at the amount of compute [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1009.66s)]
*  that we needed in the legacy of kind of Brain and DeepMind teams [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1013.5s)]
*  to achieve our objectives, it was eye-watering. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1016.0600000000001s)]
*  And we realized that if we joined forces, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1018.26s)]
*  we'd effectively be getting twice as much compute. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1022.0600000000001s)]
*  And so in the area that we work, that's a huge deal. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1024.74s)]
*  So that was definitely quite beneficial in terms [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  of being able to join forces. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1034.18s)]
*  The work is so dynamic that there are certain areas, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1037.3s)]
*  like generative media, where we had probably [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1039.7s)]
*  like five or six different teams building text image models, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1041.82s)]
*  but with different techniques. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1046.18s)]
*  And when those models were less computationally expensive [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1049.14s)]
*  to train, mostly because it was early [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1053.02s)]
*  and the quality wasn't as good, you [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1054.66s)]
*  could have five or six teams pursuing different approaches. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1056.06s)]
*  Now we're at the point where some of the models, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1059.06s)]
*  we have a pretty good understanding [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1061.7s)]
*  of how to build a high-quality model. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1063.3s)]
*  And so we've merged the teams, we've [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1064.58s)]
*  merged the compute budgets, and then we've basically [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1066.1s)]
*  kind of divided up the labor. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1069.46s)]
*  And some of the people have gone on to work on video [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1071.1s)]
*  instead of imagery. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1072.94s)]
*  So it's not that so much of the teams are twice as big. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1073.66s)]
*  It's just that we've taken four or five different models. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1075.9s)]
*  Now we're building one model, and some of the people [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1078.46s)]
*  are now working on video or music or other areas. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1080.66s)]
*  And so it hasn't been difficult to reapply. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1083.46s)]
*  There's so much to work on right now that it hasn't been. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1087.98s)]
*  Compute is definitely much more of a challenge [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1091.8600000000001s)]
*  than where to put people. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1093.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1094.74s)]
*  I think there was a moment after ChatGPT came out [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1095.5s)]
*  where people were wondering, well, where's Google? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1098.0600000000002s)]
*  And how did Google not put out something like this first? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1100.46s)]
*  And to some, Google looked slow. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1104.02s)]
*  What kind of an impact has the merger, do you think, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1106.14s)]
*  had on the speed of deploying things like a Gemini? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1108.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1113.22s)]
*  I mean, by design, the goal is to accelerate it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1113.7s)]
*  So we have a shared agenda. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1118.5400000000002s)]
*  We have a shared compute set of resources. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1120.18s)]
*  If you just look at it, we actually [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1126.0600000000002s)]
*  started Gemini before the merger as a joint. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1127.38s)]
*  That's actually why it was called Gemini. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1130.42s)]
*  How did that start? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1132.14s)]
*  How did the team start? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1133.22s)]
*  How did that start? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1134.62s)]
*  How did the decision to start Gemini? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1135.82s)]
*  I mean, we basically looked at we had this. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1139.34s)]
*  We both wanted to build the world's best multimodal [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1141.42s)]
*  foundation model. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1144.66s)]
*  And so that was kind of a natural. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1145.7s)]
*  DeepMind had a whole series of really great innovations, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1149.78s)]
*  like the chinchilla and the scaling laws [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1153.38s)]
*  and a set of models that they had built. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1155.1s)]
*  We, on the brain and Google research side, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1156.94s)]
*  most recently have been building Palm. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1160.94s)]
*  But when we looked at a lot of the architectural advances [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1163.18s)]
*  and investments were pretty complementary. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1166.0600000000002s)]
*  So we were using the chinchilla scaling laws quite heavily [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1167.74s)]
*  in building Palm. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1170.9s)]
*  And then a lot of the ideas for Palm [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1171.74s)]
*  became the basis for Gemini. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1173.42s)]
*  We both had multimodal LLMs in development as well, poly [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1176.38s)]
*  and flamingo, penguin, et cetera. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1182.5800000000002s)]
*  And so it was pretty natural to put those teams together. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1184.38s)]
*  And then we've executed. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1189.9s)]
*  It's been less than a year. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1192.62s)]
*  And we've already probably hundreds of launches [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1194.78s)]
*  that we've done in that time. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1200.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, Gemini was pretty much built in that time frame [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1201.62s)]
*  and shipped widely available. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1204.82s)]
*  So there's some areas where coordination [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1206.7399999999998s)]
*  will slow things down. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1212.82s)]
*  But there are other areas where the model training now [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1213.78s)]
*  follows the sun because we have both time zones. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1215.9399999999998s)]
*  So there's some things that have kind of sped up in ways [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1218.1799999999998s)]
*  that were unexpected. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1221.38s)]
*  Wait, I'm sorry. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1222.7s)]
*  Can you repeat that? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1223.14s)]
*  The model training follows the? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1223.68s)]
*  Well, we have people. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1224.94s)]
*  And we pretty much have people online all the time. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1225.9s)]
*  So if you have these large model training runs, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1228.2600000000002s)]
*  for most hours of the day, someone in the model team [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1233.0200000000002s)]
*  is working just because of the geographic distribution [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1235.22s)]
*  of the team. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1237.66s)]
*  And previously what? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1238.22s)]
*  You would be working in Mountain View. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1239.2600000000002s)]
*  And you would go to sleep. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1240.92s)]
*  And what would happen? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1242.0200000000002s)]
*  Well, you have a bug. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1244.14s)]
*  Someone would fix it in the morning. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1245.38s)]
*  There was just kind of the normal work [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1247.72s)]
*  rhythm of a single time zone. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1250.6200000000001s)]
*  Whereas now we're pretty much the sun [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1253.26s)]
*  never sets on Gemini development. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1256.7s)]
*  OK. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1259.3s)]
*  I know you're working on the next version of Gemini. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1262.6200000000001s)]
*  I think Sundar already said that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1264.74s)]
*  How far along are you in that process? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1266.5s)]
*  I can't share the specifics. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1268.66s)]
*  But we'll share more soon. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1269.8600000000001s)]
*  But yeah, we're very excited about what's in the pipeline. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1276.42s)]
*  What's your ambition for the next version of Gemini? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1279.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we laid out the kind [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1282.1000000000001s)]
*  of vision of a multimodal foundational model [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1284.6200000000001s)]
*  back in December when we launched Gemini V1. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1289.78s)]
*  And there are a lot of ways where you can just [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1292.46s)]
*  imagine better performance on the kind of dimensions [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1294.5800000000002s)]
*  that we outlined, like multimodal understanding [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1300.26s)]
*  and generation, all of the kind of various benchmarks. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1302.26s)]
*  And so that's obviously been one area of focus. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1304.78s)]
*  But the other is AGI is a big part of our mission. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1307.46s)]
*  And so if you think about memory and planning and reasoning [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1311.26s)]
*  and if you think about all of the capabilities, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  if these models are going to become part of systems that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1316.82s)]
*  are effectively intelligent agents, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1320.22s)]
*  then you can think of all of those capabilities [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1322.9s)]
*  that we'd start to need to develop as well, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1325.14s)]
*  not just being better across existing dimensions, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1328.66s)]
*  but getting the models to do new things. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1331.8600000000001s)]
*  So that's an area where we're pretty hard at work, too. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1333.7s)]
*  Right, and people talk about agents, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1337.5s)]
*  models that can take action on behalf of you. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1340.14s)]
*  Do we still need more technological work [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1342.9s)]
*  until we get there, or is it another question [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1346.26s)]
*  that we still haven't answered yet? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1350.54s)]
*  We see glimpses of that. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1352.46s)]
*  With BARD, we have something called extensions, which is, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1356.18s)]
*  well, now Gemini, in using tools. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1359.06s)]
*  And so we've gone from a world where it's just kind of a prompt [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1362.22s)]
*  input, model output, to now the model can, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1365.82s)]
*  Gemini can use tools on your behalf. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1368.54s)]
*  For example, it can use Google Flights or other services. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1370.1000000000001s)]
*  And so that's an early step. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1373.8600000000001s)]
*  And tool use is one of the components [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1376.34s)]
*  that you need for building an agent. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1380.18s)]
*  But if you think of memory and personalization [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1381.78s)]
*  and all of the attributes, you can [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1384.22s)]
*  start to see the early versions of those in Gemini. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1387.02s)]
*  And so that's an area where I don't [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1392.3s)]
*  think it's going to be a black or white moment, when [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1394.62s)]
*  all of a sudden an agent pops up and you're like, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1397.26s)]
*  you've woke up and you have a new coworker. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1400.7s)]
*  I think it's going to happen incrementally [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1403.18s)]
*  as the capabilities advance. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1405.26s)]
*  So we're still going to see some pretty dramatic improvements. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1406.86s)]
*  There'll be new types of tasks that the model can do [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1409.42s)]
*  that it couldn't do previously. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1412.1399999999999s)]
*  That will happen. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1414.34s)]
*  And I think will be some of the most exciting parts [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1417.06s)]
*  of these new models. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1419.58s)]
*  Do you think it'll be one universal agent or assistant [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1422.06s)]
*  in the workplace, for instance? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1425.5s)]
*  It resides on my desktop and it does all these different tasks [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1427.5s)]
*  across all these different dimensions? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1430.1s)]
*  Or will it be more specific and embedded, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1432.1399999999999s)]
*  or even industry specific? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1434.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's going to be both. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1435.98s)]
*  I mean, I think there's going to be both. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1437.54s)]
*  I think the technology is going to, like I said, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1439.4599999999998s)]
*  we're optimizing the technology and thinking [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1442.9s)]
*  through how to make it deployable. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1446.46s)]
*  And so it's going to just show up in more places [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1448.02s)]
*  as a building block. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1450.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you already see this in Gmail or Docs. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1452.3000000000002s)]
*  There's areas where now, you know, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1455.3400000000001s)]
*  Nano in your phone, which is areas where developers are [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1456.7800000000002s)]
*  going to start using this capability. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1459.0600000000002s)]
*  So like in the recorder app, like in the Pixel 8, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1460.7800000000002s)]
*  it can automatically summarize your recording. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1464.1000000000001s)]
*  You don't even think about it as that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1467.98s)]
*  Previously, a human would have done it. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1470.18s)]
*  If you rewind not that many decades ago, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1471.9s)]
*  that would have been something a human does. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1473.7800000000002s)]
*  And now, just in your pocket for free, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1475.7800000000002s)]
*  you have something that, like just using the Tensor chip [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1477.7s)]
*  in your phone, will summarize a two-hour long recording. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1479.9s)]
*  And we don't even think of that as an agent, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1483.74s)]
*  even though that would have been something that maybe [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1485.6200000000001s)]
*  would have, a human would have done before. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1488.5s)]
*  So I think there are a lot of areas like that, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1491.7s)]
*  where you're building out a marketing campaign, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1493.46s)]
*  or you're creating a new deck, and we're [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1495.74s)]
*  starting to generate images. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1497.4s)]
*  And you're like, oh, actually, I would have gone to a team [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1498.5400000000002s)]
*  to develop those images, and now Slides just did it for me. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1501.78s)]
*  So I think there are going to be ways where the technology just [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1504.98s)]
*  kind of incrementally appears and makes our products better. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1507.54s)]
*  But I think there are also going to be use cases where you do [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1510.02s)]
*  have a first-class agent that you're [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1512.82s)]
*  using to co-develop an idea where it's more [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1516.74s)]
*  of an explicit part of the user interface, where you're [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1519.46s)]
*  asking a question, or it's proactively prompting you. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1522.1s)]
*  And like travel, for example, might [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1524.86s)]
*  be a good example where you're working with a Gemini app [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1526.46s)]
*  to travel and to travel plan something. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1529.18s)]
*  That's just kind of an emergent capability [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1531.74s)]
*  that Gemini will do for you. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1537.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1539.3s)]
*  I have one more question, so people [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1540.1s)]
*  want to think about audience questions. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1541.78s)]
*  What about search? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1545.1s)]
*  You just rolled out Gemini in the Google app on your iPhone. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1546.46s)]
*  You can toggle right between search and Gemini, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1550.14s)]
*  which to me seems like something pretty new for Google, which [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1553.5s)]
*  is so closely associated with search. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1557.14s)]
*  Do you think people will be using models like Gemini, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1561.58s)]
*  much like they use search today? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1564.02s)]
*  And this is part of why there are two different product [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1570.62s)]
*  experiences, is that they do do different things. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1573.26s)]
*  So if you look at, for example, people using Gemini [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1576.74s)]
*  for software development, we had a lot of people [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1579.7s)]
*  with coding use cases on search. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1583.62s)]
*  But people weren't going to learn about coding [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1585.5s)]
*  and whatnot, but we didn't see search [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1590.86s)]
*  as a place where people were going to write code. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1592.4199999999998s)]
*  And that's definitely something we see in Gemini [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1593.9799999999998s)]
*  or writing emails. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1596.1399999999999s)]
*  So I think there are a lot of use cases that are new. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1597.02s)]
*  And obviously, the product form factor is different. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1599.74s)]
*  It's a conversational user interface. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1602.4199999999998s)]
*  But I think there's a lot. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1606.3s)]
*  On the flip side, we have a very long tradition [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1607.9399999999998s)]
*  of putting new LLM technology into search. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1610.06s)]
*  And I use the BERT example, where now we [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1612.54s)]
*  don't even think about better document [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1615.1399999999999s)]
*  understanding, better query understanding. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1617.26s)]
*  And SGE, or Search Generative Experience, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1618.74s)]
*  is just the evolution of that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1620.7s)]
*  It's like, we'll put Gemini in search. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1622.46s)]
*  Search Generative Experience for the people. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1624.14s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, which is putting Gemini in search. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1625.86s)]
*  And there are a lot of places where we'll do that now. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1628.86s)]
*  And because the technology is expensive to deploy, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1631.18s)]
*  it's kind of like as BERT was originally. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1636.54s)]
*  We could only do it in some places. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1638.54s)]
*  But again, as we deploy it more widely, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1640.06s)]
*  as we get scale benefits from having deployed it [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1641.98s)]
*  over so many services, the unit costs come down, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1644.94s)]
*  I think there are a lot of places where it'll just, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1648.9s)]
*  in the previous example of the product, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1652.22s)]
*  we'll just get better in a lot of these ways. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1654.06s)]
*  And we'll just think of it as search. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1655.9s)]
*  But search has evolved quite a bit over the last 10 to 15 [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1657.54s)]
*  years. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1660.46s)]
*  But it's just evolved incrementally in place. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1660.7s)]
*  And so I think we'll continue to evolve and innovate [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1663.42s)]
*  in that kind of product form factor [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1668.66s)]
*  while we push on the Gemini app, which is a pretty different [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1670.46s)]
*  product form factor. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1674.54s)]
*  And they might sit side by side like they do in the app today. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1675.34s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1677.62s)]
*  Cool. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1679.86s)]
*  I want to take it to the audience. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1680.22s)]
*  Yes, this gentleman. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1681.5s)]
*  Larry, it's Patrick, OneMain Financial. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1688.5s)]
*  I'm really interested in the aspect of reasoning [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1690.98s)]
*  in large language models. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1694.18s)]
*  Today, getting reasoning out of large language models [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1696.42s)]
*  is a bit of a contortion with various prompting strategies, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1699.74s)]
*  chain of thought, tree of thought, et cetera. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1703.98s)]
*  And then MetaCicero program married a separate strategy [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1706.18s)]
*  engine with a language model to create [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1711.26s)]
*  a game that played diplomacy at a pretty high level, right? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1713.9s)]
*  So I want to ask about your forecast. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1716.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you think language models in generative AI [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1718.26s)]
*  will learn reasoning? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1720.22s)]
*  Or do you think that's a separate endeavor that [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1721.3s)]
*  needs to be married together with these language models? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1723.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1725.46s)]
*  I mean, to some extent, some of your examples [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1726.74s)]
*  like chain of thought and tree of thought, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1728.74s)]
*  I would say are examples where the model is learning reasoning. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1731.14s)]
*  But to your point, I think a lot of the most advanced systems [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1736.3000000000002s)]
*  will be the coupling of a model plus a separate system. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1739.94s)]
*  And so alpha fold and alpha code being [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1744.74s)]
*  good examples of that, where we take a model as a building [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1746.46s)]
*  block to solve more domain-specific problems. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1748.98s)]
*  So I do think we'll see progress on reasoning [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1752.26s)]
*  just because that is something that we [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1755.5800000000002s)]
*  would expect to get better, not just in terms [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1757.7s)]
*  of the prompting strategies and being better able to pull [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1761.66s)]
*  that performance out of the model, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1765.42s)]
*  but also as a native capability, that [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1766.82s)]
*  is something that gets better as the models scale up. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1768.5800000000002s)]
*  But I think a lot of the biggest advances [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1772.3s)]
*  are also going to be domain-specific in that way [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1778.98s)]
*  that we apply a model to playing a game, for example, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1781.18s)]
*  or a coding competition. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1785.5800000000002s)]
*  In those environments, you can get really powerful things [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1787.42s)]
*  when you combine a model plus a discrete system. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1790.5s)]
*  But yeah, I do think we're going to see the model. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1793.66s)]
*  Actually, if you use Gemini Ultra, like on the Gemini app, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1796.22s)]
*  the reasoning is pretty wild. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1798.8600000000001s)]
*  We're already quite good at a number. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1800.6200000000001s)]
*  It beats me at a number of problems. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1803.98s)]
*  So it's an area where we've made a lot of progress [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1806.66s)]
*  in the last two years. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1810.38s)]
*  We collectively, researchers in this area. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1813.02s)]
*  I think we might have time for one more question. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1816.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1818.78s)]
*  Here. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1819.28s)]
*  Hi, I'm Tetsuji. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1827.38s)]
*  Coming from Tokyo, Japan, working for Nippon USEN. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1829.06s)]
*  Very, very simple question. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1831.66s)]
*  Assuming that GPT-4 has a benchmark, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1833.7s)]
*  what's the difference between GPT-4 and Gemini? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1838.98s)]
*  Yeah, so like I said, Gemini is available in three sizes. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1848.3s)]
*  So Ultra is the largest, most capable model, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1851.82s)]
*  which you can think of as being a GPT-4 class model. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1854.8600000000001s)]
*  So in 30 of 32 of the benchmarks, we're ahead. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1859.06s)]
*  But let's take Gemini Pro. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1863.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1865.74s)]
*  For example, GPT-4. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1866.24s)]
*  Yeah, so Gemini Pro is a smaller, more efficient, more [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1868.38s)]
*  model. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1874.42s)]
*  So depending on the product application [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1874.92s)]
*  you would use in the deployment factor, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1876.9s)]
*  you would use Nano versus Ultra. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1879.74s)]
*  So if you wanted the most capable highest end [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1882.18s)]
*  model for complex tasks, that would [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1886.46s)]
*  be Ultra, which would be likely what you're using GPT-4 for. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1888.2600000000002s)]
*  Which period, in which point, you are superior to GPT-4? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1898.38s)]
*  Yeah, so if you go to the Gemini website, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1909.14s)]
*  we kind of break down a set of academic benchmarks. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1912.14s)]
*  And you can see, you can kind of dig into the benchmarks [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1914.7s)]
*  and look at natural language understanding and reasoning [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1917.6200000000001s)]
*  in the various kind of scores. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1921.14s)]
*  In those benchmarks, there are also external benchmarks [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1924.0600000000002s)]
*  where people put the models through their paces in a chat [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1927.44s)]
*  bot competition context. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1931.4s)]
*  But it's effectively better performance [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1933.3600000000001s)]
*  on the kind of core capabilities that you [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1935.16s)]
*  see in those benchmarks. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1937.16s)]
*  Is there any feedback you're getting from customers [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1941.96s)]
*  who specifically are testing it versus GPT-4? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1944.28s)]
*  Yeah, the fun part about making Gemini Ultra accessible [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1947.48s)]
*  through the app is I now get all these side [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1952.16s)]
*  by sides of GPT-4 and Ultra. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1953.96s)]
*  And we see a lot about the areas where [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1958.28s)]
*  people find Gemini better. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1961.48s)]
*  I also see ones where GPT-4 is better. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1963.32s)]
*  And so we look at those and learn a lot from them. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1965.68s)]
*  Are there any themes emerging? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1968.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of some of the top-level themes. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1971.3600000000001s)]
*  I think reasoning is an area where Gemini Ultra is [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1976.68s)]
*  consistently better. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1980.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think there's some areas where, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1983.44s)]
*  because the model's only been out, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1986.04s)]
*  we've only been hourly checking on human feedback for less time [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1987.4s)]
*  where it's worse. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1990.44s)]
*  So it's probably not at a steady state yet. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvz9NRexCPE&t=1991.3200000000002s)]
