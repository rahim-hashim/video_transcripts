# FTC Chair Lina Khan on the Role of the Government, Trade and Antitrust | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg)
*  In Washington, the Washington Post had a really interesting piece just this week about you, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=0.0s)]
*  a giant profile, and my friend Steve Pearlstein wrote this, Lena Kahn, the crusading chair [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=4.72s)]
*  of the Federal Trade Commission who at the age of 35 has become the wonky cult hero and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=12.44s)]
*  legal wonder kind of a new progressive movement determined to break the economic and political [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=17.8s)]
*  power of big business and big tech. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  It's a lot to digest in that, but cult hero is kind of an interesting description, right? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=26.12s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just say it's so great to be here and, you know, it's such [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=33.04s)]
*  an honor to be in this role, especially at such a unique moment in our economy and in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=36.76s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=42.8s)]
*  You know, the big tech part of that description is where I wanted to start with you, if I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=44.2s)]
*  could. You know, you've talked a lot about the concentrated power of big tech and the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=48.24s)]
*  dangers of concentrated power in big tech, and you said something provocative that caught [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=53.88s)]
*  my eye about the way big tech is impacting the world of journalism, where I've lived [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  At the Digital Context Next Summit recently, you said, historically, we've seen how it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=65.56s)]
*  was really important for policymakers to play an active role in structuring markets to make [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=71.12s)]
*  sure that an independent free press remains viable. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=76.16s)]
*  Is big tech making an independent free press unviable? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=80.94s)]
*  And if so, what can the FTC do about that? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  So there's no doubt that over the last couple of decades, we've seen enormous dislocations [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=89.34s)]
*  across sectors, but perhaps no where more than in journalism because of the rise of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=94.98s)]
*  these digital platforms. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=99.9s)]
*  And there were a couple of aspects of that that were quite significant. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  One was we went from a regime where if you wanted to advertise on the Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=104.78s)]
*  if you wanted to reach Wall Street Journal readers, you had to place an ad on the Wall [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=110.06s)]
*  Street Journal to a regime instead where you now have these dominant middlemen that are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=113.14s)]
*  tracking people across the internet, across devices, and that's created a very different [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=118.62s)]
*  regime that has had, I think, significant ramifications for people's privacy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=124.54s)]
*  We've also saw a lot of consolidation of power and concentration of power. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=130.14s)]
*  The Justice Department right now has a lawsuit against Google for basically making a whole [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=135.66s)]
*  set of acquisitions that they allege have now monopolized the digital ad tech suite [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=141.26s)]
*  in ways that is now really harming publishers and advertisers alike. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=147.58s)]
*  And so overall, we've seen the rise of dominant middlemen and dominant intermediaries that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=153.02s)]
*  a lot of times are taking a bigger and bigger cut at the expense of both the producers and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=159.22s)]
*  the consumers. And that's a trend that we see in journalism, but in all sorts of other [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=165.46s)]
*  contexts. And does the rise of AI make that problem [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=169.58s)]
*  inevitably bigger and more complicated? I mean, I note, for example, that Scarlett Johansson [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  just this week said, Chet GPT asked for permission to mimic my voice. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  I didn't give it. They seem to have done it anyway. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=184.38s)]
*  What is the danger to content producers and their revenue stream from the AI introduction [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  into this space? So we see across the board wholesale scraping [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=196.66s)]
*  of people's content. The FTC a couple of months ago held a roundtable with creators, with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  voice artists, with graphic designers who all shared that they woke up one day and felt [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=209.42s)]
*  that their life's work had been gobbled up by these models. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=215.34s)]
*  Nobody had asked them. They were not getting paid for it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  And all of a sudden, some of these models were now spitting back out their own content [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=223.10000000000002s)]
*  in competition with them. And so we see huge potential devaluation of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=228.5s)]
*  the content that people have created. And I think there are interesting competition [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=233.94s)]
*  implications as well. And so in some ways, that's just a continuation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  of what we've seen. In some ways, it's different. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=242.1s)]
*  I think we're also seeing the possibility that the web is going to become much more [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=245.38s)]
*  closed rather than open. And I think that's a risk that we need to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=249.7s)]
*  be vigilant about as well. It's interesting. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=253.7s)]
*  I did an experiment this morning. I wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=256.1s)]
*  for like 29 years. And I assume that's all been consumed by [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  AI now. And I went on Chet GPT and said, write a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=264.1s)]
*  Gerald F. Seib column. And it instantly spit out about 700 words [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=267.38s)]
*  of pretty vapid. And maybe that should tell me something. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=270.86s)]
*  But plausible copy. So what rights that I have have been violated [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=273.94s)]
*  in that process? So from a law enforcement matter, you'd [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=281.26s)]
*  want to look at this in a very fact-specific way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=285.3s)]
*  There's no doubt that, you know, especially in contexts where people have shared their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=289.5s)]
*  with certain companies and have not signed off on that data being used to train the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=295.9s)]
*  models. And so in some instances, we're seeing now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  retroactive changes to terms of service or policies saying, now we're going to retroactively [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=304.26s)]
*  say we can use all of your data, be it the photos you loaded from family vacations, the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=311.14s)]
*  videos of your kids. All of that is now fair game to be fed into [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=317.41999999999996s)]
*  our models. And I think that's where people feel a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=321.98s)]
*  sense of violation that that's not really what they signed up for. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=324.98s)]
*  And oftentimes they feel that they don't have recourse. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=328.66s)]
*  Some of these services are essential for navigating day-to-day life. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=331.9s)]
*  And so if the choice you're being presented with is, you know, sign off on not just being [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=336.22s)]
*  endlessly surveilled but all of that data being fed into these models or forego using these [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=341.94s)]
*  services entirely, I think that's a really tough spot to put people in. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=347.26s)]
*  The question that arises is, what can you do about it if that's the problem? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=351.42s)]
*  And you made a speech recently on AI in which you said our remedies, our meaning the FTC's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=356.26s)]
*  remedies, will continue requiring that firms delete models trained on unlawfully acquired [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=361.98s)]
*  data in addition to the data itself. So how do you do that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=368.7s)]
*  And what are the tools that you actually have at your disposal? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=372.5s)]
*  Because this is a very unconventional problem. So let me just say to step back, I think in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=375.38s)]
*  Washington there's increasingly a recognition that we can't as a government just be totally [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=381.5s)]
*  hands off and stand out of the way. I think that was the philosophy that we saw [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=387.5s)]
*  in place during Web 2.0. And that's had some pretty devastating dating ramifications in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  terms of people's privacy, in terms of the state of the independent press. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=397.74s)]
*  And so there is a desire to learn from that experience. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  You're right that in some ways this is going to look different. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  But we have to make sure we're marshaling the lessons of the past, both in the privacy [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=409.74s)]
*  space, but also the antitrust and competition space. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=414.06s)]
*  There's no inevitable outcome here. And we as policymakers and as a society can help [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=418.02s)]
*  make decisions and choices that are going to steer these technologies on a path that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=423.3s)]
*  actually serves us rather than a model where a handful of companies are just extracting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=428.14s)]
*  more and more from society, from creators, and people feel they don't have recourse. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=434.02s)]
*  At the FTC, we enforce both the antitrust and consumer protection laws. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=440.14s)]
*  We've been very active on both fronts. And I would say on the antitrust side, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=444.94s)]
*  we are scrutinizing the entire stack from the chips to the compute and cloud to the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=449.82s)]
*  models to the apps, trying to understand what are the kind of key properties of each of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=455.58s)]
*  these layers in layers where you are already seeing some bottlenecks or a handful of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=460.42s)]
*  companies controlling that stack. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=466.14s)]
*  How do we make sure that's not being used in anti-competitive ways such that innovators [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  and entrepreneurs are going to be locked out? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=474.38s)]
*  I went to Silicon Valley a few months ago and I heard a tremendous amount of excitement [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=476.7s)]
*  from a lot of founders and startups, especially about the potential of open source, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=481.14s)]
*  which has historically been a key driver of innovation. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=486.06s)]
*  But there was also some apprehension in part because there was a recognition that right [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=489.26s)]
*  now the raw material for a lot of these tools is in the hands of a very small number of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=494.22s)]
*  companies. And so who's even getting access to the models? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=500.26s)]
*  Who is getting access to compute and on what terms? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=504.26s)]
*  All of that seems very opaque to a lot of the founders and startups. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=507.7s)]
*  And I think there's a concern that especially if you have vertical integration and conflicts [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=511.66s)]
*  of interest, there could be self-dealing, there could be discrimination, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=516.94s)]
*  there could be exclusion so that the big guys are just getting bigger at the expense of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=521.46s)]
*  everybody. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=526.58s)]
*  Well, is that the logical, maybe inevitable outcome of this process that the big players [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=526.94s)]
*  who are big now become the big players in the AI space inevitably? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=532.5400000000001s)]
*  Or is there a path where that's not the case? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=536.94s)]
*  I think this is where you need to look at each layer of the stack. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=540.74s)]
*  And so, for example, we see significant consolidation in the cloud computing space. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  You basically have three major players there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=548.98s)]
*  Right now we see significant consolidation in the chips layer as well. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=551.78s)]
*  And we need to understand is there a path for injecting more competition into these layers? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  At the very least, we need to make sure that these firms are not using any monopoly power or [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=562.58s)]
*  market power that they may have to entrench that dominance or to exclude competitors. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=567.58s)]
*  Historically, we've also used another set of tools when we've dealt with markets where you see a lot of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=573.86s)]
*  consolidation. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=580.34s)]
*  And so, be it the railroads, be it telecom, we've had certain tools in place where we've recognized, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=581.58s)]
*  okay, there's going to be a certain degree of economies of scale here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=588.26s)]
*  And what we need to make sure is that power is not being abused. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=592.54s)]
*  And so, we've had things like non-discrimination rules that said you have to treat everybody on equal [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=596.5s)]
*  terms when they're asking for service. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=602.22s)]
*  We've had things like structural separation rules that said if you own the rails, you can't also then go [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=604.74s)]
*  own the coal mines because then you're obviously just going to transport your own coal and leave everybody else. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=611.5400000000001s)]
*  We've had mandated interoperability rules that have tried to inject more competition. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=617.94s)]
*  So, I think we need to be thinking expansively. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=622.86s)]
*  Antitrust and competition tools are critical. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  But we need to potentially also be drawing on this broader set of tools if what we're dealing with in some of these [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=629.06s)]
*  layers is just huge economies of scale, huge fixed costs, major barriers to entry that do risk entrenching the power [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=635.3s)]
*  of the existing first. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=644.9399999999999s)]
*  But it seems complicated because, for example, the FTC's job is not to enforce intellectual copyright rights. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  If you don't have that legal power in your toolkit, what do you resort to? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=655.1s)]
*  What legal powers do you have? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=659.62s)]
*  So, the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=662.1800000000001s)]
*  And so, you can imagine if somebody's content or information is being scraped that they have produced and then is being [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=668.82s)]
*  used in ways to compete with them and to dislodge them from the market and divert businesses, in some cases, that could be [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=677.78s)]
*  an unfair method of competition. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=687.5s)]
*  I think we've also seen a lot of concern about deception, about unfairness. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  If firms are making one set of representations when you're signing up to use them, but then are secretly or quietly using the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  data you're feeding them, be it your personal data, be it if you're a business, the proprietary data, your competitively significant data, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=701.78s)]
*  if they're then using that to feed their models, to compete with you, to abuse your privacy, that can also raise legal concerns. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=709.4599999999999s)]
*  But you're absolutely right that the FTC is just one agency out of many government players that have an important role to play here. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=717.62s)]
*  You know, the classic problem in this kind of space is for a regulator, the desire to make sure there aren't abuses, but at the same time to recognize that [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=725.06s)]
*  there's a whole new technology here that has enormous economic benefit for the country, frankly, and that is already being recognized as such. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=736.62s)]
*  So, how do you stop the abuses without squelching the innovation and the creativity that AI can produce in the economy, broadly speaking? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=744.42s)]
*  That's such an important point. And for me, our history as a country is really relevant here, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=752.98s)]
*  Because if you look at some of the last set of major technological inflection points, be it the telecommunications revolution, be it the internet revolution, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=759.02s)]
*  we as a country applied a certain set of principles which said we need to have markets that allow the best ideas to win, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=769.1s)]
*  especially when those ideas are introducing breakthrough innovations that are going to deliver enormous prosperity, enormous growth. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=777.86s)]
*  What we need to make sure is that the existing firms that might feel threatened by some of these newcomers are not in a position to squash them out of the market in the first place. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=786.7s)]
*  And so the government's actions against IBM and AT&T, you know, in the last century, even the government's case against Microsoft, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=797.66s)]
*  ended up being really important interventions to make sure at the very least the existing monopolists are not able to trample on any newcomers and any new innovations that could deliver a lot of those benefits. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=806.58s)]
*  And so I think we need to be very wary of some of the national champion arguments that you hear saying you have to let the big guys stay ahead. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  You need to let them squash the competition. You need to shut out open source from the market because that's the only way we're going to win on the global stage. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=829.58s)]
*  I think historically those arguments have not served us well when we've doubled down on national champions and locked out competitors. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=839.0600000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's something we need to be extremely vigilant about this time around, too. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=846.6600000000001s)]
*  I want to leave some time for audience questions at the end. So let me just ask you about a couple of other items before before we move on. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=851.0600000000001s)]
*  You've you've spent a lot of time, a lot of the agency's energy working on non compete clauses. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=857.22s)]
*  Why is that such a high priority item for you? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=867.38s)]
*  And what is the early rounds tell you about the legal prospects for doing what you're trying to do in that space? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=869.86s)]
*  So this work preceded my arrival at the agency. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=877.14s)]
*  We had had certain workshops and tried to understand how prevalent are non competes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=879.62s)]
*  Right. These are closets that started off in the boardroom, but over the last couple of decades have really proliferated across the economy, across sectors, across income level. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=884.62s)]
*  So we're talking fast food workers, security guards, janitors, as well as your senior executives, scientists, doctors. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=895.1800000000001s)]
*  So we proposed a rule based on a lot of empirical evidence that has shown that non competes suppress wages. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=903.3000000000001s)]
*  Interestingly, not just for the workers that are covered by a non compete, but also for workers who aren't. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  Because if you have less churn in the economy, if you have people who are not as efficiently able to match with employers and are instead trapped, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=916.9s)]
*  that's going to be bad for workers as a whole because there's just less opportunity. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=925.38s)]
*  We've also seen evidence, empirical work showing that this is harmful to competition. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=930.14s)]
*  The FTC has heard from businesses, from entrepreneurs about how non competes impeded people's ability to either go launch their own business. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=935.9s)]
*  We actually got a lot of comments from people who said, you know, I work for an employer that candidly is not doing a great job. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=945.26s)]
*  I have ideas for how I could deliver a better product at a better price, but I'm not able to go launch my own business because of a non compete. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=951.6999999999999s)]
*  We heard from a lot of entrepreneurs about how non competes had limited their ability to scale up because the relevant talent pool was locked up. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=959.9s)]
*  Interestingly, a lot of this empirical data came from states that have restricted non compete. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=970.78s)]
*  So California for over a century has said non compete are non enforceable. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=977.74s)]
*  We've also seen states like Oklahoma, North Dakota really curb non competes and a whole set of other states in the last decade. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=982.9s)]
*  And so that created a natural experiment where researchers were able to isolate what are the effects of non competes and then produce all of this evidence and all of this research showing it's having a detrimental effect for labor markets, but also critically for product and service markets. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  We're losing out on new business formation. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1008.1s)]
*  We're losing out on new innovation. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1010.34s)]
*  And so we were really pleased to be able to put forward this role. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1012.5s)]
*  Let me let me ask you finally just to talk a little more broadly about your philosophy here, because, you know, at the outset, I quoted my friend Steve as saying you're a cult hero. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1016.02s)]
*  One place you're probably not a cult hero is in C suites and executive boardrooms. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1024.3s)]
*  And some of your critics would say you don't really believe in free markets for the capitalist system. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1030.38s)]
*  Clinton and Obama adviser Lawrence Summers, for example, has been quoted as saying the Biden administration's policies amount to, quote, almost like a war on business. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1035.26s)]
*  Is it a war on business? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1044.54s)]
*  Look, competition and free and fair competition is an essential ingredient to have free markets and a capitalist system that works, because what you want is for new ideas and entrepreneurs to have a fair shot in the market and to be able to compete on the merits of their ideas. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1046.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, that's really has been essential for America's prosperity, for the innovations that our country has delivered and a system instead where you have really a lot of concentrated control, basically a closed and centralized system. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1065.1399999999999s)]
*  That's not the recipe for success in America. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1081.5s)]
*  And so making sure we're enforcing our antitrust laws, having open, fair, honest and competitive markets is so essential, and it's absolutely critical for entrepreneurs and startups. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1085.06s)]
*  I mean, we hear a lot from businesses, including from executives at businesses, including some big businesses who say, you know, I'm trying to compete on the merits. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1096.9799999999998s)]
*  But here I am having to go through this gatekeeper that overnight can change the algorithm and all of a sudden I have disappeared from the Internet. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1107.02s)]
*  I mean, that type of consolidation of power and the arbitrariness that comes with it, I think is really hostile to a free enterprise system. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1115.26s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to push back against. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1123.78s)]
*  Let me see if there are questions here. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1126.94s)]
*  I'll start on the aisle there and wait for a microphone. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1128.9s)]
*  And I would just remind people that a question actually has a question mark at the end of it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1131.5s)]
*  Hi, good morning. Chris Burns with the Second City. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1138.02s)]
*  As an arts organization, this topic of learning models, learning off of artistic works is really interesting to us. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1141.7s)]
*  And so I'm interested to get your perspective. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1151.86s)]
*  Many would argue that the creative process draws inspiration from things that they see and experience. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1155.02s)]
*  And that copyright infringement occurs at production, not at inspiration. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1162.4199999999998s)]
*  But if we change it to where the models are being prohibited from learning from other artistic words, are we changing the where the copyright gets enforced? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1167.82s)]
*  So it's a really interesting question. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1179.1799999999998s)]
*  And I know there are copyright experts, including at the Copyright Office, that are thinking about some of those intricacies and what is copyright look like in an A.I. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1180.7s)]
*  world. For us at the FTC, I mean, what we've heard primarily from artists is a they're excited about A.I. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1189.74s)]
*  They see that there are opportunities here. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1197.3000000000002s)]
*  What they are really worried about is a regime where their productions, their content is being taken and lifted without any permission being asked, without any consent, without any compensation and with very little recourse. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1199.9s)]
*  I mean, once your creations have been fed into these models, it's actually pretty difficult to unlearn in a model. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1215.9s)]
*  And so I think making sure we have the right regime in place on the front end. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1223.26s)]
*  I know various publishers have been entering into agreements and, you know, making sure that there is that consent and compensation on the front end. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1228.02s)]
*  I think that's going to be an important regime. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1237.22s)]
*  I would defer to copyright experts on some of those intricacies, but making sure that we're not in a, you know, move fast, break things, ask questions later type mode here is going to be important. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1239.74s)]
*  We'll go there and then over here. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1252.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1255.42s)]
*  Wayne Hepler, I'm a college professor from Baltimore. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1263.22s)]
*  Thank you for coming here. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1266.18s)]
*  I know you do a lot of interviews and answer the same questions over and over. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1267.22s)]
*  Thank you for coming. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1270.46s)]
*  Thank you for being a very popular topic in my college classroom. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1271.98s)]
*  I appreciate that. And my question. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1276.3400000000001s)]
*  We've heard a lot about possibility of overreach on the FTC today. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1279.22s)]
*  I'm sure it's not a new topic to you. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1282.66s)]
*  I'm curious what the nature of discussion was on that topic between you and President Biden when he appointed you. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1284.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1291.5s)]
*  That's an easy one. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1294.22s)]
*  So it's such an honor to be in this position. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1298.38s)]
*  And, you know, the president has really been transformative on economic policy and the executive order that he signed in 2021 said pretty clearly that for the last 40 years we've been enforcing the antitrust laws and competition policy in a way that has taken us astray. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1300.82s)]
*  And we've seen so much more consolidation. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1317.86s)]
*  And this has been bad. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1319.94s)]
*  And we need to really focus on reinvigorating our anti-monopoly and antitrust laws. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1321.46s)]
*  He charged the FTC and DOJ with that. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1326.9s)]
*  But he also charged other agencies across government via the Department of Transportation the Department of Agriculture Health and Human Services. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1329.7800000000002s)]
*  And so we see right now a whole of government effort to make sure the economy is open fair competitive and that it's serving actual the American people rather than, you know, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1338.7800000000002s)]
*  a handful of monopolists. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1349.94s)]
*  And so, you know, that's the vision that's animating a lot of the administration's work on economics. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1351.14s)]
*  Okay. The clock says zero. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1356.8600000000001s)]
*  But I'm in charge. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1357.8600000000001s)]
*  One more briefly. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1359.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm in charge. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1362.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1363.8600000000001s)]
*  I think the Sherman Antitrust Act was 1890. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1366.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1369.8200000000002s)]
*  We are obviously well past 1890. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1370.7800000000002s)]
*  Is there any thought to significantly revamping and rethinking the legislative approach to this to modernize it and make it more adept at dealing with the very different challenges that we're facing in the 21st century? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1373.54s)]
*  So there are a set of lawmakers that are thinking about that very question. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1388.8999999999999s)]
*  At the FTC, we are focused on enforcing the existing laws. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1392.98s)]
*  But when we see that there are gaps, you know, it's important to me that we're telling Congress about that to inform their approach. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1397.02s)]
*  I think as we're seeing, you know, these new AI tools hit the market, that's again catalyzing a lot of thinking about how do we make sure the laws we have in place are fit for purpose in the 21st century? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1404.6200000000001s)]
*  I would just add good luck getting a complicated piece of legislation through Congress. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1416.26s)]
*  Then you will you will be a cult hero if you do that. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg&t=1421.78s)]
