**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I)
*  You're making this big bet on the future of fossil fuels at a time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=0.0s)]
*  when the world is moving away, pressure is mounting on companies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=4.16s)]
*  to move away from fossil fuels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=7.88s)]
*  How does your strategy make sense? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, I want to thank you and thanks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=14.02s)]
*  to the journal for inviting me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=16.16s)]
*  I'm a long time subscriber and a big fan of the work [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=17.88s)]
*  of you and your colleagues. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=20.84s)]
*  So, look, one of the big challenges for an energy company [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  like ours is we've got a big business today [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=27.4s)]
*  that meets the needs of the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  And we've got customers and economies around the world [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=32.2s)]
*  that depend on what we do to keep the lights on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=35.2s)]
*  and the trains going. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  And at the same time, we're working to reduce the impact [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=39.08s)]
*  on the environment, particularly greenhouse gas emissions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=42.04s)]
*  of that business and grow new businesses at the same time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  And so we have to be able to do both. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=48.16s)]
*  The world's still using a lot of oil and gas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=50.28s)]
*  This year, global oil demand is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  at the highest it's ever been in history [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  and it will grow again next year. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  And so the acquisition of HESS will allow us to continue [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  to meet that demand. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=63.16s)]
*  We produce about one billion barrels of oil every year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=64.64s)]
*  And we need to continue to replenish that as long [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  as the world's using it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=72.4s)]
*  And we're also at the same time investing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=73.72s)]
*  in lower carbon forms of energy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=75.64s)]
*  And as the demand for those grows, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=77.72s)]
*  I think you'll see the mix evolve. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=79.52s)]
*  And can that happen fast enough to meet the goals of COP? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  You weren't there, but you've been watching closely, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=86.68s)]
*  Can that mix shift quickly enough to meet [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=87.92s)]
*  the emissions goals in 2050? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=90.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is one of the really big challenges. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=93.2s)]
*  And I think it's difficult for people that are not involved [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  in the energy system to appreciate the scale [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=98.9s)]
*  of the global economy and what it takes [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  to keep it going every day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=104.56s)]
*  If you go back 20 years ago, roughly 84% [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=106.48s)]
*  of global energy came from fossil fuels. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=111.12s)]
*  We've had 20 years of awareness about climate change, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=112.8s)]
*  of efforts to change the mix, build out wind and solar. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=115.88s)]
*  Today the world has much larger demand in total for energy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=119.32s)]
*  and about 82% of the energy remains fossil fuels. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=122.48s)]
*  And so it's difficult to change that mix rapidly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=125.44s)]
*  because of the infrastructure, the consumers of fuel, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=128.64s)]
*  which tend to be buildings, ships, airplanes, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=131.68s)]
*  things that have very long lives. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=134.5s)]
*  And so the demand doesn't change as rapidly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=135.88s)]
*  as I think a lot of people would like to see it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=139.0s)]
*  John Kerry being one of those people, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  he called out fossil fuel producers and Chevron [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=143.92s)]
*  in particular for not doing enough. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=146.88s)]
*  And he criticized you for not signing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  the decarbonization pledge. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=151.0s)]
*  Why didn't you sign that pledge? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  We're very aligned with the intent of the pledge. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=153.88s)]
*  There were some details of it that we were still working [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=156.32s)]
*  to understand better, but our goals are very much aligned [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=159.88s)]
*  with it and we're doing a lot. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=163.66s)]
*  When the Paris Agreement was ratified, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  we set targets to reduce our scope one and two emissions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=168.12s)]
*  by 40% by 2020. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=170.68s)]
*  We're well on the way to do that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Reduce methane emissions by 50%. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=173.28s)]
*  We've now issued six different climate reports, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=175.8s)]
*  sequentially task TCFD aligned reports. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  We've issued a special methane report. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=184.24s)]
*  We're investing to grow businesses in renewable fuels, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=191.28s)]
*  geothermal and other things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=193.4s)]
*  And so there's a lot of work that's underway [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  that's very consistent with the pledge [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=197.4s)]
*  that you're referring to. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=199.52s)]
*  And so, and we haven't said never, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  it was still, we're still working some of the details [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=203.88000000000002s)]
*  on that particular initiative, which is one of many [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=205.8s)]
*  that we've signed onto already. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, tell us what does Chevron look like in 2050? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=210.56s)]
*  You've made this big bet, you're gonna continue taking [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  oil and gas out of the ground. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=215.68s)]
*  What is the energy mix and what does that look like in 2050 [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=219.4s)]
*  as you're targeting to meet net zero, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=223.56s)]
*  at least for scope one and two? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=226.78s)]
*  Yeah, so we're a company that's been around for 144 years. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=228.38s)]
*  We were founded in 1879. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  And at that point in time, our products were used [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=233.66s)]
*  for lighting because most of the lamp oil [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=236.4s)]
*  in the world came from whales. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=239.38s)]
*  And it turned out that what was then known as rock oil [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=241.18s)]
*  or kerosene was cleaner burning, more affordable [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=244.8s)]
*  and more abundant than whale oil was. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=248.38s)]
*  And 50 years after that, we were not, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=251.06s)]
*  we were barely beginning to produce gasoline [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=253.7s)]
*  because cars had just been introduced. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=256.1s)]
*  And so through the evolution of our history, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=258.14000000000004s)]
*  we've seen the demand for our products [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  and the mix of our business evolved dramatically. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=262.94s)]
*  I think by 2050, that will happen once again. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=265.5s)]
*  The world will still be using oil and gas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=268.74s)]
*  I think we'll be producing oil and gas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=270.38s)]
*  But I think our renewable fuels business will be much larger [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=272.66s)]
*  than it is today. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=275.04s)]
*  I think we'll have a good sized hydrogen business by then. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=275.88s)]
*  We're just beginning to capture carbon in store. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=279.14000000000004s)]
*  We've got projects in both Australia and Canada [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=281.86s)]
*  that take CO2 out of industrial processes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=284.5s)]
*  and store them in the earth. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=286.82s)]
*  That will be a much larger business when we get out to 2050. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=287.7s)]
*  And I fully expect there are technologies [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=292.02s)]
*  that are not mature today, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  some of which people may not even be talking about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  that will become part of our business [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=298.56s)]
*  by the time we get out to 2050, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=300.02s)]
*  which has been the history throughout all of our existence. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=302.06s)]
*  You talked in our prep session about how you think [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  that dollars should be spent on technologies [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=309.17999999999995s)]
*  and investments that take the most CO2 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=312.54s)]
*  out of the air per dollar spent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  Does carbon capture qualify as such an investment? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=319.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of interesting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  Our belief is we ought to try to get the most carbon abatement [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=326.1s)]
*  for every dollar we spend. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=329.12s)]
*  And so as we look at our own business, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=330.1s)]
*  we go through a process where we look at the marginal cost [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=332.26s)]
*  of abatement for every emission we have, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=335.0s)]
*  and you start at the ones that give you the most benefit [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=336.94s)]
*  for every dollar that you spend. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=339.26s)]
*  If you look at public policy, people like McKinsey do the same [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=340.78s)]
*  thing across the global economy, and EV subsidies by some [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=344.85999999999996s)]
*  of their work reduce CO2 at the cost of $450 or $500 per ton [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  of CO2. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=355.61999999999995s)]
*  Carbon capture and storage by most analyses is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=356.94s)]
*  in the $75 to $100 range. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  And so it's nearly an order of magnitude more benefit [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=363.14s)]
*  for every dollar you would spend on carbon capture [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=366.5s)]
*  than you would on an EV subsidy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=368.26s)]
*  So we do think that broad-based carbon policy, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=370.08s)]
*  a price on carbon which is politically difficult [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=374.28s)]
*  but economically very efficient is something [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  that we should continue to work toward in this country [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=381.52s)]
*  and in other countries. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=384.2s)]
*  I just want to push a little bit more on carbon capture. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=385.52s)]
*  Does it make sense to basically pay to capture carbon? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=389.32s)]
*  I mean, are you siphoning investment that could be going [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=394.52s)]
*  into clean energy infrastructure to pay to capture carbon [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  that you are putting into the atmosphere by continuing [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  to burn fossil fuels? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=403.64s)]
*  Does that make sense as an approach? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=405.64s)]
*  Yeah, so if you look at the IPCC or other independent studies [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=408.08s)]
*  that are done, they'll particularly [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=412.32s)]
*  when they address the most difficult [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  to electrify sectors of the economy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=416.44s)]
*  So manufacturing steel or cement [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=418.64s)]
*  or aluminum require tremendous amounts of heat for the process [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  that is required to make these fundamental building blocks [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=426.76s)]
*  for our society. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  And there really is no other way other [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=431.2s)]
*  than using the combustion of fossil fuels to create that heat, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=434.0s)]
*  at least with today's technologies. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=437.4s)]
*  And so this is a process that can be used [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=439.38s)]
*  to capture emissions that are otherwise very difficult [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=441.56s)]
*  to eliminate without eliminating some of the things [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=444.84s)]
*  that we rely on in society. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, there may be advances one day that allow us [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=448.64s)]
*  to manufacture some of these materials using entirely [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=451.12s)]
*  different processes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  I would love to see that happen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=455.09999999999997s)]
*  But in the meantime, we need to have every solution. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=456.4s)]
*  I sometimes talk to people about this and you get [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=459.34s)]
*  into a conversation about we don't want oil and gas [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=462.34s)]
*  or we don't want nuclear. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=465.34s)]
*  As we rule things out and narrow the solution set, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=466.64s)]
*  it makes it much more challenging. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=469.14s)]
*  We actually need all of them and they'll all play a role. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=471.18s)]
*  And over time, that mix is likely to evolve. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=473.9s)]
*  So this helps to explain why you are betting that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=476.9s)]
*  with the Hess deal that there will be a need for oil [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=479.78s)]
*  and gas for decades to come. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=483.14s)]
*  On the Hess deal, do you expect to be able to close that? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=486.06s)]
*  You're facing an FTC investigation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=488.46s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=490.86s)]
*  You know, many large transactions. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=492.26s)]
*  We all file, you know, with the FTC when you announce a deal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=494.18s)]
*  And then the FTC can ask for more information as you go [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=498.14s)]
*  through the approval process there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=501.58s)]
*  So we're preparing, you know, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=503.34s)]
*  responsive documents for their request. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=505.62s)]
*  We don't see any substantive. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=507.86s)]
*  There's very little overlap between our two businesses. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=509.38s)]
*  And so we don't see a meaningful antitrust challenge there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=511.46000000000004s)]
*  We're certainly working with the commission. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=516.86s)]
*  We expect to close the deal next year. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=519.02s)]
*  You have in the past commented on mixed signals [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=521.4200000000001s)]
*  from the Biden administration on energy policy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  You had a pretty high profile dust-up with the president [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=528.7s)]
*  about a year ago. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=531.26s)]
*  You pushed back on some of his comments [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=532.7s)]
*  about oil and gas producers. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=534.38s)]
*  What do you see now? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=536.1800000000001s)]
*  What would you like to see policy-wise? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=538.02s)]
*  And do you still think that you're getting these mixed signals [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=540.02s)]
*  from the administration? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=542.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the discussion on energy [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=543.5s)]
*  and climate has become very polarized. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=545.9s)]
*  And it's become reduced to you're either for [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  or against the environment or energy security. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=551.74s)]
*  And what I think we'd really benefit from is a more balanced [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=556.0600000000001s)]
*  and pragmatic conversation about the topic. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=559.86s)]
*  There are really three things around the world that matter [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=563.7s)]
*  when it comes to energy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=567.4200000000001s)]
*  First, it has to be affordable in order to change lives, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=568.9000000000001s)]
*  to help an economy grow and develop. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=570.74s)]
*  Second, it has to be reliable. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  And I travel to places in the world where the lights go off [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=576.38s)]
*  in the middle of meetings. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's very difficult to build an industrial base [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=581.38s)]
*  to build an economy with unreliable energy [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=584.46s)]
*  or to have an industrialized economy like we've seen [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=586.5s)]
*  in Europe where their primary source of energy gets disrupted. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  So reliable supply and energy security matter. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=593.22s)]
*  And then, of course, the environment matters. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=595.58s)]
*  We all want to see a clean environment [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=596.92s)]
*  and a sustainable world. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=598.68s)]
*  What often can happen in energy policy is it can tilt to one [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=600.0s)]
*  of those and at the detriment of the others. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=606.36s)]
*  And so if all you care about is affordability, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=609.36s)]
*  you're going to get an environment [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=611.68s)]
*  that nobody wants to live in. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=612.96s)]
*  Reliability can create costs to create redundancy and supply [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=614.4s)]
*  that an economy can't afford. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=618.12s)]
*  And you can create vulnerability as we've seen in Europe if you focus [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=619.8s)]
*  on the environment that you create unintended risks [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=623.04s)]
*  on the other two. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=627.32s)]
*  And so balance is something that I think has been missing [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=628.6s)]
*  from this discussion, not only in this country, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=630.96s)]
*  but in many others. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=632.72s)]
*  So what kinds of unintended consequences do you worry are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=634.16s)]
*  being created by U.S. policy right now? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=637.0s)]
*  Well, we. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=639.8s)]
*  Energy security or supply. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=641.12s)]
*  Well, we certainly have seen a lot of growth. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=643.48s)]
*  You know, the U.S. is the biggest oil producer in the world. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=647.28s)]
*  It's the biggest liquefied natural gas producer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=649.2s)]
*  And so in spite of some policies that have evolved [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=651.4s)]
*  from administration to administration, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=655.12s)]
*  we're blessed with an abundance of resource and a very large [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  and capable industry and as the biggest energy consumer [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=660.72s)]
*  in the world, our economy has benefited from that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=664.64s)]
*  Over time, the risk is that we try to choose winners [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  and losers with policy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=673.36s)]
*  And, you know, government's track record there is not as good [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=675.56s)]
*  as market's track record of sorting these things [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=679.16s)]
*  out over time. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=681.2s)]
*  And so we really run the risk of kind of building up businesses. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=682.52s)]
*  You can look a little bit at what's happening right now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=685.88s)]
*  The EV production seems to be getting ahead [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  of consumer demand for electric vehicles. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=690.84s)]
*  And markets are really the best place to sort out this allocation [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=693.6s)]
*  of capital and evolution within boundaries [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=697.2s)]
*  of performance-based standards. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=699.04s)]
*  And so I think that we would benefit from policies [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=700.84s)]
*  that level the playing field, don't pick technology winners, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=705.08s)]
*  but set strong performance standards on environmental [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=708.0s)]
*  and other dimensions and then let markets sort out the mix. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=710.36s)]
*  Like carbon pricing, for example. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=715.12s)]
*  Yeah, carbon pricing is a great example. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=716.44s)]
*  How are you thinking about geopolitical risk these days? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=718.6s)]
*  There was an incident this morning, apparently, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=721.2s)]
*  a Houdini missile hit a Norwegian tanker [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=723.0s)]
*  and oil markets slipped, oil prices slipped. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=724.96s)]
*  How are you evaluating risk and thinking [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=728.84s)]
*  about the Middle East in particular? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=731.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, geopolitical risk is part of our world every day. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  We're exposed to the war in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=736.36s)]
*  We're exposed to the situation in the Middle East [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=740.08s)]
*  as a producer of natural gas offshore Israel [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=742.0s)]
*  for the Israeli, Jordanian, and Egyptian economies. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=745.12s)]
*  We've had a couple of our ships attacked [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=749.1600000000001s)]
*  by Iranian naval forces this year, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=751.0s)]
*  one of which was actually taken into a port [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=753.1600000000001s)]
*  and still sits there today, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=756.4000000000001s)]
*  another of which was under fire for several hours [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=758.08s)]
*  from an Iranian frigate until the US Navy showed up. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=761.08s)]
*  And we actually moved our shipping activities [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  primarily over to the Red Sea [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=767.48s)]
*  because it was, although, costlier or safer. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=768.92s)]
*  And, of course, as the situation now has evolved, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=771.68s)]
*  the Red Sea is subject to some of these same risks. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=775.24s)]
*  And so geopolitical risk is something we manage every day [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=778.76s)]
*  in every part of the world. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=782.6s)]
*  What is your view, just shifting slightly to the economy? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=785.72s)]
*  We saw inflation numbers this morning [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=791.0s)]
*  and heard from Janet Yellen. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=792.36s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  Are you in the soft landing camp? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  We certainly have been anticipating the recession [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=797.6s)]
*  that never seems to arrive. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=801.28s)]
*  And the odds of a slowdown but not a hard landing [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=803.0s)]
*  seem to have increased. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=808.16s)]
*  China has begun to come out of its post-COVID period of time. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, the signals broadly remain [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=815.96s)]
*  pretty strong globally. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=819.72s)]
*  As I mentioned, demand for our product [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=821.08s)]
*  is at an all-time high this year [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=823.64s)]
*  and is expected to go up again next year. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=825.08s)]
*  And so I would say that our concerns [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=827.5200000000001s)]
*  about a sharp slowdown have diminished [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=829.96s)]
*  over the last few quarters. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=832.2s)]
*  What about hiring? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=835.84s)]
*  What do you see in the labor market? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=836.76s)]
*  Are you still hiring the way you have been [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=837.76s)]
*  for the last number of years? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=840.0400000000001s)]
*  We are. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  And we tend to hire a lot of engineers, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  some operating personnel at our operating facilities. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=846.0s)]
*  And we've still got very high acceptance rates, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=850.1999999999999s)]
*  high application rates, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=853.24s)]
*  and have not had problems accessing talent. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=854.52s)]
*  We have very low turnover. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=858.8399999999999s)]
*  We've got about 40,000 people worldwide. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=860.0s)]
*  And our annual turnover is on the order of 3 percent. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=862.6s)]
*  So we don't have a lot of attrition in our business. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  And so our hiring needs are relatively stable. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  And we've been able to meet the needs without real issues. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=870.36s)]
*  But you haven't pulled back on hiring or slowed down? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=875.36s)]
*  No, we're, our hiring is as we had expected. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=878.1600000000001s)]
*  I'd like to go to the audience for questions [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=882.6s)]
*  if anybody has any questions for Mike, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=884.2800000000001s)]
*  either on the energy transition, the economy, COP. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=887.2s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you something then. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  COP was supposed to wind up today. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=898.12s)]
*  Now I think it's going to tomorrow. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=901.76s)]
*  They're having their final press conference [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=903.24s)]
*  and this draft agreement apparently will contain language [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=904.68s)]
*  along the lines of aiming to limit unabated fossil fuel use. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  When you read that, what does that mean to you? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=916.2399999999999s)]
*  What does that actually tell you as a guideline? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=918.04s)]
*  What does unabated fossil fuel use mean? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=920.64s)]
*  Well, so we talked a little bit [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=923.16s)]
*  about carbon capture and storage, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=924.16s)]
*  which is a form of abatement. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=925.76s)]
*  So if you're using fossil fuels, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  it's a way to mitigate that use by capturing the CO2. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=928.88s)]
*  I think the thing that this discussion would benefit from [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=933.6s)]
*  is there's a lot of focus on supply. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=938.32s)]
*  So let's use less oil and gas. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=940.6s)]
*  Let's use less coal. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=942.64s)]
*  There's not as much discussion about demand [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=945.2s)]
*  and constraining supply as we saw last year [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  when Europe had a forced supply constraint on natural gas. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=950.88s)]
*  If demand doesn't adjust with it, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=954.6s)]
*  just leads to a higher price. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=957.72s)]
*  And so the, I think a more productive discussion [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=959.44s)]
*  would be where's demand going? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=963.2s)]
*  How do we shape demand over time? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  And are there ways with energy efficiency, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=967.1600000000001s)]
*  which is not a very sexy topic, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=970.36s)]
*  but it's a really important topic, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=971.88s)]
*  is the best way to produce emissions is to use less energy [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=973.24s)]
*  and find ways to use energy more efficiently. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  So we don't have as many of these discussions about demand [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=979.84s)]
*  as we do about how to constrain or reshape supply. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=983.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think the demand side of the equation [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=987.24s)]
*  is part of the conversation that could benefit [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=989.2s)]
*  from a lot more discussion. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=991.56s)]
*  On the supply side, some people have looked [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=994.4s)]
*  at the oil and gas industry [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=997.64s)]
*  and looked at also this spate of deals, the consolidation [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1000.28s)]
*  that we're seeing, especially in the United States, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1004.1199999999999s)]
*  your deal, the Exxon deal, the Occidental deal, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1006.56s)]
*  and wondered if, are these signs of a sun setting industry? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1010.92s)]
*  Is this shrinkage? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1015.4799999999999s)]
*  Where do you see the industry going [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  in the next number of years? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1018.28s)]
*  Yeah, our view is that demand will continue to grow [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1020.64s)]
*  through the end of this decade. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1024.4s)]
*  It probably plateaus sometime out there past that, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1026.24s)]
*  but it's really hard, and we do a lot of different modeling [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1031.0s)]
*  and try to force demand down through a variety of assumptions [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1034.68s)]
*  about technology efficiency, economic growth, et cetera. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1039.56s)]
*  And it's really hard to bend the demand curve sharply lower. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1043.6s)]
*  And so, you know, we operate in a world [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1049.12s)]
*  where we've got customers today [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1052.28s)]
*  that we need to meet their demands today. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1053.8s)]
*  And our view is that that will flatten, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1056.2399999999998s)]
*  and so we will reach a point where demand for oil flattens, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1059.6399999999999s)]
*  and at some point in time it will begin to decline. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  But we're really talking decades, not years. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0cux_xV1I&t=1065.6s)]
