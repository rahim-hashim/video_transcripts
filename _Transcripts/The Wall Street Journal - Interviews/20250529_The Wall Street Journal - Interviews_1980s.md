# United Airlines CEO on JetBlue Partnership, Cheap Flights at Newark and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM)
*  So I had a whole plan for this interview. Yeah, and then you torched it. Sorry. Yeah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=0.0s)]
*  By coming out with this announcement announcement morning. Yeah about JetBlue. So you want to tell us what that's yeah [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  So we are excited to have a partnership with JetBlue [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=11.96s)]
*  I've always had a lot of respect for JetBlue particularly their customer focus and you know [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=15.22s)]
*  it's in the DNA from the time David Neumann founded the company whatever 25 years ago and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=20.3s)]
*  So this is a great partnership for us the two complementary networks. They're big on the other side of the Hudson [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=26.0s)]
*  We want to get back and so we're gonna have some flights to JFK [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=30.64s)]
*  But other side of the Hudson means not Newark not but Newark by us. So let me take since you said Newark [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=33.82s)]
*  Like this has been a huge perception issue, but it really is a perception issue first Newark is safe [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=40.04s)]
*  the FAA in any the FAA has three levels of control for controlling airplanes the tower the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=46.6s)]
*  Traycon and the center they go in order and any time one of those has any kind of issue goes down for any reason [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=54.28s)]
*  The others are there to back up you just automatically flip over that happens everywhere in the country happen often, but when it does its [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Routine training to flip over on the airplane. There's a system called TCAS [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=67.0s)]
*  It's completely independent a fourth level where the pilots have their equivalent of radar [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=70.7s)]
*  You see over there planes guys, so it's safe [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=74.2s)]
*  the good thing about Newark is is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=75.98s)]
*  The FAA is now take it. I've tried for a decade to get the FAA to do this. They're gonna own [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  Managing the airport capacity to have the number of flights equal to the runway capacity at the airport [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=83.44s)]
*  And so the Newark we had the best weekend in history [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  For reliability at Newark over the Memorial Day holiday best Memorial Day. It's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=92.56s)]
*  Likely gonna be the most reliable. You have the highest on-time performance of any of the New York airports this summer because of the changes at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  the FAA [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=104.94s)]
*  It's also by the way because we lost a lot of bookings and so there's not there's a lot more seats available [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=106.0s)]
*  It's gonna be the cheapest it's probably ever gonna be in history [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=110.0s)]
*  I don't really like that, but you ought to book [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=112.76s)]
*  And and it's gonna be the least crowded [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=115.36s)]
*  So, you know, this is this is short-term painful for us at Newark [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=117.44s)]
*  But it's long-term better because the FAA is gonna do what they do at JFK and LaGuardia [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=121.84s)]
*  Which is manage the number of flights to be equal to the capacity of the airport [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=126.0s)]
*  You're talking about safety, which is obviously the biggest issue, but it's delays that are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=129.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=136.32s)]
*  Making people yeah, but that's an avoid Newark [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=137.44s)]
*  But that's what's wrong about it and that's the second point I was trying to make in our ticket [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=140.64s)]
*  I guess which is for the first three and a half months of the year before there's runway construction through June 15th [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  But the first three and a half [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=149.88s)]
*  months of the year the most on-time airport was Newark better than LaGuardia or JFK and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=151.48s)]
*  Once the runway construction is gone and particularly now that the FAA is gonna manage it the same way they do LaGuardia and JFK [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  It's likely gonna be the most on time of the three New York Airport. It's gonna be the most reliable airport [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=163.56s)]
*  But nobody goes there no tons of people go there they need to come back [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=169.12s)]
*  Left at the moment [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=174.04s)]
*  The cheapest flights there that certainly this summer. So everybody is like rebooking their flight [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=176.04s)]
*  Yeah, this summer is good [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=180.92s)]
*  That's largely because you know, we were booked ahead and it was doing really well and this media storm around the perception of Newark [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=182.12s)]
*  Caused people to book away and so there's more empty seats. So the prices are lower than they always would be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=190.2s)]
*  Question for you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=194.72s)]
*  Do you regret the decision of moving your hub to Newark? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=196.72s)]
*  Well, no Newark is the one it's a decision that was made decades ago, right put it there [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=201.32s)]
*  But it is a crown jewel. It is the largest international gateway for any airline in the country [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=208.48s)]
*  We have more international flights out of Newark [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=214.72s)]
*  We serve all kinds of cities out of Newark that no one else can know of the you we serve more [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=216.92s)]
*  I would not undo it. It's a great airport is a great place particularly for a European [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=221.2s)]
*  Launching hub and we had done is really had real success [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  It had become about 35% of the total New York, New Jersey traffic was Newark [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=229.32s)]
*  Prior to to you know, the recent event and I'm just confident it'll go back because the facts are gonna win out [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=235.44s)]
*  It's the facts gonna win out. It'll go back to being 35% [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=241.44s)]
*  What is the one thing you would do to make sure that you're not going to be able to go back to Newark? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=246.32s)]
*  What would you do to fix Newark if you had that power? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=251.28s)]
*  Get the FAA to manage the number of flights to be equal to the capacity airport [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=254.28s)]
*  I've been begging the FAA to do that for a decade and they are finally doing it [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=258.52s)]
*  So like as bad as hard as this has been it has gotten you know this administration the Secretary of Transportation [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=262.0s)]
*  Secretary Duffy [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=268.32s)]
*  Has been great. He understood it the new FAA administrator understand that's incoming understands it and the FAA [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=269.68s)]
*  This is a problem that only the airport can solve the problem at an airport is for constrained airports [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  The airlines want to fly more flights in the airport can handle and so every single large constrained airport in the world with the exception [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  Of Newark has a recall slats. It limits the number of flights [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=291.0s)]
*  So if the airport can handle 77 operations per hour you limit it to 77 operations per hour [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=294.04s)]
*  And that's what every airport in the world does Newark used to do it for crazy reasons [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=298.48s)]
*  And it has caused Newark to go backwards and that like that is the only thing we needed at Newark to make it a great [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=303.92s)]
*  Airport, but that's now we're getting airlines flying more flights out of Newark and you're an airline [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=310.68s)]
*  So you had the power to pull back don't because it's every airline combined [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=316.76s)]
*  So what's that United has done it a dozen times pulled back flights to try to fix the airport and all that happens is two [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  Months later everyone else backfills it and so this is one of those that only the government can fix it because we're not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  Illegally allowed to collude with each other to coordinate flights [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=331.24s)]
*  I'd be illegal and so the only the government can fix it and Newark really is the only airport in the world [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=334.12s)]
*  That is in this situation that didn't have that before and now we have that regime for this summer [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=339.52s)]
*  And I think we'll have it permanently that's gonna fix Newark [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=344.36s)]
*  That's the one thing it's the only thing that we needed it's getting done and you have cut back 35 flights [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=346.6s)]
*  We cut back 35 flights just through June 15th, but that's while the runway construction is going on [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=353.32s)]
*  So there's there's and will you do more? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=358.3s)]
*  We're gonna add those back and so the schedule goes back [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=361.34s)]
*  So today we're at about 280 as of June 15th will be back to about 380 [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  But you get the runway back. So you double the runway capacity [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=370.86s)]
*  So 280 to 380, but with double the runway capacity you're doing like math fast here [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=374.58s)]
*  Feels like easy math [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=380.26s)]
*  What I hear is more flights at the airport that's already constrained but that's compared to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=383.18s)]
*  440 or so last year. So once you get all the runways back it used to be 440 now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=389.82s)]
*  It'll be 380 [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  So lots of flights still and on bigger aircraft to maintain capacity but the FAA is cutting it down [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=395.26s)]
*  But the FAA is cutting it down to that. What is it for us? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  For us, but okay for the whole airport. They're gonna cut it to 34 arrivals and departures per hour [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=403.66s)]
*  and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=409.1s)]
*  Which is what they think they get last year was scheduled as high as 43 [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=410.42s)]
*  And they just couldn't they can't handle that volume. So just means delays ripple through the day at 34 [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=413.98s)]
*  The airport will be able to operate [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  effectively and efficiently [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=422.74s)]
*  So what date is that June 15th? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  Everything's a okay after that everything's a okay [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=428.54s)]
*  I mean there's still be weather and things things still happen, but it's gonna be it will be I bet you [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=430.78s)]
*  The most reliable airport June 15th on it'll be the most reliable airport in New York. Okay. All right [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=437.06s)]
*  There's bad weather is gonna affect all the airports, but it'll be the most reliable of the three [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=441.98s)]
*  These issues with air traffic control related to Newark you see that as separate they're not unique to Newark [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=448.66s)]
*  That's another thing that's been frustrating about this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=456.06s)]
*  These the air traffic control system is old and has been in need of an upgrade for a long time air traffic controllers [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=458.3s)]
*  Or short staff their short staff throughout the country. It's more acute in New York and New Jersey [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=465.24s)]
*  Than other places, but it's been an issue for a long time [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=469.88s)]
*  What we've done to deal with that is again have backups [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  So again like at the FAA, they've got three levels that can back each other up [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=476.72s)]
*  We've got an independent system on the airplane [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=480.6s)]
*  There's some systems if people remember a couple years ago no Tams went down no Tams is a system that we use [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=482.5s)]
*  Before a flight departs is for flight planning and so when that happened, they're not a backup system for no Tams [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=488.76s)]
*  But the reason there's not a backup system is because it's done before an airplane takes off [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=494.52s)]
*  You don't need it after you take off. And so you just put a ground stop. You don't let planes take off bad for customers [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=498.16s)]
*  But it's never a safety. So I think none of these things cause safety issues. They cause delays [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=503.88s)]
*  And you know, it takes longer to fly from you know Delta said this Atlanta to New York than it did in the 1950s today [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=509.88s)]
*  right, even though our airplanes fly faster it takes longer because we have [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=516.36s)]
*  An air traffic control system that's antiquated and so upgrading it is going is not about safety upgrading it is about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=520.64s)]
*  Eliminating delays that are unnecessary that are built into the system today [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=528.08s)]
*  It's also though not unique to New York. This is like that's been the first year. This is it's the same technology everywhere [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=532.64s)]
*  What does it need to be upgraded? I just it needs to be modernized a modern system. I mean much of it is [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=539.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, you secretary Duffy showed it, you know, it's old copper systems [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=545.88s)]
*  They have their own network instead of using the kind of all of us use the backbones of the internet. They have a bespoke network [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=549.0s)]
*  You know and trying for one organization trying to maintain a bespoke communications network might have made sense in 1950 when the you know [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=556.04s)]
*  You started building this stuff, but doesn't today [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=564.14s)]
*  Is the most pressing problem there technology money or [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=566.6s)]
*  staffing [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=572.6s)]
*  Well, you need money for all of them, but staffing is number one [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=574.16s)]
*  You know, the FAA is about 30% short staffed. They got this challenge [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=577.68s)]
*  historically, although the secretary Duffy is changing this but all the controllers had to go through a facility in Oklahoma City, which [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  Apparently can't be expanded and at most they can take 1800 students in the front door every year [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=589.04s)]
*  But it's a pretty rigorous training program [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=595.12s)]
*  A lot of people wash out of the training program that you get the training you go out on the line more people wash out there [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=596.56s)]
*  So there's a pretty big washout rate [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=601.48s)]
*  and at 1800 [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=603.72s)]
*  in [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=605.76s)]
*  2024 so last year at the end of the day [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=606.84s)]
*  They took all 1800 in and they were if it was very proud we've maxed out the facility and we had net new [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=609.76s)]
*  30 net new controllers there 330 3 0 and there's 3,000 short [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=615.08s)]
*  That's pretty simple math takes you a century to solve that problem if there's no growth [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=620.16s)]
*  Like you just have to fix that like [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=624.16s)]
*  Businesses wouldn't and and secretary Duffy is doing it. So we're gonna get that fixed [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=626.48s)]
*  And then the money to upgrade the technology [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=630.82s)]
*  I mean the problem that the FAA has had historically from a funding perspective is there always annual appropriations [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=633.1s)]
*  So these kinds of projects are multi-year, you know, they've got facilities that are 50 60 years old radars go down [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=639.38s)]
*  They spend 92% of their facilities budget on repairs. I didn't know what the number was [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=644.98s)]
*  I asked our team and just coincidentally said we spent about 8% of our facilities on repairs [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=649.38s)]
*  Most of it's about building new stuff tearing down old stuff modernizing and it's because you got a 60 year old radar [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=653.86s)]
*  Like you got to go fix it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=659.94s)]
*  And so we need to give them the budget to fix it [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=662.0200000000001s)]
*  But that's multi-year funding and so if you're trying to do those projects and you're trying to do them a year at a time [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=664.74s)]
*  These projects all take more than a year [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=668.86s)]
*  And so they just they have this stop start stop start and that's happened for decades. It's not new. It's happened for decades [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=670.62s)]
*  So just have a whole mentality of band-aiding together and making it work. They do a great job [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=676.86s)]
*  I mean people do a great job of making it work with what they have [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=682.1400000000001s)]
*  but the thought the culture is not has not been let's [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=684.62s)]
*  Envision where we want to be five years from now and invest to get there [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=688.86s)]
*  It's about let's get through this year and then let's get through next year. That's what's changing [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=691.8199999999999s)]
*  You've made two two points in which you think the government is [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=696.26s)]
*  important you're [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=700.9s)]
*  making a pro government case here I [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=702.62s)]
*  The government is like we can't run the airspace without the government like they're critical [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=705.78s)]
*  Like this is the kind of thing the government should do this infrastructure and this is what government should do is infrastructure [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=709.7s)]
*  Should it be privatized? I just not necessary to privatize it [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=714.7s)]
*  but [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=718.46s)]
*  It's just about run it like a business would run run it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=719.7s)]
*  If you know do things like have a long-term planning cycle hold yourself accountable [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=723.18s)]
*  If you're the FAA to hitting your hiring goals [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=727.74s)]
*  like if we if we were 30% short of pilots and we were [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=730.38s)]
*  Delaying and canceling flights for that like we'd get skewered and we should get skewered if we were doing that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=734.54s)]
*  And just hold yourselves to the same standards that you hold [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=739.74s)]
*  Others and I think like I think secretary Duffy and Administrator Bedford who's gonna be coming on like they get this they're on it [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=743.9s)]
*  They're doing it like like I really I feel more optimistic today than I have in my entire [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=750.7s)]
*  Career that we have partners at the DOT and FAA who want to fix it before it's like [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=755.66s)]
*  Sisyphus I'm pushing a rock up the hill and it rolls back down on me [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=761.22s)]
*  And now we have a partner that is genuine sincere wants to fix it willing to fix it [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=764.18s)]
*  So I think we're gonna get done have you spoken with President Trump about all this I have how was that he he loves airplanes [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=769.98s)]
*  And airspace so it's good and bad. I suppose I [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=777.1s)]
*  Have long conversations about Air Force one [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=781.22s)]
*  But [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=785.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, he's he's into aviation. He [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=786.4200000000001s)]
*  Quickly he's smart. He quickly gets that we need to have you know [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=789.98s)]
*  This country deserves the best aviation not a second-tier aviation system and so he's supportive of it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=794.7199999999999s)]
*  How has this [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=801.76s)]
*  Newark situation affected your business? Well, it's had a it hasn't had a short-term [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=804.16s)]
*  Impact on us because of the perception again, it is safe [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  It's reliable, but people should look with confidence like now's the time to try it [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=812.68s)]
*  You're gonna get a better price than you normally will I wish you weren't but you will and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=816.04s)]
*  And so now it's time and I think that's just the key people try it they're gonna see like our MPS scores actually [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=820.76s)]
*  What's that new? Yes net promoter scores. So our measure of customer satisfaction [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=827.32s)]
*  Are the highest I remember seeing at Newark right now? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=831.88s)]
*  That surprises you but it's but it's because it's because it's because [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=836.52s)]
*  The reality is not what has been in the media [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=841.44s)]
*  The reality is the airport is reliable the air [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=843.88s)]
*  The reality is the airport is less crowded than it was before the reality is good [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=846.4399999999999s)]
*  And so people show up and it's the best that they've it's the best course that we've had [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=850.36s)]
*  So getting people back to try it I think is important leisure demand is almost back to where it was [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=854.48s)]
*  We took a big drop in bookings [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=860.04s)]
*  For for a few weeks. Well, I say numbers for a couple of weeks the load factors in in New York [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=863.6s)]
*  We're down 15 points last two weeks of May. They're gonna be down five points. June is now booked down three [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=870.16s)]
*  So it's coming back [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=877.04s)]
*  That's what pricing does that's what the pricing helps, but that's the key like, you know, like I wish it wasn't like that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, but it is good for consumers and you get people to try it and when they try it they see oh [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=885.72s)]
*  This is better than going to a little Gordy or JFK and then they come back [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=891.04s)]
*  I mean not everybody says that some people still complain about delays [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=893.92s)]
*  They did not a hundred percent [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=898.48s)]
*  It's also not a hundred percent of LaGuardia or JFK [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to some people this morning that the flu into the Guardian talked about the delays they're like, yeah [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  So it goes how will that drop in load factors affect United's bottom line? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=910.36s)]
*  It will have an impact [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=916.36s)]
*  But you know everything else demand trends have been stable and been good in this quarter. We were [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=918.76s)]
*  We'd given guidance of 325 to 425 in earnings per share [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=925.52s)]
*  If Newark hadn't happened we probably would have been at the high end of that now we're gonna probably in the middle [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=930.1s)]
*  And in your first quarter [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=935.46s)]
*  Results you talked about how and I may be summarizing this incorrectly. So please do correct me [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=939.5s)]
*  That you were running like your busiest schedule in your history [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=947.82s)]
*  We are we still yeah, is that part of the problem that there are too many flights out there? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=952.14s)]
*  We have fewer flights at Newark [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=957.46s)]
*  We're running we're running our busiest schedule in history, but a lot of it is gauge so we're flying bigger airplanes [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=959.46s)]
*  So at Newark, we've grown if you measure it by seats number of seats or if you measure it by ASMs [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=965.3000000000001s)]
*  We're bigger available seat miles. So it's the number of miles your flight times number of seats on the airplane [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=971.02s)]
*  Those are the typical capacity match [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=977.14s)]
*  We have fewer flights at Newark than we used to have but we have more seats and we have more ASMs [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=979.4200000000001s)]
*  We're flying bigger instead of flying a regional jet, you know from here to Allentown [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=984.62s)]
*  We're flying a triple seven to Paris and so we're using [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=988.98s)]
*  bigger airplanes and flying longer distances and then the airports that are not constrained places like Houston or Denver [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=994.34s)]
*  Where we've added where we've added flights Dulles is another place. We've added flights. So can we go back to your JetBlue announcement? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1000.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, um [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1007.3s)]
*  Did you think about buying JetBlue? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1010.22s)]
*  You know, I didn't think that was gonna be a laugh line [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1012.74s)]
*  You know mergers are hard and they're complicated I've done two of them in my career [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1022.06s)]
*  They're difficult. They're cultural, you know challenges integrating their technology [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1027.5s)]
*  challenges what we're really looking for is to have a bigger presence for our frequent fliers on both sides of the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1032.3799999999999s)]
*  Hudson to be bigger in places like Boston [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1040.26s)]
*  It's not just JFK, you know in Boston JetBlue and United the two of us are bigger [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1042.38s)]
*  or the number of the largest airline were bigger in the Florida than Caribbean than we used to be so it's really about our [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1047.46s)]
*  frequent fliers and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1052.06s)]
*  Getting that presence in some of those cities is important to our frequent fliers [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1054.26s)]
*  But you know, there's a lot of brain damage that goes with doing a merger. And so I'm reluctant to do a merger [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1059.5s)]
*  you know [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1066.26s)]
*  Do it well, it's just hard, you know to do them and and if you can get a lot of the benefits without [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1069.14s)]
*  The merger and and you know, that's that's what we've done here [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1077.1s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the budget airline model it's dead they look it's a crappy model, sorry [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1082.14s)]
*  It's like the model was screw the customer [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1089.02s)]
*  I mean it was like, you know trick people get them to buy, you know and [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1091.98s)]
*  Get them to come and then charge them a whole bunch of fees that they aren't expecting don't don't you know disclosure buried in legalese [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1096.6200000000001s)]
*  And like the line I've used is like their problem is they got big enough that they needed repeat customers. They don't get them [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1102.98s)]
*  But JetBlue isn't [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1110.94s)]
*  Not that at all JetBlue is like the poster child for customer caring. In fact for me personally it was a [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1112.94s)]
*  Epiphany moment a turning point in my career [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1121.02s)]
*  Many people in the airline industry think air travel is mostly about the schedule [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1123.42s)]
*  And it is that's the number one driver of how you choose. So you're gonna go to Berlin this summer [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1128.18s)]
*  You chose a full nonstop flight [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1132.82s)]
*  schedules number one [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1135.06s)]
*  But when the schedules are competitive other things matter and JetBlue back in the day put live televisions on airplanes [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1136.94s)]
*  I thought that was a gimmick, but I went and flew it and I watched people, you know [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1144.26s)]
*  I was I don't know 20 something and went and watched people on the airplane like holy cow [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1147.98s)]
*  They got this right and it was literally a turning point for me [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1153.06s)]
*  but JetBlue is I tell that story because JetBlue is founded in [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1156.18s)]
*  Trying to be a better airline for customers [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1160.78s)]
*  the budget airlines were founded in trying to have the absolute bare-bones lowest cost and then [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1164.1s)]
*  It's just two totally different. They may both be startups with two [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1171.46s)]
*  polar opposite business models [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1175.74s)]
*  But cost does matter for a certain consumer [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1178.22s)]
*  Yeah, it cost does matter and and and the price matters [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1181.82s)]
*  And in fact, one of the things that we had to do at United was build a model where we could not [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1186.58s)]
*  We serve everyone not just the premium customers [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1193.34s)]
*  But also those customers who do care about price and we're flying on the budget airlines [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1196.32s)]
*  So the way we did is two things one [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1200.14s)]
*  Basic economy our basic economy product which doesn't come with all the bells and whistles [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1202.82s)]
*  It's still a much better experience than flying on Spirit or Frontier comes and more bells and whistles [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1206.26s)]
*  It's a better airplane like a lot of it's better [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1209.92s)]
*  But so we had a effective basic economy product and second was gauge we needed to have bigger airplanes [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1212.8000000000002s)]
*  So we're flying regional jets and competing with them like we didn't have enough seats to sell [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1218.4s)]
*  We'd save the seats for the business traveler and not have enough seats to sell to that leisure price sensitive travel [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1222.8000000000002s)]
*  And probably 40% of our revenue comes from that leisure price sensitive customer [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1228.72s)]
*  So it's really important, but we needed a better model 40% of your revenue. What percentage of your seats? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1232.5600000000002s)]
*  It's probably 50% of the seats. I don't know exact the exact number, but right because I measure it, too [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1239.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they do pay less so by 50% of seats 40% revenue round numbers and are you do you feel like you're? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1245.5600000000002s)]
*  Turning your strategic focus to the high-end consumer. No, we're our focus is bill is on doing both [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  You have to do both. So the with the price is it with the price sensitive customers [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1261.44s)]
*  I think of it is we need to hold serve and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1267.16s)]
*  With the premium customers is where we win we win the match with the premium customers [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1269.68s)]
*  But we have to hold serve with the price sensitive customers [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1273.92s)]
*  How is the American consumer from your? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1278.28s)]
*  Vantage point, you know a lot better than when I read the Wall Street Journal every day as you know, I do whoa burn [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1281.72s)]
*  And a lot better than what people think like the consumer is holding in there and I [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1291.44s)]
*  Also think one of the things that's happening which we saw this happen [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1296.52s)]
*  Post-covid is there was a stock. There was an acceleration of goods purchased [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1299.84s)]
*  You can see it in the GDP data, you know inventory, you know imports coming in [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1305.22s)]
*  And it's now shifting back to services same thing happened during kovat people couldn't go out and spend on services. So they bought [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1309.84s)]
*  Cars and refrigerators and you know accelerated all that and then coming out of kovat. They were spending on services which include travel [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1317.04s)]
*  I think we're seeing now that rebound effect, you know, you don't need a second refrigerator [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1323.38s)]
*  If you bought one now you're spending on services, but the consumer is [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1327.18s)]
*  Resilient I would say are you seeing any like shifts in cabin or in using miles versus money? No [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1331.5s)]
*  The premium is the strongest if we see any we've seen any weakness. It's been in the domestic economy cabin [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1339.5800000000002s)]
*  But internationals remain strong and premium, you know, not even a blip [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1347.42s)]
*  Are you seeing any I [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1353.8600000000001s)]
*  Don't know sort of anti-americanism from outside the world coming in. There's less travel [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1356.9s)]
*  Canada was the was the biggest that we saw we saw about a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1364.94s)]
*  Nine percent decrease in Canadians traveling across border last. I looked at it was about five percent decline for Europeans coming to the US [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1370.0200000000002s)]
*  But our business is 82% Americans going to the other places so they've [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1378.06s)]
*  More than made up for that, but we if we've seen it. It's been very small. How's business travel looking business travel continues to [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1383.5s)]
*  Recover it's still not back to where in inflation adjusted terms. It's not back to where it was pre-covid [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1391.54s)]
*  But it's it's growing faster than GDP. It's it's inching its way back. Do you think this [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1398.54s)]
*  Do you think this and I mean tariffs are now [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1405.86s)]
*  Off again, I think maybe for a little moment who knows but do you think that will hit business travel? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1411.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, it hasn't really yet [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1419.06s)]
*  For like for us the biggest impact of tariffs is what's it gonna do to the macro economy and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1421.98s)]
*  You know, what's your view? I I'm much calmer than most people about the tariffs seem very [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1429.06s)]
*  Well, I mostly also I say like this isn't the last [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1435.82s)]
*  You know, I've had to say it to my board and others like every time like let's just all take a breath [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1438.98s)]
*  like this isn't the end game we're not to the end state yet and [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1443.58s)]
*  And so let's wait and see [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1448.06s)]
*  Where it all shakes out is your board nervous about I don't think so [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1451.46s)]
*  Okay, I mean, I think everybody a lot of people were nervous when it first happened, you know, the first whatever day that was [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1456.26s)]
*  When the reciprocal tariffs first came on and that was when I started saying to people let's just all take a breath [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1462.9s)]
*  Do you have any other feedback for the Wall Street Journal? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1469.26s)]
*  Yes, but I'll tell somebody on the app actually the app has gotten better [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1475.22s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal basically cover to cover every day since I was in college and every time you upgrade the app it's like [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1485.14s)]
*  We need to get you in our beta program [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1491.94s)]
*  Yeah over it right you I mean this everybody should take a page out of this book read the Wall Street Journal every day [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1495.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, cover to cover very good because you read three hours a day. I read about three hours a day on average [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1503.06s)]
*  So I read the Wall Street Journal [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1508.54s)]
*  I have facts of five magazines that I've been subscribed to for a long time that I read and then I read about book and [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1509.38s)]
*  Half a week and what value does reading books? I think everyone should do it. Although you got to have a curious mind [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1515.1000000000001s)]
*  I guess but it lets you connect dots that other people can't connect [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1521.58s)]
*  I think it's one of the things that I'm particularly good at not to be egotistical [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1525.42s)]
*  But I see things that seem so obvious to me and other people don't see them until after they are [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1529.1s)]
*  You know, I thought COVID was a that COVID was a global pandemic on February 29th [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1534.62s)]
*  2020 two weeks for the NBA because it showed up in northern Italy like you read it like of course [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1539.78s)]
*  This is a global pandemic and we're not like you read about it in the Wall Street Journal [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1543.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, you just but you're reading but you're reading all kind of that one I actually happened to have read over the Christmas holidays [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1546.9399999999998s)]
*  I'd read a book [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1552.34s)]
*  About how global pandemics had shaped society [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1553.86s)]
*  It wasn't about pandemics, but it was went back to the black death and all the way back China [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  You know for millennia and how those things had caused society to change it was just interesting [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1561.62s)]
*  But like that's in your head when you're following what's going on in China [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1567.1s)]
*  reading books just lets you connect dots and see things that most people don't see and [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1571.3s)]
*  Think about the future it does and think about the future of everything. We're all here [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1575.74s)]
*  What is the future of air travel? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1581.06s)]
*  so I [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1584.34s)]
*  This is probably less sexy and revolutionary than some the future in some places [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1585.54s)]
*  I think we're still gonna be flying airplanes and airports and well somebody admits a [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1589.82s)]
*  Transporter that'll put us out of business, but it'd be cool. I don't think that's gonna happen though [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1593.78s)]
*  But a lot of the near-term future I think is about [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1598.98s)]
*  Innovating for the customer making it easier to deal with like one of my goals is to get to where anytime [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1602.98s)]
*  There's a delay or any kind of issue on your flight at United Airlines [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1608.78s)]
*  I've what I've asked the team is pretend [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1612.86s)]
*  I'm on the flight and I have called the operating center and asked you what's going on with my flight [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1615.3s)]
*  What would you tell me I want to tell all of our customers that proactively just be open and honest as we can be [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1619.74s)]
*  And but a lot of technology things I think are gonna make travel easier [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1627.26s)]
*  For aircraft, you know, I think we're excited about supersonic potentially [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1631.62s)]
*  They got to extend the range of the airplane to be able to make that what supersonic flying fashion the speed of sound [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1636.3799999999999s)]
*  Supersonic aircraft so we got to deal with boom [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1643.3s)]
*  Okay to buy supersonic aircraft right now. It's an airplane that could fly from the East Coast to Europe [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1645.6599999999999s)]
*  I think to make it economically viable [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1651.1399999999999s)]
*  We need to be able to fly from the West Coast across the Pacific longer distance to get across the Pacific to make it viable [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1653.26s)]
*  Do that that would be really cool. When is that gonna happen? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1658.66s)]
*  I mean they say 2030 that means later, but okay in the 2030s they got us in the range [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1661.5s)]
*  I gotta set deadlines. I think it well [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1667.74s)]
*  Deadlines do help. I mean we signed our deal with jetBlue saying on that last night because we had a deadline of today [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1676.5s)]
*  If the deadline had been tomorrow it been tomorrow night [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1685.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that but sure it's way the world [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1688.02s)]
*  The other thing that I think is cool is blended wing bodies [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1692.1399999999999s)]
*  These are where this is like the b2 bomber [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1695.86s)]
*  The whole airplane is the wing and so it's way more aerodynamically efficient burns less fuel [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1697.86s)]
*  You can put more cargo on it. You've got more payloads. We have a picture. Oh, yeah. There you go. Well, there it is [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  I heard it looks like a flying triangle. Yeah, I think that yeah, that's what it is. It's a wing [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1709.02s)]
*  I want a paper airplane. Yeah, cuz I feel like it looks like I used to make paper [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1713.34s)]
*  I love making paper. My kids like making paper airplanes [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1717.8999999999999s)]
*  They're pandering to you they're not pandering they definitely don't pander to me [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1722.1399999999999s)]
*  But that's you know, that I think is gonna be [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1726.82s)]
*  How futuristic is this? Yeah, I don't know what the timing is on when they're gonna get built really [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1729.9399999999998s)]
*  But I'll say 20 years from now. They will have been built it will take less than 20 but 20 years now [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1735.82s)]
*  I think you're gonna fly to airports. You can see a lot of planes that look like that [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1741.58s)]
*  They're gonna need bigger runways. Well, it's probably not bigger runways because that's a wing. I mean like why they're gonna know [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1744.94s)]
*  those will fit on runways the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1752.46s)]
*  You're gonna have to make changes to the gates at airports. They're bigger [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1755.58s)]
*  So you'll admit but those are the kind of things we do all the time and we can do in a 20 year time horizon [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1758.62s)]
*  We can do it faster than that. Okay [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1763.62s)]
*  and what is [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1766.1399999999999s)]
*  The thing that you are most thinking about in the future my kids [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1769.0200000000002s)]
*  Like I think about I've had this goal of [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1780.14s)]
*  Since early in my career of building from business perspective the best the biggest and the best airline in history [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1784.46s)]
*  and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1792.0600000000002s)]
*  And [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1793.34s)]
*  You know, I started at Little Old America West and like that's my goal and it's now like to also create an airline [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1794.54s)]
*  That doesn't even feel like an airline to everyone else compared to what everyone else is doing [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1802.62s)]
*  That's about technology how we deal with you [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1807.18s)]
*  But like I go on runs. I don't listen to music because I like to dream [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1809.78s)]
*  I'm dreaming about schedules in my head and I got a lot of [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1813.54s)]
*  But you talked about your kids, how do you think about [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1818.66s)]
*  Sustainability [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, when it comes to air travel and the future [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1824.6200000000001s)]
*  So I have seven kids by the way, and I do care and I'm a climate change [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1827.42s)]
*  Yeah, an alcohol climate change geek back to decide. Remember reading the article about the sir [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1831.82s)]
*  Anyway, then on article that was really geeky about what would happen to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1837.86s)]
*  the Gulf Stream, you know with climate change and water melting in Greenland and and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1841.86s)]
*  And that got me interested in it and it's fascinating [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1846.98s)]
*  Science and I think we need to address it. We do need to address it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1850.06s)]
*  I think we I think the world is gonna it's a longer conversation, but [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1854.58s)]
*  Geoengineering is probably we're gonna have to head which I think is good chance. That's gonna work. That's different than the current path, but [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1859.06s)]
*  If you're interested, I'll tell you more about it. But I think it's really important that we do that [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1865.78s)]
*  And at United it also happens to be aligned with our business bear for us. The biggest thing we do is burn fuel [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1870.62s)]
*  Electric is not gonna work for big airplanes flying even medium airplanes flying medium distances not enough energy density [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1877.66s)]
*  Compared to the weight. So we're gonna be using [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1885.02s)]
*  What is chemically jet fuel? The question is is there a different feedstock that we can use to create instead of using oil [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1887.5s)]
*  Can we create sustainable aviation fuels and that's the big future. That's the big thing United is the leader [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1893.14s)]
*  In investing in this around the globe. We're still a really in the investment phase [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1898.38s)]
*  Instead of the use it phase but the other thing that we'll do from a business imperative is [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1903.1000000000001s)]
*  Eliminate our second biggest cost the risk of our second biggest cost which is fuel labor is number one [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1909.66s)]
*  But fuel is number two and so, you know [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1915.04s)]
*  there's a war in the Middle East and our costs skyrocket and if we can produce it from something other than oil a [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1917.06s)]
*  different feedstock then we [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1922.7s)]
*  Untether ourselves from that. What are the promising feedstocks? Well, there's a lot [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1925.82s)]
*  You know the most the most straightforward is [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1931.22s)]
*  To turn take the there's currently 17 billion gallons of ethanol produced in the renewable ethanol produced in the US every year [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1934.78s)]
*  That's used for cars road road transport [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1941.9s)]
*  And road transport, you know as Mary Barr said ultimately is gonna electrify [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1945.1000000000001s)]
*  Maybe not tomorrow, but it's ultimately gonna electrify [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1950.06s)]
*  And so that's a sort of a stranded asset in the middle of the country that could easily be used to produce jet fuel instead [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1952.46s)]
*  It's also the reason that I think sustainable aviation fuel has this unique [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1958.98s)]
*  Bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats Democrats more about the sustainability [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1965.46s)]
*  Republicans from farm states sort of more about that. That's not the only feedstock, but that's the most straightforward [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhKbjhR2CtM&t=1970.78s)]
