# Grindr’s CEO Is Building an AI ‘Wingman’ to Help You Date | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU)
*  So, we're talking about agents and to do a sort of extremely simplified overview, AI [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=0.0s)]
*  agents are kind of a step beyond chat bots, like chat GPT, in the sense that they can [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  actually do things for us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=12.24s)]
*  So they can actually take actions autonomously, so without intervention from humans and entirely [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=13.72s)]
*  on their own. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=19.8s)]
*  So, George, you... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=20.8s)]
*  I called them synthetics at one point, and I got a lot of flack with that, so I'm going [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=21.8s)]
*  to avoid that this time around. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=26.0s)]
*  Well, that's one of the things about agents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=27.0s)]
*  There's sort of not a widely agreed upon definition, nor verbiage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=29.12s)]
*  Okay, whether synthetics, agents, bots. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=33.4s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what Grindr is, and then what your vision for AI agents is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=37.36s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me here, and good to have this conversation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Grindr is the application that as many as you're gay and bi men in the world use to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=46.92s)]
*  connect to each other. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=51.68s)]
*  It brings together about 14 million people around the world in 190 countries. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=53.44s)]
*  There are very few places where we don't operate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=57.56s)]
*  Initially started out as a casual connections and dating product, and over time has expanded [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=61.36000000000001s)]
*  to be a lot more. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=66.4s)]
*  Basically, the connect issues were capable around the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=67.4s)]
*  And now we're a public company. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  We've been public for about two years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  I think coming up 23 months now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  We've had a really good run as a public company, and a lot more to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=76.68s)]
*  So agents, how are they going to transform dating? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  How are they going to transform even aspects of our lives beyond dating? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=85.24s)]
*  Yeah, I had built an AI company prior to joining Grindr in 2022. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  As one of the things I've done, I've been building companies for a long time now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=94.0s)]
*  And so for me, when they approached me about this opportunity, AI was at the forefront, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=97.16s)]
*  because Grindr has a lot of data, and has a user base that's very connected to the product. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  People spend over an hour in the app a day, which is fairly remarkable when you think [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=106.8s)]
*  about it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=111.16s)]
*  And so I thought there was a ton of opportunity for AI. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=112.16s)]
*  And the really big takeaway happened for me when I realized that all these use cases that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=115.28s)]
*  we want to expand into might complicate the app, because the app today is really simple. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=119.92s)]
*  But if you built them with AI first approach, you can actually avoid that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=124.92s)]
*  Because if the AI can guess the direction you want to go into, and then kind of direct [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  you in that way as you're surfing through the product, then you're not putting a lot [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  of additional buttons and places for people to go, but rather directing them in that direction. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=137.6s)]
*  And so we want to add a bunch of use cases to the product, because people use us in so [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=144.6s)]
*  many different ways, and we don't always have features for the things that people do in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=149.56s)]
*  the app. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=153.2s)]
*  But we want it to be very non-intrusive in people's behavior. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=154.24s)]
*  I think AI can make that happen in a really good way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=157.88s)]
*  So what were some of the things that you wanted to build before introducing or planning to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  introduce the wingman that it now kind of brings together? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=165.74s)]
*  The biggest one is around dating. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=168.58s)]
*  So when Grindr was started nearly 16 years ago, dating for long-term purposes was not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  as big of a deal for most gay men. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=176.18s)]
*  Since then, obviously, gay marriage has become fully accepted, and a lot more people are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=179.02s)]
*  thinking about, hey, I want to settle down into a long-term relationship. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=182.62s)]
*  And so we don't really have features to enable people to find long-term partners. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, a lot of people still do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=190.34s)]
*  Four in ten relationships among gay men in the U.S. originated on Grindr. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=192.38s)]
*  But it's all kind of done through chatting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=197.9s)]
*  People start talking, and then that leads into whatever direction it leads into. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=199.78s)]
*  We want to actually make it easier for you to find a partner and be able to match you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=204.66s)]
*  with the right people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=208.42s)]
*  There's a way to do that through current technology, which is mostly for filtering, or there's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=209.42s)]
*  an AI-first approach to do it, where we can actually guess what you want based on your [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=214.22s)]
*  behavior patterns, based on what you're speaking to people about and understand you a lot better. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=219.34s)]
*  Obviously, always we use the consent. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=223.34s)]
*  And that's something that AI can make a much better experience with and probably bring [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=226.06s)]
*  together people in a much more transparent way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  Because today, you can be on, say, Tinder and be matched, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=233.34s)]
*  But you have no idea why you are matched. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=236.58s)]
*  And I think that's a huge deterrent to people. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=238.58s)]
*  And if we could be transparent about, hey, this is what we learn about you based on your [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=241.06s)]
*  chat history, for example, and based on that information plus somebody else's information [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=244.54s)]
*  that's similar, we brought you together, that's a way more compelling proposition. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=249.06s)]
*  So what about the kind of agentic parts where the agent, some point in the near-term future, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=252.98s)]
*  can actually do things for us? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=259.42s)]
*  Is it AI agents dating other AI agents at some point? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=261.02s)]
*  Well, I don't know about dating, but at least starting a conversation, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=264.78s)]
*  Already, even before Gen.AI, through heuristics, you had applications out there that would [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=270.42s)]
*  suggest text to you, like, hey, this is how you should respond. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=277.66s)]
*  And initially, it was on the more like the enterprise side. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=282.7s)]
*  The user would be writing and then the customer service agent would actually get recommendations [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=286.22s)]
*  of what to say. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=289.78s)]
*  So there's no reason why that couldn't happen on a user-based level. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=290.78s)]
*  I mean, I think it's kind of like, how do I start this conversation? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=294.38s)]
*  What should I say? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=298.26s)]
*  It's a very simple thing that an agent should be able to do for you and I think will. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=299.3s)]
*  But the more ideal version would be not just like, generally, hey, these are the things [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=304.38s)]
*  you could use to start with, but rather based on how you normally talk and what you normally [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  say and what I know about the person you're about to chat with, here's suggested language. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=312.9s)]
*  And that's far more compelling than just a general set of ideas of what you could say. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  The next kind of batch of that to me would be, okay, you guys are talking about going [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=324.18s)]
*  out to get coffee. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=328.06s)]
*  How about here are three places where you could go get coffee in between where that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=329.98s)]
*  person is located and where you're located, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  Because Grindr is very location-based. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=335.82s)]
*  That's actually pretty convenient as well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=338.1s)]
*  And then the eventual step, yes, some people will choose to do this, some won't. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  We very much believe in not forcing people to do anything. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  They should decide on their own which direction they want to go into. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=347.66s)]
*  But for those that do choose to do this, there is no reason why some of the initial conversations [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=350.94s)]
*  and kind of validation can happen through AI talking to AI, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=355.58s)]
*  So I have a replica of myself, you have a replica of yourself, and those two talk to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=359.5s)]
*  each other. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=363.66s)]
*  We could be doing this panel via our AI agents at that point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=364.66s)]
*  Well, my husband likes to joke every time I have an earnings call and after earnings [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=368.38s)]
*  call we then have to do a lot of follow-on calls. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=371.5s)]
*  He's like, when is there going to be an AI that you can just press the button and answer [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=374.78s)]
*  the question? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=378.74s)]
*  Because all the questions are usually the same, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=379.74s)]
*  Like I get asked the same questions by 20 investors over two days. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=381.1s)]
*  And so I'm not saying that's actually going to happen, but there is no reason why we cannot [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=384.66s)]
*  better match you with an AI talking to an AI and then you get to get an output of that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  information and say, hey, this is what we talked about, this is why we think it's a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=396.62s)]
*  good idea. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, and then move on from it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, there's still stuff that, I mean, promise here is massive and in five years a lot of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  what we believe might be possible today will either be possible or be proven to not work. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=408.42s)]
*  But the models today still can do some very basic things that human beings take absolutely [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=413.42s)]
*  for granted. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=417.98s)]
*  And so I was going through this with, I'm an AI coach. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  And so kind of going through this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  Is it a person or an agent? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=424.94s)]
*  It's a person. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=426.38s)]
*  It's a very advanced engineer who helps me understand what is possible and not possible [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=427.38s)]
*  in models and so forth because I'm not an expert in that stuff as much. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=433.18s)]
*  And so we were walking through some examples. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=437.98s)]
*  If you are in a conversation and you say, you know, are you interested in sushi? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=440.34s)]
*  Now, what do you mean by that? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=445.82s)]
*  Do you mean by that that you're interested in sushi now or are you just generally interested [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  in sushi? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=451.78s)]
*  So that's something that a human will think about but an LLM can't yet figure out. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=453.9s)]
*  So then a human might respond in a very generic way as a lot of people do, like I'm not interested [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  in sushi. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  On the other side, are you reading that as like this person is not interested in sushi [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=467.8s)]
*  at all or they're not interested in sushi right now? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=470.48s)]
*  Because maybe I asked that question in such an opportunistic on purpose because they don't [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=473.86s)]
*  want to be so direct about the fact that we should go get sushi now. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=477.04s)]
*  And I thought maybe he'll respond to me in some other way which then allow me to actually [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=479.92s)]
*  suggest a day today. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=482.68s)]
*  And that kind of an engagement that a person is going through in terms of like what exactly [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=484.56s)]
*  I'm saying and I'm purposely not being that clear. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=491.8s)]
*  An LLM can't yet do. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=492.8s)]
*  Now not the models that are being developed right now but probably like two models after, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=494.28s)]
*  they should be able to do that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=500.2s)]
*  And that's when I think a lot of this agent can function on its own will become a lot [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=501.84s)]
*  more possible than it's possible today. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=506.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=508.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=509.4s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about how you're actually building the wingman. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=510.4s)]
*  What you've said is that in three years time you expect the wingman to be fully rolled [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=514.0s)]
*  out to your users. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=521.56s)]
*  And that's actually pretty conservative. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=523.4s)]
*  You expect to have it rolled out sooner than that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=525.2s)]
*  Yeah, but I've learned this is the second time I'm running a public company that you [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=527.32s)]
*  need to under promise and over deliver because a public company can be really punished if [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=530.96s)]
*  you promise things too soon. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=535.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=537.32s)]
*  So how are you actually going about building the wingman? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=538.32s)]
*  What's the underlying model? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=541.2s)]
*  Well, on my phone I have a wingman actually which I can be talking to right now and there [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=542.2s)]
*  are about a dozen people who are not Grinder employees who also have it today on their [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=545.52s)]
*  phones and they're giving us feedback. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=550.4s)]
*  It's all done under NTA and they're not allowed to share any screenshots of it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=552.16s)]
*  For better or for worse Grinder gets a lot of attention. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=557.12s)]
*  We sneeze and suddenly it's like we have some awful disease or not and there's a lot of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=559.88s)]
*  reasons for why and some of it is good and some of it is bad. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=568.28s)]
*  But we need to be really careful because the kind of attention we get out of a small hallucination [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=570.52s)]
*  could be really damaging. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=576.4s)]
*  And so we want to try to break the model as much as possible at this stage. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=577.4s)]
*  We're going to continue doing that probably for at least 12 months. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't expect to put it into a lot of people's hands without this NDA model for [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=585.68s)]
*  quite some time so that we can make sure that some of the more kind of flashy stories that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=591.4799999999999s)]
*  might come out of it, which every model out there is going to do, don't happen to us. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=597.28s)]
*  So I have a wingman right now on my phone. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  I can ask it questions and it will answer those questions. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=603.8s)]
*  Could be anything from like, you know, I've never had intercourse with a man before. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=606.52s)]
*  Like, what should I be aware of? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=612.28s)]
*  Which is like not a totally unreasonable question for a lot of Grinder users to have because [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  guess what? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  In a lot of parts of the world sexual information is not actually that accessible, especially [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  for same sex people. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=625.56s)]
*  I mean people who are in same sex relationships. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=627.36s)]
*  Grinder is oftentimes the sole source of information because we maintain a big database of sexual [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  information. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=635.48s)]
*  So instead of you going to go read stories about it, why not ask the wingman and it tells [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=636.48s)]
*  you what to do. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  To like, you know, I'm listening to this piece of music, like I really like it, can you suggest [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  other songs that are similar to that? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  So that already is possible for some people to use on Grinder and wingman is already doing [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=649.12s)]
*  things like that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=653.96s)]
*  We're going to continue to perfect it and make it a lot better. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=654.96s)]
*  And then over time try to build very concrete and specific use cases to see how people want [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=658.2s)]
*  to use it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=664.22s)]
*  I think the way Facebook has gone about releasing its element to people's hands is actually [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=665.96s)]
*  really smart in that it's kind of, I don't know if you guys have seen it, but whether [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=669.86s)]
*  you're on Instagram or on Facebook or on WhatsApp, they have a little circular button and you [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=674.22s)]
*  kind of click on that and ask questions. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=678.46s)]
*  And so what they are testing is like what kind of questions will people actually even [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=681.4200000000001s)]
*  ask? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=685.5400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=686.5400000000001s)]
*  The answer is important but maybe not as important as learning what do people want to do with [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=687.5400000000001s)]
*  it because none of us know. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=691.82s)]
*  I built a mobile company in 2006 or 2007 or 2008 on BlackBerrys and we put apps on [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=694.06s)]
*  BlackBerry which was very uncommon to do back then. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=701.14s)]
*  It was a way to book taxi cabs and to pay for taxi cabs. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=704.9s)]
*  We went into this very much thinking the problem we're solving is paying for taxis and electronic [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=708.8399999999999s)]
*  receipts because taxi receipts are a huge source of fraud in expense management and that's [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=714.42s)]
*  the problem we want to solve. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=720.42s)]
*  So now users actually didn't care about paying for cabs with your mobile phone but they really [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=722.3s)]
*  loved the idea of being able to book a taxi on your phone. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=726.3s)]
*  So our assumption of what people would want was totally thrown out of the window and just [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=730.18s)]
*  this extra thing we built purely to enable the payment was actually the thing that made [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=735.18s)]
*  the company work and then we ended up being one of the first apps on an iPhone as well [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=739.9s)]
*  and we're an iPhone commercial back in the early days, et cetera. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=743.4599999999999s)]
*  So you don't actually, you can have as good of a hypothesis as you want about what the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=747.68s)]
*  users will want but more often than not you'll be wrong and users will use it in a different [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=751.5s)]
*  way and so I think for us and for any company frankly that's just trying to be at the forefront [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  of using some of this AI technology for productization in a consumer friendly way, you should not [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=760.94s)]
*  make assumptions that you have the answer. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=766.38s)]
*  Just put it out there in a way that you can actually learn from users what they want to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=768.4200000000001s)]
*  do and then invest more in that and that's going to be our approach. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=772.14s)]
*  But that actually sounds really difficult, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=774.5400000000001s)]
*  So the common saying is you're trying to build or fix like a jet plane while you're [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=777.3s)]
*  flying it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=782.26s)]
*  That's kind of this but exponentially more difficult because the technology, the plane [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=783.9s)]
*  itself is also changing in flight. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=788.0999999999999s)]
*  Well I would say maybe we're trying to add a really nice new version of a first class [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=790.06s)]
*  seat to a plane while it's flying. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=794.2199999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'll kind of word it that way. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=796.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=798.14s)]
*  Because there's nothing to fix, right? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=799.14s)]
*  We're just trying to innovate in a really good way. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=800.14s)]
*  But as a leading your company and also providing direction to your product leaders, to your [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=802.0999999999999s)]
*  engineers, how do you sort of find that balance between setting a big picture vision for them [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=806.98s)]
*  and also kind of telling them while they're on the ground building this stuff, here's [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=812.46s)]
*  what you should do? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=816.02s)]
*  It's really interesting and confident. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=817.02s)]
*  It's going to bear with me as I answer this question because it's something I've had to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=818.38s)]
*  deal with for the last 18 months quite a bit actually. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=820.86s)]
*  So I think we had a vision for what we want the wingmen to do in a holistic sense for [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=823.7s)]
*  quite some time. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=829.58s)]
*  We want to do all these things. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=830.58s)]
*  Let's get there as quickly as possible. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=832.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's kind of at the level that we operate. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=834.1s)]
*  And then we kind of gave it to PMs to go figure it out. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=835.7s)]
*  But there's no such thing as an AI PM. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=838.66s)]
*  I mean, that's all totally brand new. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=840.62s)]
*  Everyone's just kind of learning. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=844.1800000000001s)]
*  The same way that in 2008, there was no such thing as an iOS engineer. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=845.1800000000001s)]
*  I remember in my company, Taxi Magic back then, we had this front end engineer who was [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=850.62s)]
*  really good. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=854.34s)]
*  And we're like, hey, Nick, do you want to go learn how to code for iOS? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=855.34s)]
*  And he's like, sure. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=858.1s)]
*  I'm like, OK, now you're the iOS engineer. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=859.1s)]
*  So there's a little bit of that going on here with what is an AI product manager. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=860.34s)]
*  I think the initial guidance of this very big vision actually created confusion for [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=864.42s)]
*  the team. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  And they tried to go after the whole thing when it's actually not chewable. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=870.8199999999999s)]
*  And the way it took me some time to figure out that that was going on. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=874.42s)]
*  And it was actually really slowing us down because we're trying to solve a problem that's [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=878.26s)]
*  actually not solvable today with today's technology. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=881.46s)]
*  It's going to be solvable in three years, et cetera, but not today. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=884.1s)]
*  And yet we're trying to do it now. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=887.46s)]
*  And that's actually a big reason why I then got this AI tutor to help me learn the tech [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=889.72s)]
*  well enough to be able to actually help them chew off smaller bites and understand what [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  might be a way to get from here to there in reasonable steps that actually can give people [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=898.3599999999999s)]
*  results sooner. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=903.88s)]
*  And so I do think that in this sense, more direction from the top is probably more necessary [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=906.0s)]
*  than not because there is so much newness here. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=912.0s)]
*  And ultimately, whether it's a CEO or founder or CTO or whatever whose vision is being [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=915.8s)]
*  implemented, probably needs to be more deeply involved in the product than you might be on a regular [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=922.44s)]
*  basis. So that's something I've been doing. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=928.12s)]
*  It's, I think, something that our chief product officer is doing as well. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=930.32s)]
*  Kind of try to be a little bit more directive and, you know, I think kind of clear about [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=932.4000000000001s)]
*  what result that we want to achieve. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=939.36s)]
*  Yeah. So by the same token, how are you also thinking about the risks? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=940.8800000000001s)]
*  So what kind of keeps you up at night when you're thinking about the ways in which the wingman [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=945.24s)]
*  could go awry or could hallucinate or tell users, you know, when they're seeking [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=949.6s)]
*  information, they might not know sexual information. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=955.48s)]
*  It could lead them in the wrong direction. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=958.36s)]
*  There's also questions about liability. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=960.4s)]
*  So are you responsible in that instance? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=962.0400000000001s)]
*  Data privacy is incredibly important to users. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=964.0400000000001s)]
*  The risk of a cybersecurity breach and also prompt engineering, the same sort of like prompt [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=967.0s)]
*  injections that can be applied to LLMs now could also be applied to agents. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=972.48s)]
*  I could go on. But how are you thinking about all of this? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=976.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's really complicated. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=980.08s)]
*  And I think everything in life is a measured risk. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  Like you have to measure risk with potential reward and how much risk are you willing to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=984.64s)]
*  take? I'm probably more on the higher risk tolerance levels than most people. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=988.36s)]
*  I mean, I have started three companies and taken them to something and most people [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=993.4s)]
*  wouldn't even choose to do one. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1000.32s)]
*  And for me, like, it's totally normal to do this. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  So my response is pretty high. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  That's actually a big reason why I think big enterprises usually get kind of challenged [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1007.0s)]
*  by startups is because they're not willing to take the risk. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1012.44s)]
*  So the biggest risk we face actually is to do nothing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1014.84s)]
*  The same way that there were many products for people to meet each other prior to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1017.84s)]
*  Grinder existing, there were web based products only. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1022.68s)]
*  And then the iPhone came out and there was a platform shift happening. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1026.68s)]
*  And those companies chose not to move to the mobile platform, gave Grinder a huge opening. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1031.96s)]
*  Well, those companies don't exist anymore. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1036.8s)]
*  And Grinder has the market share that they gain or gain from from them because gay men were [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1038.44s)]
*  online way before anybody else was in practice. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1044.48s)]
*  That's the biggest risk. We don't actually innovate. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1049.04s)]
*  And then someone comes out and does something that is AI first. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1051.12s)]
*  And suddenly we are then trying to compete with them. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1054.0s)]
*  So that would be, I think, actually the single biggest risk. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1056.36s)]
*  But in getting to from where we are now to where we are now, obviously privacy is critical [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1058.56s)]
*  and we are extremely privacy first. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1062.96s)]
*  We actually get challenged a lot about like, why don't you ask for ID verification? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1066.04s)]
*  Why don't you ask for a photo from a person that's a face verified photo? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1069.44s)]
*  Well, the reason is because a lot of people still don't have the luxury to be as open [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1073.28s)]
*  about who they are as we would like them to be and we and the world that we want them [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1079.4s)]
*  to live in. And that's not just true in countries where it's illegal to be gay or maybe [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1084.64s)]
*  not illegal, but very difficult to be gay. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1089.52s)]
*  It's actually true even here in the United States. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1091.64s)]
*  30 percent of our users are actively choosing to be discreet. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. And so we need to be extremely careful with their privacy information, because it's [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1097.08s)]
*  not a matter of like, oh, suddenly there's a breach. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's actually a matter of like, is there a life potentially at risk, et cetera? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1104.2s)]
*  And so privacy is really critical and we are very privacy forward. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1108.2s)]
*  We just released a new privacy policy recently, which users have to actively accept that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1112.72s)]
*  allows us to use data inside the app to train the model. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1117.96s)]
*  So far, we've not done that and we'll only do that with user consent. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1122.08s)]
*  And ultimately, a lot of what we'll be doing with AI will be based on user choice. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1126.8s)]
*  It will not be, hey, here's a product. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1131.28s)]
*  You must use it this way. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1132.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. It'll be this is available to you. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1134.12s)]
*  If you'd like to use it, you can. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1136.68s)]
*  But you don't have to if you don't want to. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1138.36s)]
*  Because that is really critical. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1141.36s)]
*  Secondly, I think I think it's really important to chew off what you can actually kind of [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1143.72s)]
*  eat in any given moment. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1150.96s)]
*  And so don't try to do something that's too much. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1151.92s)]
*  Kind of do it in chunks and see what the results are with it on all fronts and then do more. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1155.24s)]
*  So that's going to be our approach. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1161.24s)]
*  That's partly why we're being so careful and who gets access to this technology from us [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1162.72s)]
*  quickly, which, you know, probably slows us down a little bit. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1167.96s)]
*  But I think is a better outcome eventually at the end. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  But but again, I think for me, our users deserve to have a product that's not just good for [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1176.12s)]
*  among the other products that they use for something like this within the community, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  but actually totally deserve to have the very best product you can have in the world. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1185.6799999999998s)]
*  And that's the kind of company I want us to be. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1189.84s)]
*  Right. We are the second gay company to be public ever. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1192.04s)]
*  The other one's not public anymore. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1197.1599999999999s)]
*  So the only gay company, meaning like a company that serves. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1198.28s)]
*  Who was the first? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1201.0s)]
*  Planet out back in the kind of first tech bubble period in 2000, 2001. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1201.84s)]
*  And so, like, I think for us, we have a little bit of a responsibility to be successful and not [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1209.0s)]
*  just like, OK, successful, but exceptionally successful. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  Because if we do that, we change people's perception about gay people around the world. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1216.48s)]
*  And that's really, really beneficial. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1220.64s)]
*  And so I want us to be the very best product, not just because I want our users to have [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1222.28s)]
*  their best product, because I want that to send a message. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1226.4s)]
*  Hey, look at what's possible. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1228.24s)]
*  The same way that Martina Navratilova becoming an amazing tennis player in the 1980s and 1990s [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1230.12s)]
*  forced people to change their perceptions of what it was to be gay and helped make it [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1237.76s)]
*  much more acceptable to people. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1243.24s)]
*  I think Render being really, really successful will force people to think about what it's [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1245.52s)]
*  like to be gay and force acceptance in a better way. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. And also being the first major dating app to talk about having an AI agent. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  So you're kind of setting the bar in technology. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1259.04s)]
*  Hopefully. I mean, actually, everyone's going to talk about it and is going to do something. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1262.48s)]
*  So, yeah, that's not why I'm talking about it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1265.52s)]
*  I'm talking about it because actually I want to get people used to the fact of where we [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1267.12s)]
*  want to go. One of the reasons to talk about this stuff in advance is so that when it [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1269.88s)]
*  happens, users are not as surprised that, hey, this is the direction that you're going [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1273.24s)]
*  into. But my point is, I think we have a responsibility to build a really amazing product [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1276.76s)]
*  that releases the full potential of what we can be for users. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1281.56s)]
*  And that's a big reason why I think it's important for us to be at the forefront of this. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1285.0s)]
*  All right. So I think we have time for just one or two questions from the audience here. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1288.48s)]
*  Well, I have plenty more questions for you, George. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1296.0400000000002s)]
*  So when we talked about the sort of risks, you'd said that you can't afford not to make [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1298.64s)]
*  the big bets in technology and also that you're asking user privacy, you're asking users [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1304.68s)]
*  if they want to consent to this upfront. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1312.6000000000001s)]
*  You're being very proactive. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1314.2s)]
*  But still, how do you think about liability? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  Are your investors concerned about what I could do, where it might mess up? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1319.1599999999999s)]
*  I think the biggest risk on the messing up, at least that I can imagine right now, is [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1326.08s)]
*  around hallucinations, whether and we can have liability protections on that and we [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1330.36s)]
*  will obviously. But nevertheless, you know, I said something that is not supposed to say [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1336.36s)]
*  or it's not good to say. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1342.12s)]
*  Then there's like screenshots about that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1344.8s)]
*  Then someone tweets about it and then takes over. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I know people saw but like a parody site during the Republican National Convention [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1348.9199999999998s)]
*  had this little story of saying, you know, grinded usages up 30 percent or something [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1354.04s)]
*  in Milwaukee and literally 200 million views of that video took place in three days. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1359.12s)]
*  So I mean, I don't know how much brand marketing would have been made, how many dollars [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  you'd have to spend to get that kind of brand marketing, but that happens all the time. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1370.2s)]
*  So I can imagine how a hallucination like imagery could be really negative. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1372.88s)]
*  And so that we have to be really careful about that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  And we are. And we put a lot of protections in place to try to manage for that. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1379.92s)]
*  But it'll still break and we just need to be prepared for that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1384.1200000000001s)]
*  And then secondly, you know, it could lead people to do something that they're not [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1386.92s)]
*  supposed to do themselves, right, because it message something. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1390.76s)]
*  But again, ultimately, users have to be responsible for their own lives. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1394.68s)]
*  But I get into my Tesla at my house every day and literally right out of the garage, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1398.08s)]
*  I turn on self-driving and it drives me to the office. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1403.56s)]
*  And, you know, there's one place where I have to intervene and that's the only one I [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1406.2s)]
*  want to intervene in. Otherwise, it drives itself. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1411.36s)]
*  But I'm taking on that liability. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1413.32s)]
*  And that's my choice to do that. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1415.2s)]
*  You have the alternative. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1418.32s)]
*  If you get lost, you're not blaming Elon. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1419.04s)]
*  No, I'm not blaming Elon. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1420.56s)]
*  And also, if I get into an accident, I'm not blaming Elon. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1421.92s)]
*  That's on me. On the flip side, you could take the approach that Wayne has taken, which [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1423.6s)]
*  is like we're going to make this absolutely perfect before it's in users hands. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1427.6s)]
*  That's too risky. I don't know if you'll ever kind of get there. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1431.12s)]
*  And frankly, whether it's going to be economical or not. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1433.8s)]
*  We're almost out of time. So let me just end on a quick one. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1437.0s)]
*  What are some takeaways for the enterprise? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1439.8s)]
*  I know you're building for a consumer audience, but in being a company that's sort of at [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1441.4399999999998s)]
*  the forefront of talking about agentic technology now, what have you learned so far [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1446.48s)]
*  that can be applicable to any company? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1450.12s)]
*  Well, I think for enterprise, I think the bigger question is on how are you going to [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  use all this capability to make your teams a lot more productive? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1456.28s)]
*  And I think you may be using these technologies inside your own. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1461.72s)]
*  Exactly. Right. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1464.84s)]
*  I mean, I think I think engineers in three years are going to be on average two X [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1465.8799999999999s)]
*  more productive than they are today. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1470.76s)]
*  And that's going to have massive implications for our workforce and how we work. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1472.92s)]
*  And I don't think we're grappling with that almost at all, because there's days coming [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1477.76s)]
*  when you actually won't really need a lot of junior engineers. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1481.96s)]
*  I'm not saying you won't want them. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1484.6799999999998s)]
*  You still want them because you cannot have senior engineers without junior engineers, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1485.96s)]
*  because somehow people have to grow up to be senior engineers. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1488.72s)]
*  But there's going to be a period of time when you have a lot of senior engineers and then [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1491.36s)]
*  they could just be supported by a bunch of AI to do what the junior engineer does. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1494.4399999999998s)]
*  And that's going to make companies way more productive and way more profitable. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1499.96s)]
*  And how we deal with that, I don't think we're in any way prepared for it. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fwpOduMYU&t=1502.9199999999998s)]
