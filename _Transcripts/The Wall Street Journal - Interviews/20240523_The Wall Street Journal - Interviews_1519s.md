# Ray Dalioâ€™s Principles of Investing in a Changing World | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g)
*  I want to start, Ray, you have a book, Principles for Dealing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=0.0s)]
*  with a Changing World Order, in which you take a very broad [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=4.44s)]
*  historical view of, or a very broad view of history and look [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=8.64s)]
*  at cycles and think about, and study them and think [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=12.4s)]
*  about how the world is evolving and has evolved. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=15.26s)]
*  And if I can sort of summarize it a little bit, it's, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=18.0s)]
*  you're looking at the cycles and then you're looking [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=20.44s)]
*  at the present moment and you're seeing where we are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  in those cycles and it doesn't look so good. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=24.44s)]
*  Is that it in a nutshell? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=28.16s)]
*  In a nutshell, I'll embellish on it a little bit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=30.68s)]
*  Please embellish. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=34.36s)]
*  Like I'm a very practical market guy who's got a global macro [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  investor, who's got a place bet. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=39.36s)]
*  And in my life, there have been a number of times [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  where things came along that I never saw before [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=44.6s)]
*  and they surprised me, cost me money. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=47.88s)]
*  And then I realized that when I studied history [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=50.64s)]
*  that they happened many times in history repeatedly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  So there were three things that are happening now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=57.64s)]
*  in our lifetimes that never happened before. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=60.2s)]
*  And that led me to do the study and then I found [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  that there are five big influences. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=65.84s)]
*  Okay, the three things is the amount of debt [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  and money creation, the monetization of the debt [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=71.36s)]
*  and creations of huge amount of debts. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=74.32s)]
*  And I wanted to study the rises and declines [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  of reserve currencies and all of that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=79.16s)]
*  The second is the amount of internal conflict, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=81.84s)]
*  populism of the left, populism of the right [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  that is operating as a, that conflict, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  almost a threat to our system. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=92.26s)]
*  And number three was the great power conflict [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=94.4s)]
*  between particularly China and the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=96.98s)]
*  So in my whole lifetime, the United States [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=99.66s)]
*  was a more dominant power [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=102.98s)]
*  and now we have a great power conflict. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=104.5s)]
*  So I needed to study those three things [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=106.86s)]
*  and then in studying that history, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  I found out that the fourth force was acts of nature. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=110.62s)]
*  Droughts, floods and pandemics killed more people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=115.78s)]
*  and toppled more orders than the first three. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  So they're a big issue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=121.22s)]
*  And of course, climate is a very big issue. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=122.7s)]
*  Cost wise, what it means. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  And number five, of course, is man's evolution [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=127.26s)]
*  in their understanding and particularly technology. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=131.5s)]
*  And so we know that technology is going to be a giant force. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=134.74s)]
*  So I needed to study the patterns or the histories [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=139.46s)]
*  and the cause effect relationships. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=142.34s)]
*  And by studying it over that 500 years, it helped me a lot, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=144.1s)]
*  which by the way is not just in the book, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=148.22s)]
*  but also I did a video that I think is about 40 minutes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  called the changing world order. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  And if you want to see the video, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=156.74s)]
*  you can get it in a nutshell. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=158.26s)]
*  So help us understand how you think about taking five [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=160.26s)]
*  very, very broad observations, trends, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=164.1s)]
*  things that you see from history. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=168.18s)]
*  How do you take that and turn that into investible actions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=169.38s)]
*  or even forget about investing or take investing, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=173.54s)]
*  but then also take how you live your life, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=176.42s)]
*  how you think about your aspirations, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=178.34s)]
*  how you think about where you want your life to go, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=180.94s)]
*  where you want your children's life to go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=183.62s)]
*  How do you take those big things [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=184.73999999999998s)]
*  and turn them into daily decisions? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, the first thing I need to do is convert it into data [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  so that I can objectively see things. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  So you'll see in the book, for example, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=196.98s)]
*  there's relative education levels, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=198.98s)]
*  relative 18 measures that go back over the 500 year period [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  so that you can see the cause effect relationships. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=205.54s)]
*  I then take those and convert those into indicators. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=209.06s)]
*  And then that then helps me in my decision rules. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  I call those principles, but in other words, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  if this, this, and this is happening. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  So for example, I wrote the book about three years ago [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=221.54s)]
*  and there's an arc there [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  about the cause effect relationships. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=227.7s)]
*  Since then, there's the January 6th, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=229.9s)]
*  there's the internal political conflicts, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=231.9s)]
*  there are these conflicts blossoming. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=234.14s)]
*  And I understand them better because I know how to measure them [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=236.7s)]
*  and use them as indicators such as economic warfare, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  proceeds military warfare. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  Doesn't mean anything is predestined, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=245.38s)]
*  but when you can understand it like the progression [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=247.62s)]
*  of a disease or something, it's important. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=250.14s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people make the mistake [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  of seeing everything close up, up close. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  And so they don't see a lot of the big things that are happening. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=258.98s)]
*  They're focusing on today's news, today's developments, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=261.98s)]
*  and then they don't have that arc. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=265.86s)]
*  But there is an arc since over the last three years, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=267.62s)]
*  it's sort of playing out in the direction of that arc. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=270.94s)]
*  So I understand it better, I use the indicators [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=274.58s)]
*  and then I make the decision. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=277.22s)]
*  So you see the arc and we can, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=278.54s)]
*  I think if I'm not overinterpreting the arc as sort [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=279.9s)]
*  of in this side of the arc and not this side of the arc. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=282.46s)]
*  Well, I guess. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=285.94s)]
*  Yes, so let me, I'll describe a little bit the arc if you want. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=288.06s)]
*  Okay. There's a world order and there's a domestic order. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=295.9s)]
*  And so at the beginning, this world order began in 1945, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  the end of World War II. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=306.46s)]
*  There's usually a civil war or an external war that changes who wins, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=307.74s)]
*  who loses, and how the system works. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=313.7s)]
*  Then a new system, a new order comes into power. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  And then at that time, then there's a rebuilding and also nobody wants [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=319.06s)]
*  to go back to war and there's a dominant power [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=324.38s)]
*  because whoever won, nobody wants to fight the war. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  And because there's a restructuring of everything, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=330.18s)]
*  it begins anew, that you eliminate the debts. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=333.54s)]
*  You do that cleansing and then you rebuild. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=336.3s)]
*  And that's a period of prosperity and so on and it goes on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=339.14s)]
*  And people extrapolate that prosperity, they become comfortable with it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=343.54s)]
*  But the issue is then as they do that, they tend to acquire more debt [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=347.46s)]
*  for a variety of reasons. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=351.82s)]
*  And also when the country becomes a world's reserve currency, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=353.46s)]
*  other countries want to save in that currency [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=357.3s)]
*  and that creates more debt and more, and then also by its very nature, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=360.1s)]
*  capitalism creates very big income and wealth gaps. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=365.54s)]
*  So as it emerges, you have these larger wealth, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  larger and larger wealth gaps, and you also have larger values gaps. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=372.42s)]
*  So, and that happens domestically. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=377.42s)]
*  Internationally, the same sort of thing happens in that countries rise. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=380.18s)]
*  In other words, the gap and the control doesn't any longer remain dominant. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=385.06s)]
*  So there's competitors and countries and so on, and they rise. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=388.74s)]
*  And we don't have a legal system that resolves those disputes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=392.38s)]
*  So because of that, then you come into a period of greater conflict and later. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=395.62s)]
*  So you have the elements that I talked about in the beginning, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=401.1s)]
*  the debt element, the capitalism element, the splitting [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=404.46s)]
*  between the various interests and also the wealth [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=408.9s)]
*  and the values differences. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=413.66s)]
*  And then you have the great power conflict. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=416.1s)]
*  Now, how that's produced, what transpires is that after such a long time [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=418.18s)]
*  after wars, people, the new generation never experienced war. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=424.82s)]
*  And then there is an inclination to have conflict because, and let's say today, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=428.7s)]
*  I think we're in the environment that we see that you have to pick a side [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=433.78s)]
*  and choose, and then there's a conflict on that side. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=439.34s)]
*  The idea of compromise sounds weak. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  It's one of those things, what, compromising what's essential to me? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=447.5s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=452.02s)]
*  And that creates then threats in the system. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=453.34s)]
*  And you're describing the current, that's how you see the current moment. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=455.94s)]
*  That's where you see us right now in the world. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=458.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=462.06s)]
*  There are irreconcilable differences. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=462.94s)]
*  We're now talking about the political part of that, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  Number two is what I'm referring to. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=467.41999999999996s)]
*  They are also number one, the increasing debt loads, the increasing power conflicts. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=469.73999999999995s)]
*  So all of those things are kind of on the. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  They all relate to each other. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=476.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=478.82s)]
*  So you have the increasing debt, and then the question is, can you cut spending, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=479.54s)]
*  or do you monetize the debt? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  And okay, so think about how we're going to deal with the debt issue in the future, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=488.70000000000005s)]
*  in the political parts of that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=494.54s)]
*  And that has an influence of who pays, or are you going to monetize the debt? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=501.94s)]
*  I mean, I'm a journalist, I'm a professional skeptic, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=503.1s)]
*  but can I take the optimistic side for a moment? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=505.66s)]
*  And then there have been a lot of predictions that the US would decline, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=507.82s)]
*  and the US would lose its reserve currency status, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=513.1s)]
*  and the euro would take over, and China would become the world's largest economy, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=515.22s)]
*  and the US was on a sort of inexorable decline, and none of that has happened. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=518.3s)]
*  Look, I'm not. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=522.62s)]
*  I'm just describing what is, and the cause affect relationships. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=528.9s)]
*  What we do now determines what will happen. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=533.66s)]
*  So you don't think it's baked into a cycle of history [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=537.5s)]
*  that inevitably we're going to have some crash or some bigâ€¦ [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=540.02s)]
*  No, I think that the whole, it all comes down to how people deal with each other. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=544.7s)]
*  It all comes down. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=550.26s)]
*  We have more resources than we've ever had in the world. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=551.58s)]
*  We have more of almost anything that we have, and how we deal with each other, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=555.6600000000001s)]
*  whether we're going to fight about those things or whether we're going to deal smart. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=561.1800000000001s)]
*  The issue is in this dynamic is that the polarity becomes so great [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=564.66s)]
*  that the decision-making becomes so bad that it makes it difficult. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=569.26s)]
*  And then in addition, there are the realities that have to be dealt with, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=574.0600000000001s)]
*  such as, okay, it's not the same when you have a lot of debt, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=577.7s)]
*  and that you have to get into a lot of more debt in order to have your spending [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=582.5s)]
*  than if those circumstances weren't the same. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=586.98s)]
*  So when I look at countries, I look at basically what I would look at as individuals. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=589.4599999999999s)]
*  Do they earn more than they spend? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=594.86s)]
*  Are they operating well together? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=596.9799999999999s)]
*  And are they at risk of a war? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=599.3s)]
*  And so I think that those are going to be the drivers of what happens in the future. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=602.5s)]
*  I think we're going to see it in the elections and so on. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=608.74s)]
*  I think that itâ€¦ but it's not just those, it's the five. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=612.38s)]
*  So it went like, for example, if we're dealing with, let's say, the climate issue. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=615.5s)]
*  The climate issue estimated cost of that is $8 trillion a year. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=619.18s)]
*  That's monetary part of that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=622.8599999999999s)]
*  $8 trillion a year is equivalent to 8% of world GDP. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=624.78s)]
*  I mean, that's very expensive. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=629.5s)]
*  So there's an economic component and an environmental component. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=630.9799999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, technology is going to have a giant effect. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=634.62s)]
*  We know we're talking about AI and so on. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=639.26s)]
*  So we can see that the interrelationships between those are going to be important. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=641.6999999999999s)]
*  So basically what I do is there's a cycle. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=647.7s)]
*  Think of it like if there's a disease. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=650.62s)]
*  I use cancer as an example. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=652.46s)]
*  There's stage one, there's stage two, three, four, and so on. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=654.38s)]
*  You could see what the stages are by the symptoms. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=658.0600000000001s)]
*  And you can know how it ordinarily progresses. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=661.26s)]
*  So you have to know those kind of cause-effect relationships. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=664.3s)]
*  Those stages are laid out in the book. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=667.98s)]
*  There are six stages of a typical cycle. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=669.9s)]
*  So all I'm doing is I'm following how is it going according to those stages. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=672.42s)]
*  What are the cause-effect relationships? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=677.06s)]
*  And I'm understanding it better and it helps me bet, which was the same as in the 30s. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=679.02s)]
*  I studied my studying the 30s allowed me to make the good decisions in 2008 because I [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=684.18s)]
*  understood the dynamics. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=690.3s)]
*  I want to zoom in on the helps you understand how to bet and really zoom way in from the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=691.3s)]
*  big to the very small. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=696.4599999999999s)]
*  So maybe we could ground this with a very basic straightforward markets question, which [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=698.18s)]
*  is everybody has been thinking about interest rates. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=703.66s)]
*  The thinking about consensus thinking about interest rates has changed massively over [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=706.14s)]
*  the last year. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=709.3s)]
*  What do you think will happen with interest rates by the end of this year? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=710.5s)]
*  Are we going to see any cuts, no cuts, hikes? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=713.2199999999999s)]
*  What is your take on? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=716.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to answer your question, but I'm going to preface it with what are the determinants [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=717.3399999999999s)]
*  that make that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to see how you get from the cycles to... [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=724.74s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=727.14s)]
*  So for example, when I look at the bond rate, bond interest rates, you have to have interest [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=728.62s)]
*  rates high enough that it satisfies the creditor without having them so high that it hurts [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  the debtor too badly. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=740.58s)]
*  And so we look at the real interest rate to be a measure of that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=742.98s)]
*  So as you look at the sort of the core inflation rate, whether you say it's two and a half, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=747.46s)]
*  three and a half in that vicinity, let's for simplicity call it three. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=755.26s)]
*  And then what you do is on a real rate basis, you need two, two and a half under normal [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=760.9s)]
*  conditions. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=767.9s)]
*  So that brings you up to the vicinity of a five-ish give or take a little bit in terms [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=768.98s)]
*  of the bonds. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=774.14s)]
*  And then you ease monetary policy when you have a crisis and you have an unemployment. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  So you have a situation where do we have a crisis? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=780.98s)]
*  No, you have stock market making new highs. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=785.98s)]
*  You have the unemployment rate at low levels and you have a chronically high inflation [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  rate relative to the target. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  So under those circumstances, no, I don't think interest rates should come down and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=796.22s)]
*  I think it becomes a bad deal if they come down. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=800.62s)]
*  In addition to that, you have a supply demand issue that's important. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=803.1800000000001s)]
*  Under normal circumstances, what I just described determines the pricing. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=807.42s)]
*  But you also have a supply demand. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to have to sell a lot of bonds because if the government makes a lot of debt, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=815.3399999999999s)]
*  you've got to sell a lot of bonds. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=819.38s)]
*  There's issues in terms of supply demand issues for those bonds. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=821.2199999999999s)]
*  I won't get into, but foreign buyers of those bonds, other people in terms of those bonds. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=826.78s)]
*  So I would say that if I'm looking at the bond rate or if I'm looking at interest rates, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=831.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't like bonds. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=836.38s)]
*  And I think that the risks are more on the upside of rates than they are in the downside of rates. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=837.8199999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=843.5799999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  How do you, one thing that interests me is that a lot of the kind of conventional ways [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=845.5799999999999s)]
*  of thinking about markets have kind of been jostled in the last several years. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=850.8199999999999s)]
*  And one that's prominent right now is gold. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=857.06s)]
*  So real interest rates have been rising, gold is rising. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=860.7s)]
*  What's up with that? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=866.46s)]
*  We have a huge amount of debt and we're creating a huge amount of debt. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=869.86s)]
*  And most likely, there's going to be a monetization of debt. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=873.9000000000001s)]
*  Because if you look at history, when it all comes down to how do you deal with the debt, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=877.62s)]
*  if you pay it back in heart money, that's a deflationary contraction and there's usually [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=881.7800000000001s)]
*  the monetization. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=886.46s)]
*  If you take what's going on with Japan now example, it's a very classic example. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=887.78s)]
*  What they've done is the Bank of Japan has bought a huge amount of bonds, okay? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=892.1s)]
*  And all central banks who have bought these bonds have big losses in these bonds. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=897.9s)]
*  Okay, now there's a dynamic that's underway of they need to have interest rates at a higher [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=901.8199999999999s)]
*  level. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=907.5s)]
*  Why shouldn't their real interest rates be comparable to our real interest rates? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=908.5s)]
*  If that happens, then they're going to have losses in addition to others having losses. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=913.34s)]
*  And when that happens, it makes the bonds less attractive unless you get to that attractive [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=918.88s)]
*  real rate where let's say if they go from a minus 1% to a plus 2% or 3% change in real [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=923.82s)]
*  interest rates, it's a devastating thing. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  So when we look at Japan or we look at other countries right now, we have that dynamic [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=933.88s)]
*  going on. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=939.6600000000001s)]
*  It's a dynamic by the way that we're not used to seeing but has happened repeatedly in history. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=940.78s)]
*  And then if you take the question of what is money and you look at issues of conflict, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=946.4599999999999s)]
*  wars, who can trust what and money, in this environment of great conflict, historically [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=952.66s)]
*  in wars, each country does not want to even lend to the other country because they're [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=959.3s)]
*  worried that if they're lending it, they're going to be paid back in devalued money. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=964.66s)]
*  In that political element, they don't accept even each other's money. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=968.74s)]
*  We're going into that pattern that we may not accept each other's money in different [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=972.74s)]
*  ways. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=977.14s)]
*  So what becomes an alternative money? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=978.14s)]
*  So you could think of gold as almost being the mirror image of the value of those bonds [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=980.42s)]
*  in a sense as an alternative investment. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=985.8s)]
*  It was the core of what money is until and in the cycle. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=988.0600000000001s)]
*  We have the evolution of the cycle. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=994.66s)]
*  It changes. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=997.14s)]
*  But now the question is what kind of money do you have? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=998.38s)]
*  And so it's a safe haven kind of money. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1002.98s)]
*  It's the third largest reserve currency of central banks. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1006.26s)]
*  And getting bigger. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1009.98s)]
*  And getting bigger. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1010.98s)]
*  And so in that sense, gold is sort of a, I'm losing the numbering of your topics, but gold [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1012.0600000000001s)]
*  is sort of like a hedge against number three again. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1020.02s)]
*  It's a great conflict hedge again as opposed to a... [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1023.2s)]
*  It's both conflict and also value of money. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1027.2s)]
*  So if you have a lot of debt, you're going to have to pay it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1032.44s)]
*  And you'll have a choice. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1037.64s)]
*  You'll pay it in hard money or you're going to pay it in soft money. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1038.64s)]
*  And when the central banks get into that position, they play it in soft money. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1041.74s)]
*  So when you look at the perspective situation of just the debt money question and then you [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1045.72s)]
*  overlay that on top of the political situation question, it's a favorable investment. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1050.48s)]
*  And it's not a hot investment in terms of sentiment and so on. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1057.04s)]
*  There's not much talk about gold, which also is a good sign in terms of that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1061.44s)]
*  Now I'm not saying that people... [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1065.88s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying people should run out and get a lot of gold. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  And I don't want to... [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1071.3200000000002s)]
*  You can get it at Costco. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1072.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't want to get... [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1073.3200000000002s)]
*  Can you? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  You can get it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1075.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes, you can. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1077.3200000000002s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  But I am saying that for the reasons I'm describing, it is a diversifier against other aspects [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1080.32s)]
*  of the portfolio. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1090.6s)]
*  If you were to do a portfolio optimization of saying how much would you have in that [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1092.04s)]
*  because of the diversification benefits and so on under normal circumstances without having [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1096.8s)]
*  a view of gold, you would have almost 15% in the portfolio. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it should be that number. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1107.24s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1108.72s)]
*  But if you look at it, I think people are long money and debt, and they're short gold [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1109.88s)]
*  as a percentage of their portfolio. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1117.64s)]
*  And the dynamic is changing. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1120.0s)]
*  It's making new highs. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1121.52s)]
*  So I think it has to be a part, a relatively small part, but it has to be a part of something. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1123.2s)]
*  Can I ask you, continuing on that theme, this is a... [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1129.2s)]
*  We're at the Future of Everything conference. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1132.24s)]
*  Many of the people in the audience here are starting out in their careers and getting [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1135.1s)]
*  going. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1139.7s)]
*  And I was wondering what advice you would have for them if they had $10,000. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1141.1s)]
*  What would you, not Ray Dalio, you after a five-decade career and having made lots and [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1147.7s)]
*  lots and lots more than $10,000, what would you, Ray Dalio, five decades ago in the present [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1152.8999999999999s)]
*  suggest to people here with 10,000? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1160.46s)]
*  Yes, so I would say the first thing that you have to do is think about the purpose of money [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1163.14s)]
*  and that you're saving and immunizing yourself against the purpose of money. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1168.7s)]
*  And what is most valuable of that? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1173.46s)]
*  Almost if you were to think, can I buy... [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1175.52s)]
*  Well, maybe it's buy my apartment or secure my future. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1178.5s)]
*  If I could pre-buy my kids' education, if I could pre-buy those types of things so that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1187.26s)]
*  I can immunize myself, I can hedge myself that I'm going to be good and I'm going to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1192.98s)]
*  be stable. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1198.3799999999999s)]
*  I know when I started working out, when I was in the position you're describing, I said [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1199.3799999999999s)]
*  to myself, how many weeks, months, or years could I live without our money coming in if [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1205.12s)]
*  I should be dropped and I lose my job or something? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1215.58s)]
*  How do I establish that security to basically immunize those types of things? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1220.46s)]
*  So I think that starting out with thinking about the purpose of the money and how you [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1225.46s)]
*  immunize yourself against those things is very, very important. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1230.3s)]
*  Then when you go to higher levels, then you decide how you're going to take risks relative [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1234.3400000000001s)]
*  to that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1238.7s)]
*  So I would say... [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1239.7s)]
*  I'd say if I was to say one headline, it would be first, immunize yourself against those [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1240.7s)]
*  things and secondly, think about your returns in real returns and most importantly, how [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1245.3400000000001s)]
*  you diversify well. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1254.8400000000001s)]
*  The power of diversification, the holy grail of investing that when I discovered it, it [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1256.6000000000001s)]
*  meant everything to me, was can I find, optimally, 15 good uncorrelated return streams because [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1261.9s)]
*  the power of diversification, good diversification means that you can reduce your risks by 80% [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1273.8600000000001s)]
*  without reducing your expected returns and that means you improve your risk-return ratio [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1280.7s)]
*  by a factor of five. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1286.22s)]
*  If you can understand how to diversify well, immunize your liabilities, I think that that's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1288.1s)]
*  the approach that I would take. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1295.22s)]
*  I'd like to take some questions from the audience. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1297.1399999999999s)]
*  If you have a question, please pop your hand up. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1298.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm going to ask Ray one more thing, but then we'll come to questions in the audience. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1300.4199999999998s)]
*  So sticking with that again, how would you think about that question? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1306.3s)]
*  The answer that you gave is something that I think has been universally true for quite [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1314.06s)]
*  a number of years. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1318.74s)]
*  Diversified investments have been something that lots of people have had at the core of [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1319.74s)]
*  thinking about portfolio theory for a long, long time. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1326.06s)]
*  You're describing this new changing world order, things are shifting, the world that [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1329.66s)]
*  will be around in 40 years for people in this room is not going to look like what the world [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  was 40 years ago. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1337.98s)]
*  Does your advice change? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1339.3799999999999s)]
*  Or is it still the same despite the cycles of the... [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1340.98s)]
*  It means it more so. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1344.42s)]
*  It means the uncertainties are going to be great. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1345.58s)]
*  Think about the implications, let's say, AI is going to have on companies, who the winners [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1348.46s)]
*  and the losers are. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1352.76s)]
*  We have a lot more uncertainty about who the winners and losers are. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1354.3s)]
*  If I take any one of these factors, what it does is it creates much more uncertainties [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1357.54s)]
*  and so it makes diversification. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1363.14s)]
*  And then you think about diversification of asset classes, diversification of countries [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1365.02s)]
*  where you're diversified in. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1370.36s)]
*  All of that diversification is going to matter, I think, more, not less. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  There was a question in the back there I saw, but if that person's lost his hand, how about [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1378.32s)]
*  right here in the front? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1382.0s)]
*  Yes, well, the question is... [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1383.0s)]
*  Mic behind you, there you go. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1388.28s)]
*  Things seem to be increasingly correlated and it's harder... [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1389.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1392.84s)]
*  Things seem to be increasingly correlated, so it's harder to find the real diversification. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1394.64s)]
*  Can you mention some assets that are really uncorrelated these days? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1401.0400000000002s)]
*  First of all, correlation is an outcome of the determinants of the pricing. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1407.5200000000002s)]
*  Correlation doesn't intrinsically exist. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1415.5600000000002s)]
*  And if you look at the pricing of asset classes, it makes sense. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1417.8000000000002s)]
*  For example, stocks will go up when growth is faster than discounted and it'll go down [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1422.36s)]
*  if it's less. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1432.36s)]
*  Bonds are the opposite sort of way, generally speaking. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1434.32s)]
*  The way I think of diversification is that there are four main quadrants in that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1437.9599999999998s)]
*  That means inflation rises or declines or growth rises and declines. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1444.6799999999998s)]
*  And if by looking at those and putting those into those four quadrants, I'm trying to then [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1450.44s)]
*  create... [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1454.8400000000001s)]
*  That's the template. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1456.56s)]
*  How diversification changes through time is a function of those drivers. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1457.78s)]
*  And so when I create the diversification, those are the drivers I look at. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1463.04s)]
*  Of course, the tightness of money and the looseness of money raises or lowers all boats [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1467.0s)]
*  or all investments. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  So if you look at the structure of the determination of the correlations, so you have that structural [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1475.52s)]
*  diversification, not just looking at what the recent correlations are, because correlations [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1481.96s)]
*  change over time. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1486.96s)]
*  But the determinants of those correlations don't change or they change very little. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1489.28s)]
*  Because every asset is... [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1495.16s)]
*  Every investment is a lump sum payment for a future cash flow. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1498.32s)]
*  It's true of all investments. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1503.0s)]
*  So when you're looking at it and you say, I'm going to make a lump sum payment, what [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1504.68s)]
*  are the determinants of those future cash flows? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1508.9s)]
*  The determinants are those factors I just mentioned. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NQvY4eK8g&t=1513.0s)]
