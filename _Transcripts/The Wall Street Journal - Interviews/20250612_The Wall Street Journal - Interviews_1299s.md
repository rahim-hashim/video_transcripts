**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc)
*  Secretary McMahon, thanks for taking the time with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's start where else with Harvard. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=2.12s)]
*  Is the administration trying to make an example of Harvard? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=4.32s)]
*  Harvard is clearly one of the most prestigious universities [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=9.92s)]
*  And some of the things we were trying [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=10.94s)]
*  to do relative to preventing anti-Semitism on campuses, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  which is something the president campaigned on, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=16.84s)]
*  we started really with Columbia, not Harvard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=18.96s)]
*  Columbia had been very much in the news. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  The demonstrations that we were seeing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=24.52s)]
*  and the people that we talked to at Columbia [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=26.2s)]
*  were really expressing views to, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=28.52s)]
*  and I talked to some personally, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=30.68s)]
*  I even talked to a student who said that no, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=32.96s)]
*  that she was afraid on campus. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=35.72s)]
*  So we actually did start with Columbia. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=37.94s)]
*  I met with Katrina Armstrong, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=40.36s)]
*  who was then the acting president, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=42.24s)]
*  actually met with her at Columbia [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=44.72s)]
*  and talked about what measures they were putting in place. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  And pretty much not simultaneously, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=49.32s)]
*  but shortly thereafter, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=51.92s)]
*  had the conversation with Alan Garber from Harvard. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=53.36s)]
*  So I wouldn't say that Harvard is certainly the example [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=56.48s)]
*  to be setting across the country, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=62.0s)]
*  but I think elite universities [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=64.28s)]
*  that have not followed policies [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=66.58s)]
*  to prevent anti-Semitism on campus, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=69.12s)]
*  and then look at the other issues [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  that we wanted to address at the same time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=73.16s)]
*  So what we are seeing, by virtue of the action [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=75.36s)]
*  that we were taking, are a lot of other universities [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=77.8s)]
*  who are looking at their policies [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=80.0s)]
*  and making sure that they have preventive measures [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=82.24s)]
*  in place so that there isn't this kind of harassment, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=85.48s)]
*  so that students can come and get an education [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=88.68s)]
*  and not feel threatened and be afraid to be there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=91.68s)]
*  Your issues with Harvard and Columbia [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=94.08s)]
*  go beyond anti-Semitism, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=95.76s)]
*  Can you speak to some of those issues? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=97.44s)]
*  Well, sure, and as we started sitting down [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  and talking with the presidents of these universities [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  and looking at the overall plans that we had in place, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=104.56s)]
*  we wanted to make sure, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  in terms of safety on campuses and what we're going on, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=109.56s)]
*  okay, let's look a little bit broader. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=112.16s)]
*  Let's take a look at what their hiring practices are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=114.12s)]
*  for a lot of the professors that they're bringing in, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=117.56s)]
*  especially from outside of the country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=119.64s)]
*  Let's look at the students that are coming on board, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  and are they properly vetting those students [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=123.68s)]
*  to make sure that there aren't activists [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  or those who even might have had terrorist backgrounds? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=128.52s)]
*  Are we doing that well enough? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  We also looked at the Section 117 requirements [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=133.56s)]
*  of universities to report how much money they're getting [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=138.08s)]
*  and where that money is coming from, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  and that was not in place either. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=144.56s)]
*  So, but we, you know, we've talked about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=146.6s)]
*  a lot of those things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=149.52s)]
*  But what legal authority do you have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=150.44s)]
*  to stop activists from campus? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=152.08s)]
*  Because some might hear activists [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=154.2s)]
*  and also hear free speech. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=155.68s)]
*  Well, I used activists as an example, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=158.32s)]
*  but as we're looking at doing a lot of vetting, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=160.72s)]
*  the very day last week that I was having my testimony, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  before the Senate Education Workforce Committee, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=169.28s)]
*  that morning, they discovered the research scientists [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=173.28s)]
*  at the University of Michigan who came over [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  with those fungus spores to actually introduce into our, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=180.92s)]
*  potentially into our agricultural products. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=186.04s)]
*  So part of what we were saying with the vetting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=188.92s)]
*  is looking at these students and people who are coming in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  to make sure we're trying as best as possible [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  to check their backgrounds, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=198.48s)]
*  and are we doing a thorough enough job [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=199.64s)]
*  before those people do come on our campuses. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=201.76s)]
*  So there was a letter sent to Harvard [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=204.24s)]
*  by the Department of Education, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=205.88s)]
*  I think it was May 5th, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=207.32s)]
*  where it used some pretty combative language. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=208.64s)]
*  It criticized Harvard for hiring Bill de Blasio, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=210.6s)]
*  the former New York City mayor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=213.32s)]
*  Who wrote that letter? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=215.16s)]
*  Well, there was a combination of people who wrote that letter, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=217.64s)]
*  as normally happens with a dear colleague letter [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=220.0s)]
*  or a letter directly like that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=222.96s)]
*  It is clear through the White House, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=224.16s)]
*  it is clear through other agencies, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=225.88s)]
*  and so we try to have a unified effort with that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=227.56s)]
*  I guess the reason I asked is, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  it kind of sounded like President Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  He wrote, or the letter included grants and all caps. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  Was he involved in writing that letter? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  I think you would have even heard, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  I had heard the president use the language [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=241.88s)]
*  about hiring Bill de Blasio, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=244.4s)]
*  because as a city management courses, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  and he said, I don't think there's a worst example. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  So that made it into the letter. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  So was the president involved in drafting the letter? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=255.92s)]
*  President always, not always. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=258.32s)]
*  The president does read some of the correspondence like that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=259.88s)]
*  or maybe bits and pieces of it, or offer his suggestions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=262.32s)]
*  I guess why, like why was, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=265.84s)]
*  whether you like Bill de Blasio or not, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  like why was he mentioned in the letter? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=269.56s)]
*  Does Harvard not have a right to hire a mayor [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=271.32s)]
*  that you all don't like? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=274.2s)]
*  I think Harvard, yes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Harvard does have a right to do that, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=277.0s)]
*  but I think it was pointing out a little bit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=278.64s)]
*  Where is your judgment? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=280.88s)]
*  You know, where is your judgment in who you're hiring? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=282.84s)]
*  Who are you bringing on campus? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=286.68s)]
*  What is your value system, you know, relative to that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  And it was a, you know, it's a bit of a tweak, for sure. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  Madam Secretary, you brought up Columbia earlier. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=295.2s)]
*  They've taken a number of steps [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=298.36s)]
*  to meet some of the demands of the administration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=300.36s)]
*  Why are they still being targeted? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=304.2s)]
*  And is it fair to say that their accreditation is at risk? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=306.48s)]
*  Well, we are sitting down with Columbia. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=310.16s)]
*  I think we've had really good conversations back and forth. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=313.4s)]
*  And now I've had two phone conversations [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=316.32s)]
*  with current president, and she came here and we met, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=321.44s)]
*  and had really good conversation with her. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=326.08s)]
*  And they really do want to make sure [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=328.44s)]
*  that they have the right policies in place. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think we've made really good strides. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=332.12s)]
*  We, you know, the letter to the creditor was simply to say, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  okay, we are pointing out all of the things [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  that universities must be aware of. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=342.36s)]
*  And if they are in violation of federal law, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=344.44s)]
*  then that needs to be on our part. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=347.48s)]
*  If the creditor is not aware, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=349.96s)]
*  we need to make sure the creditor is aware [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  so they're following and doing their job as well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=353.48s)]
*  So what specifically do you want to see Columbia do [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=355.56s)]
*  to meet some of these issues? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=358.28s)]
*  Well, I think we're moving in the right direction. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  They are taking those steps and we're there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=363.4s)]
*  You know, we want to have a whole approach with them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=366.36s)]
*  And I think we're pretty close to that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=369.08s)]
*  Just on the research and development front, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=371.28s)]
*  you know, universities, elite universities, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=373.08s)]
*  like the ones you've described, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=375.44s)]
*  have often been at the forefront of providing the research [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=376.44s)]
*  that drives the American economy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=380.2s)]
*  Do you worry that the research capacity [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=382.64s)]
*  of these universities will be compromised [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=387.2s)]
*  and then it will have an impact on our economy? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  I do think there's so much good research [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=392.08s)]
*  that is done at universities. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, and NIH made, you know, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  their determination of what funding [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=398.12s)]
*  that they were going to withhold, you know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=400.88s)]
*  from Harvard that wasn't us. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=403.2s)]
*  But we do want to see the research continue. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=405.44s)]
*  I just think Harvard, though, didn't say it directly to me. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  I did hear that they might use some of their endowment [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=412.88s)]
*  so that there wasn't any gap in this timing, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=416.0s)]
*  you know, with the research. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=418.0s)]
*  I think the research is important. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=419.36s)]
*  And I hope it will be able to continue. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=421.76s)]
*  I met earlier, just a few minutes ago, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  with the president of MIT. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=426.84s)]
*  And she was stressing with me, you know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=428.64s)]
*  the value of the research they were doing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  And so I think that's important, you know, for all of us. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=433.0s)]
*  Tell me more about this meeting with MIT [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=435.96s)]
*  and just do you think for the schools that are on the list [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  that are not Harvard and Columbia, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=441.52s)]
*  does Harvard and Columbia essentially set the template [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=443.55999999999995s)]
*  potentially for these other schools like MIT, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=447.64s)]
*  like the, you know, the 58 others on the list? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=451.08s)]
*  Well, I think the template really comes [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=453.88s)]
*  from what the president, you know, really wanted to see [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  when he looked at, and first of all, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=459.72s)]
*  it really was triggered by antisemitism [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  and the steps that these universities were not taking [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=466.24s)]
*  to combat that and making children or students [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  be safe on campuses and making parents understand [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=471.64000000000004s)]
*  what they send their students and children to school [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  that they can be in a safe environment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=476.48s)]
*  So what we looked at was, you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  are there policies in place [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=480.12s)]
*  and are the universities enforcing those policies? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=481.44000000000005s)]
*  So I think that is what drives, you know, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=484.0s)]
*  the template for all universities. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=486.48s)]
*  They're common sense things. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=488.24s)]
*  They're things like, yes, have peaceful protest, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=489.72s)]
*  but there is a time and a place appropriate to do that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=491.96s)]
*  There are consequences for operating outside [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=495.68s)]
*  of time and place appropriateness [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=498.04s)]
*  and those actions then have a chilling effect [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=500.08s)]
*  or eliminate that inappropriate behavior. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=503.44s)]
*  And we've been told that there are schools [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=506.4s)]
*  like Northwestern in Chicago that have had their funding, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=508.12s)]
*  some of their funding frozen [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=511.68s)]
*  and they've simply learned about it through the media. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=513.88s)]
*  Is there more that schools like Northwestern need to do [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=516.2s)]
*  in order to have their funding restored? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=519.6s)]
*  I also met with the president of Northwestern. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  He came here and it was a very good meeting [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=524.32s)]
*  and we are now talking more to the other universities. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=527.48s)]
*  You know, it's our goal to get these policies in place [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=531.08s)]
*  and to make sure that there isn't any more funding, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=535.4s)]
*  however freezing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  But I mean, the president was really very clear. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=539.4s)]
*  When universities weren't putting teeth [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=543.0s)]
*  into their own policy and enforcing it, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=545.0s)]
*  we took measures to bring it to their attention [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=547.36s)]
*  and I believe what we're seeing now is that effectiveness. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=549.56s)]
*  So that's hopefully the goal. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=553.52s)]
*  Do you see any potential compromise with Harvard [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=555.8s)]
*  or will this ultimately just be settled by the courts? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope there's a compromise, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=560.68s)]
*  you know, with Harvard. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=562.28s)]
*  I continually say Harvard. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=564.0s)]
*  What could the compromise look like? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=565.8s)]
*  Because you all have set out demands [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=567.24s)]
*  that they've said no to and so like, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=568.84s)]
*  what are the outlines of a potential compromise? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=570.72s)]
*  Well, isn't that the way a compromise always works? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  Right, so what is it? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=575.36s)]
*  Each side sets out its demands, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=576.2s)]
*  so we'll keep you informed as they get closer. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=577.48s)]
*  Any hints about like where you might move [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=579.52s)]
*  or where Harvard might move to try to meet in the middle? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=582.0s)]
*  We've actually started. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  And I think the original demands about anti-Semitism, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=586.52s)]
*  they've already replaced the head [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  of their Middle East studies. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=592.12s)]
*  And so they're doing some things [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=593.76s)]
*  and we'll get to the right answer. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  I think if there's a compromise to be made, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=599.68s)]
*  part of their lawsuit was really starting [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=600.84s)]
*  that this was infringement on First Amendment rights. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=603.04s)]
*  We're very clear, this is not a First Amendment right. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=605.92s)]
*  I firmly believe that on campuses, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=608.36s)]
*  there should be the right to peaceful protest [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=610.64s)]
*  and open debate and discussion of ideas. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=613.4s)]
*  I think that's what university's about, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  but not when it becomes violent. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=617.4s)]
*  And that is a Title VI violation and that's against the law. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=619.6s)]
*  Have you met with a Harvard president yet? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  I've not met with him, but I've talked to him on the phone. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=625.28s)]
*  When? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=627.76s)]
*  Early on at the beginning of things. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=628.6s)]
*  But not recently? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=629.88s)]
*  Not recently, no. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=631.2s)]
*  We've talked to folks on the Hill about the idea [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=633.16s)]
*  of closing the Education Department. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=635.2s)]
*  We can't find anyone who thinks [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=637.04s)]
*  that Congress is going along with it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=638.28s)]
*  So you recognize right that it's very unlikely [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=639.88s)]
*  that Congress is going to agree [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=642.16s)]
*  to close the Education Department right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=643.6s)]
*  Well I recognize that clearly it takes Congressional Act [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=645.24s)]
*  to close the Department of Education. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=648.12s)]
*  But let's be mindful of this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=650.16s)]
*  I think one of the things that I have talked to Congress [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=651.6s)]
*  about is during my confirmation hearing, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=654.52s)]
*  I said the president's goal is obviously not to get rid [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=656.32s)]
*  of education and all of the programs that education has, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  but they can function through different agencies. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=663.2s)]
*  You know IDEA and Title IA were in place [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=665.48s)]
*  long before there was a Department of Education [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=669.24s)]
*  and they could clearly continue. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=671.32s)]
*  Competitive grants, many of those that have to do [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=673.08s)]
*  with workforce development could certainly be handled [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=675.6400000000001s)]
*  by labor, so let's take a look at really [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=677.5600000000001s)]
*  what does the Department of Education do? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  We don't educate anybody. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=682.08s)]
*  We don't set curriculum. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=684.48s)]
*  We don't hire teachers. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=686.36s)]
*  We don't buy books. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=687.72s)]
*  We don't do any of that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=688.76s)]
*  And I believe that there is certainly some room [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=690.72s)]
*  to consider where these programs could reside [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=694.88s)]
*  and how they could continue. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=699.04s)]
*  And my commitment to Congress was working with them [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=700.16s)]
*  to show them where they could reside [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=704.16s)]
*  and how they could be effective [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  and that's what I would like to do to earn their vote [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=708.0s)]
*  to understand how we could have savings [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=710.76s)]
*  and eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=713.84s)]
*  of the Department of Education [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=715.64s)]
*  and better serve students and better serve families. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=716.92s)]
*  How are you implementing the president's executive order [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=720.2s)]
*  about closing the department without Congress right now? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  Well at this particular point we're enjoined [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=726.68s)]
*  because the court has said you cannot proceed with that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=729.4s)]
*  so we're still in the planning stage. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=732.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=734.0s)]
*  You know we're not actively taking any effort, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=734.84s)]
*  but you know as we have had, I've had conversations, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=737.44s)]
*  I mean in the president's executive order [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=741.44s)]
*  one of the things that he asked us to do [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=743.24s)]
*  relative to workforce development et cetera [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=744.96s)]
*  was to talk to commerce, talk to labor. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that makes incredible sense. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=749.1600000000001s)]
*  I did that when I was at SBA. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean I read- [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=753.44s)]
*  But that would still need Congress right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=754.2800000000001s)]
*  To move other things to different cabinets right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=755.5200000000001s)]
*  Well to actually move yes, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=759.1600000000001s)]
*  but to talk about how to go about doing it, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=760.84s)]
*  what we would need to do and how more effective it could be [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  I think is prudent planning. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=766.44s)]
*  How many civil rights complaints are currently pending [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=767.96s)]
*  before the education department, do you know? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  Wow, I didn't know that answer. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=772.2s)]
*  I'd like to get back to you with the exact number. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=774.5s)]
*  I think the number I've heard is 25,000. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=776.0s)]
*  Does that sound about right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=778.24s)]
*  You know what I'd like to confirm with you? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=779.44s)]
*  How are you going to make progress [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=781.08s)]
*  on this massive backlog of 25,000 [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=782.84s)]
*  with a dramatically reduced staff? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=786.0400000000001s)]
*  Well we are doing it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=788.48s)]
*  We would have called it restructuring [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=789.84s)]
*  on the private workforce and it's painful to do. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=791.96s)]
*  And you look at what functions are doing what. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  How could you combine them? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  Are there different approaches [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=800.88s)]
*  to how you could be effective in what you were doing? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=802.52s)]
*  So part of what happened in the restructuring with OCR [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=805.28s)]
*  was to group a lot of the lawyers in terms of expertise [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=811.52s)]
*  instead of just everybody taking on a workload [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=817.4799999999999s)]
*  of general parameters. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  We found that to be incredibly efficient. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=821.4s)]
*  But some of those outstanding cases were very easy. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=825.28s)]
*  You could do a half a dozen of them in a day [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=830.88s)]
*  because they were complaints about, they were little things [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=832.52s)]
*  and you could really take care of them. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=834.96s)]
*  So it doesn't say they don't have their work [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=836.52s)]
*  cut out for them. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  They do, but it's a group that is working very hard. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=839.4s)]
*  And we also have civil rights that's happening at DOJ [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=841.88s)]
*  and other departments as well. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=844.96s)]
*  You've said you wanted to return education [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=847.52s)]
*  back to the states. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=850.24s)]
*  The states are in the best position [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=852.4s)]
*  to oversee these programs. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=853.72s)]
*  Why then do you target states like Maine [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=855.2s)]
*  over policies that you don't agree with? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=858.32s)]
*  Isn't there an inherent contradiction here? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=861.44s)]
*  Well, in Maine, it's a Title IX issue. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=864.64s)]
*  I mean, they were just clearly in violation of Title IX [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  and said they weren't gonna change. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=872.0400000000001s)]
*  So I mean, you have to respect the law. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=874.08s)]
*  We've been told that California is also of interest [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=876.52s)]
*  to the administration. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=879.52s)]
*  Has there been any discussions about pulling federal funds [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=880.64s)]
*  from California as it pertains to education? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=885.12s)]
*  I think we're looking at all states [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=887.56s)]
*  where we see violations that are there. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=889.36s)]
*  If it's against the law, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=892.4399999999999s)]
*  then we're gonna make sure the law is enforced. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  But there are a lot of things that we are investigating [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=896.08s)]
*  and looking into at this point, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  whether it's K through 12 or whether it's higher education, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=901.04s)]
*  I think that's our responsibility at this stage. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=903.3199999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily mean returning education [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=907.3199999999999s)]
*  to the states if you are going to aggressively [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=909.88s)]
*  enforce civil rights law in certain ways [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=913.12s)]
*  that folks disagree with. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, Maine and California, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=918.04s)]
*  they don't necessarily feel that education [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=919.72s)]
*  is being returned to the states. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=922.16s)]
*  They feel like actually there's more federal control. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=923.28s)]
*  Why is that wrong? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=925.76s)]
*  Well, education being returned to the states, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=927.4s)]
*  I think as the president has defined it, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=929.6s)]
*  he does believe that the best education [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=932.0s)]
*  is that that's closest to the child. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=934.24s)]
*  So who better to determine how to direct funding [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=936.6s)]
*  than those superintendents that are on the ground? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=942.0s)]
*  How better to understand what the needs are [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=944.2s)]
*  relative to students with special needs? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=946.84s)]
*  Who better to determine where they want their child [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=949.88s)]
*  to go to school than parents [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=952.48s)]
*  who are looking at the curriculum of those states? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=953.84s)]
*  So those are the driving forces [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=955.96s)]
*  that the president is really re-emphasizing [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=957.76s)]
*  about returning an education to the states. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=959.8000000000001s)]
*  At this point, the federal government really, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  as you know, because of all the research you're doing, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=965.0799999999999s)]
*  you know more of this than I do, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=967.4s)]
*  that the federal government provides 8% to 10% [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=969.68s)]
*  of the total education budget to states. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=973.76s)]
*  But if we were able to get rid of a lot of this bureaucracy [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=976.24s)]
*  that's in between, then more of that money, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=979.88s)]
*  I think, would be available to go to the states [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=982.4399999999999s)]
*  and I think can be better spent by the states [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=984.48s)]
*  and hopefully more of that money would get to the child. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=987.1999999999999s)]
*  But you're using that 8% to 10% leveraging it [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=989.8399999999999s)]
*  to get blue states to change their policies [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=992.8s)]
*  in ways that you prefer, right? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=995.68s)]
*  That's the goal of targeting Maine, for instance, right? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=997.8s)]
*  I don't think Title IX violation [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1001.4799999999999s)]
*  is just getting them on board with our thinking. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1004.3599999999999s)]
*  There's debates among lawyers [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  about how to interpret Title IX. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1009.16s)]
*  But let's move on. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1010.64s)]
*  Not according to the Supreme Court. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1011.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure the Supreme Court has fully settled on that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1014.4799999999999s)]
*  The district court, I'm sorry. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1016.92s)]
*  The Supreme Court has not fully weighed in on that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1018.28s)]
*  The district court who overturned the way [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1020.12s)]
*  that the Biden administration looked at it, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1021.56s)]
*  which then put it back to the way it had been defined before, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1023.56s)]
*  which were men and women. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1026.76s)]
*  Let's do a lightning round if you're up for it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1028.92s)]
*  Hopefully relatively. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1031.96s)]
*  Well, give me a shot if I don't like it, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1032.8s)]
*  I'll just shut it down. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  How's that? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1034.48s)]
*  There was some discussion on the internet [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1035.3s)]
*  when you seemed to confuse A1 and AI. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1039.72s)]
*  I'd love for you to just briefly speak to what happened there. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, that was so funny. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1046.12s)]
*  I was at a, and it was embarrassing. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1046.96s)]
*  I was at a robotic competition. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1049.52s)]
*  And I mean, I'd been touring all day [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1052.9199999999998s)]
*  and we'd been talking about AI every place we went. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1055.72s)]
*  And I'd been speaking about AI, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  how great it was going to be, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1060.48s)]
*  being introduced more and more into education systems. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1062.1599999999999s)]
*  And I was in this big room [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1064.6799999999998s)]
*  and across the whole back of the room was AI. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1066.4399999999998s)]
*  But the eye looked like a one. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1069.8s)]
*  And I just glanced up and said A1. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1071.8s)]
*  And of course then that just made national news. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1074.56s)]
*  I actually, you might find this very amusing. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1077.08s)]
*  It was actually received a little box [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1080.0s)]
*  with two bottles of A1 Stakes. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1081.48s)]
*  Kind of them. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1083.0s)]
*  But it was just a slip of the tongue. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1084.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't think I've said it since, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1086.52s)]
*  though it's been brought up to me many times. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1088.0s)]
*  And my grandchildren said, Gaga, I mean, really? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1089.74s)]
*  During the transition, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1095.28s)]
*  did you initially want to be commerce secretary? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1096.1999999999998s)]
*  The president had talked to me about many places [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  where he thought that I might be able to serve. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1103.72s)]
*  And I thought commerce was one. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1108.2s)]
*  When he talked to me about education, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1110.92s)]
*  one of the things I said to him was, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1113.0s)]
*  I don't come from the world of education. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1114.72s)]
*  So is that absolutely the right fit? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1117.52s)]
*  He said, I don't want someone from the world of education. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1120.02s)]
*  I really, my goals with the Department of Education, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1123.68s)]
*  to have leadership, to have executive ability, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1128.48s)]
*  because I really do want to shut it down [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1130.56s)]
*  and I want someone with management expertise to do that. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1132.7s)]
*  However, he did know that I had gotten my degree to teach [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1135.82s)]
*  when I majored in French in college. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1141.5800000000002s)]
*  I had served on the State Board of Education in Connecticut. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1143.54s)]
*  So, and I've been on the Board of Trustees [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1147.22s)]
*  for Sacred Heart University for about 16 years. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1149.3400000000001s)]
*  So I didn't come without any education background. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1151.5800000000002s)]
*  This is a follow-up from a congressional hearing, I believe. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1154.9s)]
*  Do you think a teacher teaching [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1157.6200000000001s)]
*  about the Tulsa race massacre could count as illegal DEI? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1159.54s)]
*  Do you know, that was asked of me before, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1163.74s)]
*  and I have not delved into that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1165.3799999999999s)]
*  and looked at it since that question, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1169.78s)]
*  and I would like to get back to you on that. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1171.6599999999999s)]
*  But how could that be illegal DEI? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1173.58s)]
*  I mean, that just seems like history. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1175.46s)]
*  So I was asked, let me see if this piggybacks onto that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1177.3s)]
*  So then follow-up questions were like, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1181.1599999999999s)]
*  do you think teaching black history [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1183.06s)]
*  or teaching Asian history of all that, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1185.34s)]
*  I've said, no, clearly that's not DEI. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1187.06s)]
*  That is history, and we should learn about that, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1189.74s)]
*  but we should learn about all aspects of it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1191.1000000000001s)]
*  But the Tulsa race massacre, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1193.24s)]
*  you're not sure if that would constitute as illegal DEI? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1194.64s)]
*  It is just not something I've looked into [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1198.74s)]
*  to the exact case, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1201.68s)]
*  and so I'd really like to brief myself on it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1203.22s)]
*  Is DOJ still working at the U.S. Department of Education? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1206.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, we do have DOJ members here, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1209.9s)]
*  and they are employees of the department. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1211.9s)]
*  They've been onboarded as government employee. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1214.42s)]
*  They abide by all of the rules [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1216.5600000000002s)]
*  and the restrictions of government employee. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1218.76s)]
*  Do you consider charter schools public or private entities? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1220.4s)]
*  I think they are public schools. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1223.3400000000001s)]
*  Every charter school that I have dealt with [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  has been that public-private partnership. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1227.64s)]
*  How often do you speak to the president? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1229.92s)]
*  Oh, probably, it could vary. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1231.72s)]
*  I could talk to him two or three times in one week, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1234.98s)]
*  and then it could be two or three weeks go by, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1236.8200000000002s)]
*  and I don't talk to him at all. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1238.48s)]
*  It depends on if he needs to talk to me, he calls. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1240.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you think children who are unauthorized immigrants [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1244.1000000000001s)]
*  have a right to a free public education? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1247.32s)]
*  Well, isn't that the law now? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1249.76s)]
*  It is, yeah, that's a by-law veto. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1251.52s)]
*  So when those students show up at school, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1253.56s)]
*  they become part of the school system, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1255.54s)]
*  and they are taught. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1257.34s)]
*  Got it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1258.34s)]
*  Last one on the president. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1259.74s)]
*  You first met him, I believe, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1261.04s)]
*  at a Rolling Stones concert in the early 80s. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1262.84s)]
*  What is your relationship like with him, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1265.8s)]
*  and do you think he should seek a third term if he so desires? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1267.98s)]
*  Well, I'm not even gonna address that. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1272.32s)]
*  We know what the laws of land are. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1273.72s)]
*  And I didn't meet him at a Rolling Stones concert. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1276.04s)]
*  He was actually a fan of WWE. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  So he'd been at a couple of events at Madison Square Garden, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1282.78s)]
*  and he invited my husband and me [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1285.26s)]
*  to go to a Rolling Stones concert, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1286.58s)]
*  and so we did, and we had a very enjoyable time with him there. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1289.06s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1292.86s)]
*  Great. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXhMH2P3EBc&t=1294.02s)]
