# U.K. Treasury Chief on Pro-Business Policies and Potential Trump Tariffs | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg)
*  Now, Rachel, I last interviewed you in May last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=0.0s)]
*  The election was two months off. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=5.12s)]
*  You were talking in front of a big room of chief execs and business people who were all [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=6.86s)]
*  incredibly excited and enthused about your pro-business message, the sort of pro-business [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=11.38s)]
*  stance that you were taking there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=17.12s)]
*  We're now six months on from that election, and I think it's no exaggeration to say that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=19.2s)]
*  there's profound disappointment in the business community by some of the decisions that you've [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=22.66s)]
*  taken and also some of the decisions that you haven't taken. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=28.02s)]
*  And it's a feeling that can be summed up by a quote from a business person that was given [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=31.66s)]
*  to my colleague James McIntosh. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  And this business person said, we were very hopeful with the pro-business signaling that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  came in the early days of this new government, but you can't say you're pro-business and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=43.14s)]
*  just think the words matter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=47.42s)]
*  You have to follow through with something that's pro-business and the budget just wasn't. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  It's a stark contrast to the US, and that contrast is only going to get sharper. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=53.74s)]
*  So my opening question to you is, when are you going to start walking the walk and not [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=58.42s)]
*  just talking the talk about being pro-business? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=62.74s)]
*  Well, I think if you look at some of the things we've been saying just in the last few days, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=65.38s)]
*  people can see that this is a proudly pro-business government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=72.26s)]
*  Just this week, we've announced changes to some of our regulatory framework. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  The chair of the Competition and Markets Authority has left, recognizing that this government [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=82.34s)]
*  want the regulators to take a more pro-growth attitude, to lean into growth rather than [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=87.94s)]
*  just regulating for risk. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=93.62s)]
*  The reforms we're making to the planning system to make it easier to build in Britain. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  The reforms we're making to capital markets, particularly to the pensions system to unlock [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=101.98s)]
*  capital to help businesses to grow and eventually to list in the London market. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=108.82s)]
*  But let me take head on the challenge around my budget in October. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=115.22s)]
*  It wasn't necessarily the budget that I wanted to deliver as chancellor, but when I entered [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=122.78s)]
*  office in July last year, I faced a situation where there was a Â£22 billion gap between [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  what the previous government was spending and what they had budgeted for. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=134.7s)]
*  I had to make difficult decisions very early on, some in the first month of government [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  and some in the budget in October, to put our public finances on a firm footing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=145.33999999999997s)]
*  I would just say, I take that criticism, I hear that criticism, but what I haven't heard [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=151.5s)]
*  is any serious alternative to doing what I had to do in October. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=156.98s)]
*  If I hadn't have stabilised the public finances, we would be in a position like previous Conservatives [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=162.94s)]
*  governments have got in the last few years, where the public finances have been clearly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=169.02s)]
*  unsustainable and therefore there's been a lot of market pressure and turbulence in the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=174.34s)]
*  UK. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=180.42s)]
*  Or we would have been in a position where businesses would have known, I needed to come [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=181.42s)]
*  back with more tax increases the next year and uncertainty would have pervaded over the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=184.9s)]
*  UK economy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=190.66s)]
*  So I'm not going to apologise for putting our public finances on a firm footing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=192.02s)]
*  That was the right thing to do, because stability is absolutely non-negotiable, both from an [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  economic stability perspective, but also from a business perspective, because businesses [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=203.38s)]
*  need that bedrock of stability to invest. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=207.96s)]
*  So it was the budget that was necessary, but beyond that budget, whether it is planning [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=210.86s)]
*  reform, regulatory reform, capital markets reform, this is a pro-business government [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=215.74s)]
*  listening to business, removing those barriers that have stopped businesses from investing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=221.32s)]
*  in Britain for too long. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=225.34s)]
*  Okay, so we'll come back to the budget in a bit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=226.48s)]
*  On the issue of regulation, I think a lot of business people find it slightly odd that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=229.28s)]
*  you're talking to regulators about how to generate growth. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=232.68s)]
*  Surely you should be talking to business about how to, it seems counterintuitive to ask the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=235.72s)]
*  regulators when they're there, almost to stop growth. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=240.36s)]
*  Well of course we're talking to businesses about how to improve things. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=243.68s)]
*  I don't think any businesses would say differently. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=248.8s)]
*  If you look at the changes that the Competition and Markets Authority this week, that's been [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=253.36s)]
*  widely welcomed by government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=258.68s)]
*  Also look at some of the changes that the Financial Conduct Authority have put forward [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=261.6s)]
*  in their suggestions to government about making it easier to lend in the mortgage market, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=266.92s)]
*  for example. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=272.6s)]
*  Look at the changes that the Bank of England announced just last week about delaying the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=273.8s)]
*  implementation of Basel III. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=278.68s)]
*  Those are things that have come direct from regulators because of the steer from this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=282.06s)]
*  government that we want them to regulate for growth, not just regulate for risk. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=285.88s)]
*  So some of the regulators are stepping up to the plate, recognising that the number [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=291.72s)]
*  one mission of this new government is to grow the economy and they want to be part of that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=295.54s)]
*  programme. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  And if regulators don't want to be part of that programme, then we will make further [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  changes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=305.04s)]
*  Okay, so I want to talk about innovation because obviously for a successful economy to grow [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  you need innovation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  But one of the, I'm being very specific here, but one of the issues that I hear, for example, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=315.32s)]
*  is that early stage tech start-ups in the UK, they have to comply with regulations like [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  mandatory workplace pensions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  Now it seems to me that somebody joining a tech start-up, the last thing on their mind [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=328.36s)]
*  is I need to make sure I sort out my pension requirements. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  They're thinking how are we going to innovate, how are we going to get investors, how much [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=334.76s)]
*  money can I make before I move on to my next start-up? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=338.48s)]
*  And yet these workplace requirements act as a burden on these sort of innovative tech [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=342.08s)]
*  start-ups, or any start-ups for that matter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  So why not make a sort of grand gesture and remove some of these regulatory burdens on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  these small companies to allow them to sort of move faster? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  It's about 10 years or so since the UK government made changes around automatic enrollment into [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  pensions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=365.84s)]
*  Actually, I would say it was one of the best examples of cross-party support in the UK [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=366.84s)]
*  for a change that has increased people's savings for retirement and has also increased the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=374.28s)]
*  pool of money available to help grow the economy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=380.96s)]
*  So 11 million more people are now saving for retirement who weren't previously because [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=384.64s)]
*  of automatic enrollment. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=389.44s)]
*  Now people can opt out, so you're automatically enrolled, but if you choose to opt out, you [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=390.44s)]
*  can. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=395.68s)]
*  So there's no compulsion on people saving into those retirement funds. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=396.68s)]
*  So if those innovators and those employees say, oh, actually, I don't want to be part [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=401.08s)]
*  of that scheme, that's totally up to them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=406.26s)]
*  I think it's more the burden that's on the employer, because if you're a small start-up, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=410.08s)]
*  you don't have money to have an HR director. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=413.4s)]
*  So it falls often on the founder, him or herself, to sort of sort these things out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=415.28s)]
*  I think that's really in the UK pretty easy to set up an automatically enrolled pension. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=420.0s)]
*  All of the big pension providers provide them. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=426.52s)]
*  Nest, the government-backed scheme provides them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=429.52s)]
*  And as I say, people don't have to participate if they don't want to. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=435.08s)]
*  If they want to take a risk and go and work for a start-up, they don't have to take part [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=439.88s)]
*  in those pension schemes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=443.4s)]
*  But let me say something more widely about our pensions reform, because the big challenge [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=444.4s)]
*  in our pension system is not that people are saving too much for their retirement. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=448.48s)]
*  That is still a challenge. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=451.68s)]
*  The problem is that money that is being saved for retirement isn't working well enough for [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=453.2s)]
*  savers and it's not working well enough for the UK economy. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=457.52s)]
*  So we've got the second largest assets under management in the world in the UK in our pensions [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=461.4s)]
*  system. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=467.8s)]
*  But less than 5% of that money is invested in UK equities, even less in unlisted venture, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=469.08s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=476.08s)]
*  And so the reforms we're trying to make to our pension system is about consolidating [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  the pension industry, a smaller number of bigger funds that then have the economies [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=482.2s)]
*  of scale to invest more wisely in things that deliver better returns for savers, but crucially [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=487.04s)]
*  help grow the economy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=493.5s)]
*  And this goes to the point of the start-ups you're talking about, because the big challenge [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=494.5s)]
*  that start-ups say to me is not that they have to pay a small amount into pensions, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=498.42s)]
*  but that they're not able to raise money in the UK to scale up their business, to grow [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=503.46s)]
*  it to the size where it can achieve its potential. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=508.9s)]
*  And the pension reforms we're putting in is about changing all of that so that fast-growing [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=511.9s)]
*  businesses in the UK can access finance in the UK, and then hopefully then list and stay [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=517.64s)]
*  in the UK rather than going to America. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=523.26s)]
*  Because one great UK entrepreneur said to me recently that every time his business raises [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=525.78s)]
*  money they become a bit more American, because that is where the money is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=533.16s)]
*  And yet we have got a huge untapped pool of capital in the UK that at the moment is often [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  sitting in cash and government bonds that could be working better for savers and could [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=542.68s)]
*  be working better for our real economy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  So our pensions reforms, we just finished a consultation on it last week, the pensions [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=549.16s)]
*  bill will be coming in the first half of this year, is about radically changing how our [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=554.0s)]
*  pensions industry works. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=559.0s)]
*  And I think that's really exciting for entrepreneurs and meets one of the big challenges that businesses [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=560.68s)]
*  have said to us, that despite the fact that we've got so much, such a big asset management [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=566.04s)]
*  and pension industry in the UK, the sector does not deliver in the way it should for [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=572.68s)]
*  our real economy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=577.28s)]
*  So that leads nicely on to my next question, which is about competitiveness. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=579.14s)]
*  Now I'd say pretty much every single measure the US beats the Europe and the UK on competitiveness. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=583.42s)]
*  And there's a consensus on the continent now that much of that derives from regulation [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=592.9399999999999s)]
*  that comes out of Brussels, it's all set out in the Draghi report. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=597.22s)]
*  Now obviously the UK is no longer a member of the EU, and yet you don't seem, but yet [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=600.5s)]
*  so far it doesn't appear to have sort of wanted to make the most of this unique position that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=608.18s)]
*  it's in. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=612.18s)]
*  So my question is why, wouldn't it be an interesting twist of fate or twist of history if it was [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=613.1s)]
*  a Labour government that decided to derive the full benefits of Brexit? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=619.3s)]
*  I mean it's there for the taking, why don't you do that rather than existing in this kind [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=623.66s)]
*  of limbo where you're neither heading back towards Europe in terms of trade, but nor [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=628.2s)]
*  are you diving into the opportunities that not being part of the EU give the UK? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=632.26s)]
*  I think there are opportunities, as you say, to diverge from the European Union in terms [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=637.94s)]
*  of regulations, and I would say there's sort of two spaces in particular where we are doing [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=642.7s)]
*  just that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=650.88s)]
*  First of all is in the area of AI, and the second is the area of financial services. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=652.22s)]
*  So I mentioned the Bank of England delaying the implementation of Basel III that we announced [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=658.34s)]
*  just over a week ago. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=666.22s)]
*  The Europeans haven't announced that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=668.7800000000001s)]
*  I think that gives us a competitive advantage in UK financial services and one that we should [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=671.02s)]
*  use to advantage firms operating out of London and the UK. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=676.02s)]
*  But the second area is in AI where I think the European Union has taken an over-burdensome, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=681.9s)]
*  over-regulatory approach which puts off investment in AI and also means that those economies [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=689.5799999999999s)]
*  miss out on new applications and new ideas and new technologies. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=698.22s)]
*  We don't want to be in that place in Britain. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=703.3s)]
*  We published last Monday, our Prime Minister Keir Starmer published the AI Action Plan, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=705.5s)]
*  and that included a number of really exciting things to make Britain a great place to invest [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=711.78s)]
*  if you're a business in the AI or tech space. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=717.7s)]
*  The first is these AI investment zones. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=721.6600000000001s)]
*  We've set up the first of them in Cullum, just in Oxfordshire, where there is large [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=724.1s)]
*  amounts of excess supply of energy that can then power data centres. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=729.38s)]
*  We're setting these up around the country to bring in that investment in data centres [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=734.5s)]
*  to power the AI revolution. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=738.98s)]
*  The second is around regulation, where our Prime Minister has been really clear that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=743.3s)]
*  he wants to take a much more cautious approach to regulation compared to what the European [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=748.58s)]
*  Union is doing, that we don't regulate to death a fast-growing and exciting sector [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=753.62s)]
*  of the economy. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=759.62s)]
*  So not cautious but more... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=760.62s)]
*  Yes, sorry. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=761.62s)]
*  So a more wait and see. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=762.62s)]
*  So wait to see what the applications are and then regulate, rather than regulate before [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=764.42s)]
*  we even know what the technology is going to do, which seems to be the European approach. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=768.62s)]
*  So we are taking advantage of those opportunities, and proactively so. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=773.42s)]
*  People would have absolutely seen that in the AI Action Plan. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=779.42s)]
*  I have a chance this week, whilst I've been in Davos, to talk to some of the big AI and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=782.38s)]
*  tech companies, particularly US companies. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=788.06s)]
*  The UK is their second home, and I was with Ruth Porat from Google and Julie Sweep from [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=793.3399999999999s)]
*  Accenture yesterday on a panel, and they were saying that our AI Action Plan is best in [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=799.42s)]
*  class and that it is attracting that investment and innovation into the UK economy. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=807.0999999999999s)]
*  And our industrial strategy that we published in draft form just a couple of months ago [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  has AI at the centre of that for three reasons, really. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=817.8599999999999s)]
*  First of all, Britain wants to be a place where we attract firms at the technological [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=822.86s)]
*  frontier, and I was really pleased to be with Demis Hasselpest from Google Deep Mind last [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=826.82s)]
*  night. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=833.1800000000001s)]
*  We want to see greater diffusion of technology and AI through the rest of the economy to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=834.82s)]
*  help that sort of long tail of lower productivity firms really step up. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=839.7800000000001s)]
*  And third, there's a massive potential to use AI better in the delivery of public services, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=845.46s)]
*  to deliver a better service for citizens, but also, and this is attractive for me as [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=852.14s)]
*  Chancellor, managing tight budgets, to take some of the costs out of running government. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=858.1s)]
*  And there are big opportunities, and we're working with some of the big tech firms about [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=862.9s)]
*  how we can exploit those for the UK taxpayer and citizen. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=866.74s)]
*  So you're talking about a light touch regulation around AI, and this sounds great, but at the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=870.58s)]
*  same time, there still seems to be a sort of default towards regulation. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=875.9399999999999s)]
*  So for example, you're pursuing the idea of a football regulator. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=880.38s)]
*  Why regulate one area where the UK is absolutely winning the Premier League? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=884.38s)]
*  It's a huge British success story, but you're talking about a football regulator. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=889.22s)]
*  Isn't that just the wrong approach to be taking? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=893.18s)]
*  It's to help some of our smaller clubs that have really struggled in recent years, and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=896.3s)]
*  are often at the heart of our local communities. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=901.7s)]
*  So there's been a few scandals in the UK where small clubs have been taken over and then [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=904.06s)]
*  been driven to the edge of bankruptcy. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=909.26s)]
*  So that's the problem that we're trying to address there. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=911.02s)]
*  But I hope that people see, from the leadership of our Prime Minister to the work that I'm [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=915.74s)]
*  doing, the announcements just yesterday from our Environment Secretary to allow housing [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=920.7s)]
*  development to go ahead, even when... [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=927.34s)]
*  So we've just created something called a Nature Restoration Fund. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=933.3000000000001s)]
*  So when you make a housing development, instead of having to make it nature neutral in the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=935.9399999999999s)]
*  place you're doing the development, you can pay into a fund where you can have nature-positive [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=939.8199999999999s)]
*  investment somewhere else, but you can get on with the housing and you don't have to [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=944.34s)]
*  make it neutral in the place you're doing the development. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=951.02s)]
*  That's a big change for environmental regulation. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=954.3s)]
*  It was holding back housing development in the UK. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=957.3s)]
*  We just should unlock about 150 sites immediately in the UK where we can get building. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=960.14s)]
*  So look, it may be the case that people look at the UK and think we are overly burdensome [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=966.1s)]
*  in terms of regulation. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=972.22s)]
*  That's changing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=973.38s)]
*  The Prime Minister's made that a key priority, whether it is the changes at the Competition [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=974.58s)]
*  and Markets Authority, the changes I've instigated at the financial regulators, or indeed just [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=979.3s)]
*  some of the changes we made yesterday on environmental reforms. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=985.3s)]
*  And just today, our Prime Minister's announced cutting the number of legal challenges that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=989.7s)]
*  can be brought against new developments to stop the time taken through court cases, judicial [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=995.34s)]
*  reviews holding up developments. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1001.14s)]
*  So the idea that we are big regulators, that is changing under the leadership of this government [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1003.22s)]
*  and this Prime Minister. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1009.18s)]
*  Rachel, I think what you need is a chainsaw. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1010.18s)]
*  You need to get out and make a big bold gesture. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1013.22s)]
*  Do something that captivates people's attention. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1016.38s)]
*  Because what I hear a lot is this real sense of gloom. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1018.58s)]
*  But you're talking as if you're planning to rip up all these regulations and do things. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1021.98s)]
*  Have you thought about trying to deliver the message in a slightly more, dare I say it, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1027.58s)]
*  boosterish kind of way? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1031.74s)]
*  I'll go back to London and buy a chainsaw. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1033.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1039.26s)]
*  We'll look out for that on our TV screens. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1040.3799999999999s)]
*  OK, so on the EU, I think a lot of businesses, again, they're slightly baffled. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1042.3799999999999s)]
*  You've got this big majority. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1048.1s)]
*  You've got five years until the next election. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1049.46s)]
*  If you're worried about upsetting over Europe, you've got four years to forget about it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1051.94s)]
*  Why not make a big bold gesture towards the EU? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1055.1s)]
*  You want growth. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1058.26s)]
*  Growth comes from trade. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1059.78s)]
*  What's holding you back there? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1062.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think you've just, in the previous question, shown that we've got to get the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1063.3799999999999s)]
*  balance right. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1067.78s)]
*  We can take advantage of some of the things from being outside of the European Union by [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1069.5s)]
*  being more flexible and more innovative when it comes to regulation. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1073.58s)]
*  But yeah, there are too many barriers, particularly for small businesses who want to trade and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1079.1s)]
*  export around Europe. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1082.42s)]
*  We want to improve that. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1085.06s)]
*  We've just appointed somebody to lead that work for us in government because we do want [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1086.26s)]
*  to get a better deal. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1094.98s)]
*  It's almost nine years now, Emma, since the British people voted to leave the European [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1096.5s)]
*  Union. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1101.02s)]
*  That is settled. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1102.02s)]
*  What we want to do, though, is improve upon the deal that the previous government secured, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1103.86s)]
*  which is not one that works well enough, either for the UK economy or indeed for the European [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1109.42s)]
*  economy. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1114.58s)]
*  I was talking to the German finance minister last month when I was in Brussels, and he [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1115.58s)]
*  said that the UK used to be the fourth biggest export market for Germany. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1121.34s)]
*  It's now the 12th. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1125.14s)]
*  It's not just that Brexit isn't delivering for the UK. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1126.7800000000002s)]
*  It's also not delivering very well for other European countries who are finding increased [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1130.8200000000002s)]
*  barriers in exporting to consumers in the UK. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1134.66s)]
*  We're looking to make changes to that, particularly in terms of trades in goods. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1138.5400000000002s)]
*  What about the offer that I think the EU Trade Commission talked about yesterday to the BBC [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1143.8600000000001s)]
*  of inviting the UK to join this pan-European customs area? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1149.9s)]
*  It's not the customs union, but it's this wider pan-European customs area. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1155.66s)]
*  Is that something that Labour is going to take up? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1159.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, we're also doing free trade deals around the world. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1160.98s)]
*  We are in negotiations at the moment with the Gulf countries. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1165.5400000000002s)]
*  Some of the fastest growing economies are trade and investment deals. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1170.66s)]
*  I think we've got to strike the right balance. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1175.9s)]
*  We're a government that is re-engaging and resetting relationships with countries around [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1179.14s)]
*  the world. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1184.54s)]
*  I was in China last weekend getting better licenses and quotas for UK financial services [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1185.54s)]
*  companies doing business in China. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1191.54s)]
*  I was the first Chancellor to attend the Eurogroup meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1195.06s)]
*  last month. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1202.06s)]
*  We're looking to do deals with countries around the world. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1203.06s)]
*  I think we've got to get that balance right. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1206.94s)]
*  We're not going back into the European Union, the single market, the customs union, but [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1211.26s)]
*  I think there is a better and more bespoke deal we can get, particularly to make it easier [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1215.5s)]
*  to export goods around Europe. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1220.3s)]
*  Donald Trump recently elected obviously takes a very different approach towards China and [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1224.82s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1228.98s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1229.98s)]
*  Have you got any plans for the UK to erect tariffs if some sort of trade war takes off? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1231.6200000000001s)]
*  Is the UK going to be the only country holding firm on free trade while all around trade [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1238.8999999999999s)]
*  barriers go up? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1246.58s)]
*  Free trade has been good for Britain. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1247.58s)]
*  It keeps prices down for UK consumers, which is incredibly important. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1249.78s)]
*  We've just gone through globally, including in the UK, a massive cost of living crisis. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1254.02s)]
*  Tariffs only put up prices for consumers. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1258.62s)]
*  I think we'd want to be very careful about going down that route. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1261.9399999999998s)]
*  How will you respond though, if the new US administration imposes tariffs on the UK? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1266.94s)]
*  How will you respond? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1274.3400000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about what you could do to retaliate? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1275.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to comment on hypotheticals. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1278.7s)]
*  The challenge that Donald Trump, President Trump is trying to address is countries that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1283.38s)]
*  run persistent large surpluses with the trade surpluses with the US. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1288.22s)]
*  That is not the case for the UK. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1293.62s)]
*  Depending on your measurement, we either run a small deficit or a small surplus with the [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1296.34s)]
*  United States. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1302.78s)]
*  We are not the problem that President Trump is trying to deal with. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1304.26s)]
*  So we will make that case strongly in any future discussions around tariffs. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1309.02s)]
*  But I believe that the UK economy and countries around the world benefit from free trade. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1316.34s)]
*  So I think that trade is a good thing to keep businesses on their toes. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1322.7800000000002s)]
*  And tariff free trade is good for consumers in increasing choice and reducing prices. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1325.7800000000002s)]
*  Part of Donald Trump's fear about China isn't just pure trade. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1332.7800000000002s)]
*  It's that there are national security concerns. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1338.66s)]
*  Do you share those concerns? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1341.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1342.74s)]
*  Absolutely we share those concerns. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1343.74s)]
*  There should be areas where you would want to keep things very separate. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1346.58s)]
*  But when it comes to getting banking licenses for HSBC or Standard Chartered Bank to operate [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1352.4199999999998s)]
*  in China, that's nothing to do with national security. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1359.9399999999998s)]
*  It's common sense. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1363.06s)]
*  And in fact the licenses that I secured for UK listed banks last week in China are licenses [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1364.06s)]
*  that US investment banks already have. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1371.8999999999999s)]
*  The reason the UK doesn't have them is because we haven't engaged with China in an economic [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1374.82s)]
*  and financial dialogue or in any other way for the last few years. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1378.78s)]
*  And as a result it was British businesses that missed out. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1382.7s)]
*  So when it comes to issues that are not about national security, I do think it's important [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1387.1399999999999s)]
*  to engage. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1392.4199999999998s)]
*  I will always act in the UK's national interest. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1393.4199999999998s)]
*  I will always stand up for UK businesses. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1395.86s)]
*  I was pleased to be joined on that delegation by a number of senior UK business leaders [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1398.26s)]
*  and to be able to get a good deal for them, which is a good deal for the UK economy, jobs [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1403.8999999999999s)]
*  and investment in my home country. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1408.26s)]
*  So one of the other things that I've heard a lot in these few days in Davos has been [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1411.3s)]
*  this fear that companies that are listed in London on the London Stock Exchange are going [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1414.86s)]
*  to upstix and go to the US. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1420.1s)]
*  What would you say to a company currently listed in London or that's trying to make [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1421.9799999999998s)]
*  a decision about where to list? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1425.62s)]
*  Why should they stay in London? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1427.3s)]
*  Why not go to the US where clearly the business environment is more favourable? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1428.54s)]
*  This isn't just a UK thing. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1434.5s)]
*  This is for listed companies around the world. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1436.1399999999999s)]
*  You've seen a move, well two moves really. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1439.98s)]
*  First of all delisting and going private and second relisting or dual listing in the US [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1443.1399999999999s)]
*  market. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1449.82s)]
*  One of the reasons why we are looking to make the reforms to capital markets, particularly [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1451.18s)]
*  around the pensions reforms that I've mentioned, is to try and keep more businesses in the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1455.74s)]
*  UK because it's not the decision about where to locate isn't made at the time of listing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1461.46s)]
*  It often happens a lot earlier and if you're raising your capital in the US, you start [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1468.6200000000001s)]
*  drifting towards the US. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1472.58s)]
*  So the capital markets reforms are about trying to keep more businesses during that scale [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1474.1s)]
*  up journey in the UK. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1479.38s)]
*  But in July last year we changed the listing rules in the UK to make it easier for founders [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1481.8999999999999s)]
*  to keep some control over their business, matching, mirroring some of the reforms that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1489.8999999999999s)]
*  have already happened in US markets. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1495.9399999999998s)]
*  Later this year we're going to be introducing intermittent trading in the London Stock Exchange [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1498.74s)]
*  so companies that are not listed can intermittently trade in the market to raise capital in the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1504.22s)]
*  London markets. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1510.22s)]
*  That's something that no stock market in the world does today but will be an innovation [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1511.26s)]
*  you'll be able to use in the UK to help start and scale up businesses to raise finance. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1515.8600000000001s)]
*  So there's lots of exciting things happening under David Schwimmer's leadership at the [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1522.46s)]
*  London Stock Exchange Group which I think gives a pause for thought for companies that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1526.22s)]
*  are thinking about upping sticks and relisting in the US. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1532.42s)]
*  But we know we've got more to do. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1536.02s)]
*  I'm not saying we've done everything we need to do. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1537.6200000000001s)]
*  We've been in government for just six months but we've got started in reforming the planning [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1541.26s)]
*  system, in reforming the regulatory system, reforming our capital markets to make Britain [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1545.98s)]
*  a better place to do business and to invest. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1551.8600000000001s)]
*  We're determined to carry on doing just that so that we can be competitive and ultimately [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1556.7s)]
*  so that we can improve living standards for working families in Britain. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1562.18s)]
*  One other thing I want to talk to you about is energy. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1567.22s)]
*  Energy is very expensive in the UK and you talk about wanting to encourage AI and data [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1569.66s)]
*  centres and electric vehicles. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1575.66s)]
*  How are you going to do that when energy costs are so high? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1577.54s)]
*  Look, it's been a real challenge in Europe the last three years, particularly since Russia's [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1580.38s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1586.74s)]
*  Europe has been hard hit in terms of energy prices by that war. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1588.94s)]
*  It is a reminder that we need to wean ourselves off oil and gas whose prices have gone up [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1595.02s)]
*  so significantly. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1603.26s)]
*  It is why in the UK we are investing heavily in homegrown renewables, primarily to boost [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1604.26s)]
*  our energy security in the UK but also to bring good jobs to Britain. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1611.26s)]
*  So we've ended the moratorium that's existed for more than a decade on building onshore [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1616.9799999999998s)]
*  wind in the UK. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1622.74s)]
*  That's true but you also haven't lifted the moratorium on oil and gas drilling and I wonder [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1623.82s)]
*  whether you've ever considered taking the all of the above energy approach that President [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1628.3s)]
*  Obama, in fact all the US presidents have opted for when it comes to energy policy. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1632.7s)]
*  You've made it easier for one thing but there's another lever you could pull there. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1638.3s)]
*  You know Emma, the North Sea is a rapidly declining basin for extraction of oil and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1643.98s)]
*  gas. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1651.78s)]
*  It's a very mature field. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1652.82s)]
*  We've committed to honour all existing licences including licences that haven't yet started [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1654.82s)]
*  drilling, two or three of those, and all existing licences can be fully exploited. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1660.8999999999999s)]
*  But the big opportunity in the UK is in the area of renewables, particularly new technologies [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1667.34s)]
*  like floating offshore wind, I've already mentioned onshore wind, also big opportunities [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1675.18s)]
*  in carbon capture and storage where we've just embarked on a joint initiative with Equinor [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1681.3000000000002s)]
*  and BP in two projects, one in Teesside and one in Merseyside to capture carbon to support [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1685.9s)]
*  some of our energy intensive industries to support them to continue and investments in [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1693.38s)]
*  areas like blue and green hydrogen. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1699.0200000000002s)]
*  So big opportunities in the UK. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1701.94s)]
*  When we hosted the International Investment Summit in October last year, we managed to [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1704.8200000000002s)]
*  attract Â£63 billion worth of investment into the UK and that was in two key areas. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1710.78s)]
*  First of all AI and second in clean energy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1717.02s)]
*  That shows where the big investment opportunities are in the UK. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1721.46s)]
*  I would just add to that the area of life sciences, three fast growing areas where the [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1725.18s)]
*  UK benefits from real comparative advantages. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1731.3799999999999s)]
*  We've got four of the top universities in the world in the UK. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1734.7s)]
*  We've got great entrepreneurs, great ideas coming out of those universities and as a [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1738.62s)]
*  result lots of investment coming into those sectors. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1743.02s)]
*  So I want to ask as well around the sort of fiscal pressures that the country faces. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1746.8999999999999s)]
*  So borrowing cost rose to some of the highest levels they've seen in years just recently [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1752.7399999999998s)]
*  and at the time you came out and said we're not breaching our fiscal rules. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1755.8999999999999s)]
*  That may seem like a tough line to keep holding and I mean if you find yourself in that predicament [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1759.5s)]
*  and you're coming under pressure, would you look at raising taxes or pulling back on any [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1764.58s)]
*  of the spending commitments that you've made? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1772.02s)]
*  First of all, cost of government borrowing did rise earlier this year. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1775.6999999999998s)]
*  They've fallen back since but that was a global phenomenon. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1780.4199999999998s)]
*  It wasn't something that just hit the UK worse. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1784.82s)]
*  To be honest, our bond yields pretty much tracked what was happening globally and the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1788.98s)]
*  source of the volatility mainly came from uncertainty about what was happening in the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1795.1s)]
*  United States. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1800.74s)]
*  I'm not going to give a sort of running commentary on financial markets but what I have been [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1801.74s)]
*  really clear about is that the fiscal rules and those fiscal rules that are balanced day [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1805.7s)]
*  to day spending with tax receipts and to bring debt down as a share of our GDP, those fiscal [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1810.98s)]
*  rules are non-negotiable. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1817.2199999999998s)]
*  We will meet them. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1819.2199999999998s)]
*  We will continue to meet them. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1820.2199999999998s)]
*  We have some headroom against those fiscal rules in the budget that I set out in October [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1821.6999999999998s)]
*  but if that headroom comes under pressure, we will find ways to ensure that we continue [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1827.8999999999999s)]
*  to meet those fiscal rules. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1833.2199999999998s)]
*  The reason why that's so important and a point of principle for me is that economic [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1834.78s)]
*  instability and fiscal instability has plagued the UK for the last few years. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1840.6599999999999s)]
*  We saw it particularly when the last Conservative government under Liz Truss crashed the economy [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1845.02s)]
*  by playing fast and loose with the public finances. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1850.46s)]
*  I've been really clear when I was shadow Chancellor in the run-up to the election and since that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1853.02s)]
*  I will never play fast and loose with the public finances because when you do so, you [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1858.82s)]
*  play fast and loose with family finances and you make the cost of capital for business [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1864.1s)]
*  higher. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1868.06s)]
*  That uncertainty is bad for families and it's bad for businesses. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1869.66s)]
*  Those fiscal rules are really important to me, really important to this government and [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1873.52s)]
*  we'll continue to meet them. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1878.08s)]
*  We've asked the Office of Budget Responsibility to give an update, economic and fiscal update, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1879.6s)]
*  on March 26. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1886.6s)]
*  I'll set out the measures that are necessary, if they are necessary, to ensure that those [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1889.08s)]
*  fiscal rules are continued to be met. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1894.08s)]
*  And quickly, what's your prediction for inflation? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1895.84s)]
*  I was once an economist at the Bank of England and was involved in those forecasts but not [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1900.12s)]
*  anymore so I will leave that to the independent forecasters. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1904.7199999999998s)]
*  Inflation in the UK, most recent numbers fell from 2.6 to 2.5%. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1908.9599999999998s)]
*  Our target is 2%. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  The Bank of England and others have that inflation, I think, going up a little bit over the next [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1916.7199999999998s)]
*  few months but then falling to 2% over the forecast horizon. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1921.8799999999999s)]
*  So one other thing I wanted to ask you about, there's been an exodus of high net worth individuals [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1928.48s)]
*  from the UK. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1932.76s)]
*  You read about them leaving, they don't want to be there anymore for all sorts of reasons [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1935.2s)]
*  since Labour got elected. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1939.8s)]
*  Does that worry you and are you going to do anything to try and stop that exodus? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1942.04s)]
*  I absolutely want Britain to be a place that encourages the most talented people in the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1946.64s)]
*  world to come and I'll just say a couple of things about that. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1953.0800000000002s)]
*  We announced earlier this week that when we publish the immigration white paper later [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1957.92s)]
*  this year we will consult on looking at visas for the highest skilled people to come in [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1963.48s)]
*  to the UK, particularly in areas like AI and life sciences where I've already mentioned [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1970.16s)]
*  the UK has huge potential because we want to be the place that attracts the most talented [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1974.88s)]
*  people from around the world. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1980.0s)]
*  When it comes to the issue of non-DOMs, the previous government and this government have [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1982.88s)]
*  increased taxes on non-DOMs because we need to raise revenue to fund our public services. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1989.48s)]
*  Debt as a share of GDP is close to 100%, we've been running persistent budget deficits, we [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=1997.8000000000002s)]
*  needed to raise money, we haven't increased corporation tax, corporation tax remains at [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2002.92s)]
*  25%, we haven't increased taxes that working people pay on their incomes but we have increased [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2007.88s)]
*  some taxes on the wealthiest but we have been listening to the concerns that have been raised [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2015.64s)]
*  by the non-DOM community and in the finance bill we will be tabling an amendment which [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2022.6000000000001s)]
*  makes more generous the temporary repatriation facility which enables non-DOMs to bring money [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2028.0s)]
*  without paying significant taxes. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2034.68s)]
*  In addition to that, I would just say there's been some concerns from countries that have [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2038.4s)]
*  double taxation conventions with the UK, including India, that they would be drawn in to be paying [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  inheritance tax. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2050.2000000000003s)]
*  That's not the case, we're not going to be changing those double taxation conventions [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2051.2000000000003s)]
*  and so countries like India, non-DOMs from India, will not be affected by the inheritance [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2056.36s)]
*  tax changes. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2061.32s)]
*  Okay, I want to open things up to the floor for some questions in a second but just quickly [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2062.44s)]
*  before that, there's been a definite vibe shift coming out of the US. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  Some would say, well, many would say it's a much more macho vibe, you're the first female [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2071.44s)]
*  Chancellor of the Exchequer of the UK, do you think you're going to have to sort of [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2076.32s)]
*  match that vibe, bring a bit of what Mark Zuckerberg calls masculine energy to the job? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2079.48s)]
*  Emma, do you think that only men have energy? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2085.2s)]
*  Maybe we should both get chainsaws, yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2092.2s)]
*  Or maybe we should just carry on doing the jobs we're doing and doing them pretty well, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2095.2s)]
*  if I would say. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2098.68s)]
*  Emma, I've got plenty of energy, I've got plenty of ideas, I know what it takes to make [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2100.2799999999997s)]
*  the UK a successful and competitive economy, we're removing the barriers that make it harder [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2107.08s)]
*  for companies to do stuff in Britain, we're going to carry on doing that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2112.7200000000003s)]
*  We're a great economy with huge opportunities, I've been in Davos this week banging the drum [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2117.7200000000003s)]
*  for Britain, asking people to take another look at the UK, we've had stagnant growth [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2123.12s)]
*  for the last decade but that is going to change, this government making the difficult decisions [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2128.48s)]
*  and prioritising the things that are necessary to grow the economy and I look forward to [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2133.92s)]
*  working with him because the relationship between our countries is incredibly important, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2137.84s)]
*  we're big trading partners and I look forward to working with the US administration. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2150.8s)]
*  Great, questions, there's one here. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2155.8s)]
*  Would you mind identifying yourself as well? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2158.8s)]
*  My name's David Hague, I'm from a company called Brand Finance, we're interested in [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2161.8s)]
*  intellectual property and that kind of thing. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  My question actually is about the start-up industry, you're obviously doing some great [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2168.4799999999996s)]
*  stuff with regulation and various different things, I'm sceptical that pension funds and [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2173.08s)]
*  banks are really going to change their ways, it's extremely difficult to get money out [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2179.3199999999997s)]
*  of them for smaller businesses, right up to mid-sized businesses, are you planning to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2182.7999999999997s)]
*  do anything in terms of tax breaks, incentives, whatever, to help that sector? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2187.3599999999997s)]
*  Thanks very much for that question David, you're absolutely right, the pension funds [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2194.36s)]
*  haven't done enough to invest either in listed or unlisted equities in the UK, the pensions [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2200.6400000000003s)]
*  bill will be published in the first half of this year and although the consultation has [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2207.92s)]
*  finished I'm very happy if you've got things that you want to contribute to that, at the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2211.6800000000003s)]
*  moment there are 27,000 defined contribution pension schemes in the UK, the majority have [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2217.92s)]
*  fewer than 100 members, we've got to drive consolidation in that sector and also in the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2223.48s)]
*  local government pension scheme where we're going to move from 86 administering authorities [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  to 8 pools to manage local government pension scheme savings to create some of the sort [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2233.0s)]
*  of mega funds that you see in countries like Canada and Australia to drive better investment [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2238.12s)]
*  decisions and get better returns. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2243.32s)]
*  In terms of what we're doing as a government we've also set up the British Growth Partnership [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  under the British Business Bank to leverage in private sector money to help those start [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  and scale up businesses that you're talking about, we've already had investments from [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2255.08s)]
*  I think it's Aegon and NatWest Cushion into that British Growth Partnership to get that [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2259.12s)]
*  capital to exactly the sort of businesses that you're talking about, we've identified [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2266.48s)]
*  it as a real problem but also as a massive opportunity to help scale up those businesses [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2270.7599999999998s)]
*  and to keep them in Britain as well and I'm determined to do everything that it takes [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  to do that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2279.52s)]
*  I've got another question here. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2280.52s)]
*  Yes, sorry, just because the questions add on to that, I'm one of those companies, I'm [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2281.8399999999997s)]
*  a British entrepreneur, my last startup was launched by your Stammers predecessor, Theresa [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2287.48s)]
*  May at Downing Street, you had a company that was supported by the US and we had a lot of [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  back and forth, that company I've left that now and I'm about to start my new AI startup, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2298.88s)]
*  why should I stay in and do that again in London with this particular difficulties [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2304.2s)]
*  around both the funding side of it but also in terms of the, I would say the lack of clarity [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2309.2s)]
*  in what startup founders can do, not only in the equity side but also you mentioned [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2314.8399999999997s)]
*  about control and maintaining that and I found that very difficult with the current set of [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2318.48s)]
*  regulations and I have to say Companies House has also been very difficult for us entrepreneurs [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2322.96s)]
*  and so you're talking about people leaving the UK, I'm considering that as a British [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2327.6s)]
*  entrepreneur with multiple, and I'm on the actually progress list, so I'm one of those [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2332.44s)]
*  people that have been supportive of this whole action for the last 10 years that has been [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2335.44s)]
*  going on, why should I continue to do that? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2340.04s)]
*  I think a number of things that this government have done just in the first six months. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2342.92s)]
*  We extended the EIS and the Venture Capital Trust schemes by an additional 10 years to [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2347.8s)]
*  help angel investors invest in startups and entrepreneurs. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2355.04s)]
*  The reforms I've made that I've spoken to Emma and David about in terms of pension funds [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2360.96s)]
*  to help entrepreneurs like you get access to that long term patient capital. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2365.7200000000003s)]
*  The changes we've made to the London Stock Exchange for founders when listing, hopefully [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2372.36s)]
*  if you get to that stage would benefit people like you to be able to keep control whilst [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2377.48s)]
*  also accessing those capital markets and things like the intermittent trading that you can [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2382.6800000000003s)]
*  try out trading on the London Stock Exchange before going for an IPO or also things. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2388.72s)]
*  But also if you're in the AI space you should look at the AI opportunities plan that the [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2394.0s)]
*  Prime Minister published last Monday. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2397.4s)]
*  The investment zones, the regulatory reforms are all about trying to help some of those [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2400.8s)]
*  fast growing sectors particularly in areas like AI innovate and stay in the UK. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQOUzsZ8cg&t=2407.52s)]
