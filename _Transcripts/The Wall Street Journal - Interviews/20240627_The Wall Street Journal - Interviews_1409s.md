# Chipotleâ€™s Founder on Reinventing the Fast Food Industry, Robotics and More | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70)
*  I know you have strong opinions about how restaurants are run today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=0.0s)]
*  Labor costs turn over. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=3.9s)]
*  It's just too high. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=5.34s)]
*  What do you think about how restaurants are run [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  and how they could be improved? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, I think back 31 years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=10.58s)]
*  So it'll be the 31st anniversary of Chipotle this coming July. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=15.5s)]
*  And we all knew what the fast food format looked like. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=23.52s)]
*  We knew how they operated. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=26.22s)]
*  And then Chipotle came along and we did things differently. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=27.54s)]
*  In fact, we did everything differently. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  And it turned out to be a platform that's quite popular. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=33.9s)]
*  Now you see fast casual restaurants opening very successfully, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  bringing really great food to the eating public. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=41.5s)]
*  And I think that's awesome. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  The platform that we have at Kernel is yet another complete change, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=48.7s)]
*  a complete reinvention of the way restaurants work. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  And it has so many benefits, but to name a couple of highlights, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=56.88s)]
*  the food can be much, much better. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=62.76s)]
*  You can really elevate the food through very, very careful and intricate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=65.2s)]
*  and precise preparation, which accounts for most of the success [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=69.76s)]
*  of any particular dish or menu. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=74.76s)]
*  And we have a production system that requires fewer people to operate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=77.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of automation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=82.32s)]
*  There's some robotics. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=84.24s)]
*  It's digital first. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=85.56s)]
*  And so normally when you see maybe a dozen people at peak period [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=87.04s)]
*  at a typical restaurant, we would have three. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  And they're working alongside this automated robotic production system. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  And the precision and the consistency and the reduction of the monotony [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=102.04s)]
*  for producing large orders throughout the day is extraordinary. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  So the platform is really working, and I'm very, very proud of it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=113.94s)]
*  So really this new Kernel platform does two things, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=117.54s)]
*  better food, better economic model. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=121.22s)]
*  So you're four months in. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=124.18s)]
*  You're calling it kind of a beta phase of Kernel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=125.3s)]
*  What have you learned so far? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=128.26s)]
*  So I think we got the platform right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=129.94s)]
*  We have a central kitchen that's just a few blocks away, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=135.1s)]
*  and that will serve us lower Manhattan. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  And call it a one to 15 or so hub and spoke model. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=144.08s)]
*  And freshly prepped food is constantly delivered [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=149.08s)]
*  to the restaurants throughout the day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=152.08s)]
*  So there's very, very low inventory. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=153.72s)]
*  And the freshness, very, very high. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=156.08s)]
*  And that we can deliver accurately on time, piping hot, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  beautifully composed is great. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=166.16s)]
*  And the reduction of stress on the three employees is extraordinary. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  And so I'm very, very proud of that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=175.34s)]
*  I got some things wrong though. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  So the way the restaurant presented to the customer was, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=179.02s)]
*  I think, a little bit too future. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  People opened the door. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=185.3s)]
*  They came in and they're like, what is this? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a restaurant. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=188.78s)]
*  But it's not obvious it's a restaurant. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=190.3s)]
*  You see a robot arm. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  You see, you know, seafoam green cubbies with lights on them and things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=193.44s)]
*  And people were a little confused. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=197.68s)]
*  So we're closing next week. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=199.6s)]
*  We're going to do a little refresh in the front of the house and have some things [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=201.56s)]
*  that typical restaurants have, like some seating [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=207.56s)]
*  and some softness and some pictures. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=209.68s)]
*  And so I think that one I missed the mark on. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=211.6s)]
*  But we'll quickly pivot. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=214.84s)]
*  And again, we're in beta. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  I started out, you know, with a strict vegan diet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=218.04s)]
*  And we've meandered into vegetarian. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=221.16s)]
*  So we've included cheese and some sauces that are mayonnaise based, so some egg yolk. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=224.9s)]
*  And that's been very popular while still preserving vegan options [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=230.38s)]
*  for our vegan customers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=234.9s)]
*  And we'll probably explore a chicken sandwich, a real chicken sandwich. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=236.94s)]
*  Right now we have a fake chicken sandwich. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=242.1s)]
*  And I think that I got that wrong too. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=244.38s)]
*  The entire menu is real food. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=247.18s)]
*  And when I say real food, I like to go back to Michael Pollan's mantra. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  And it guides the way I eat. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's a really healthy way to think about diets. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=258.36s)]
*  And the mantra is, as most of you know, it's eat food, mostly plants, not too much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=263.48s)]
*  And what he means by that is eat food, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=270.52s)]
*  food that your grandparents would recognize, whole raw ingredients, grains, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=272.44s)]
*  legumes, veggies, meats, things like this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=277.08s)]
*  Mostly plants though, focusing on grains, legumes, veggies with some animal protein. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=281.14s)]
*  And then not too much, and that's of course the responsibility of the customer [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=287.5s)]
*  according to his or her, you know, caloric needs. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=291.22s)]
*  And so the part of the menu that I got wrong is that I had a fried chicken sandwich. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=294.58s)]
*  That was not chicken. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  It was very good. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=302.66s)]
*  It's actually delicious. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=305.42s)]
*  But it was more of an engineered product. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=306.62s)]
*  And I think I would be much more proud of a real chicken, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=309.28s)]
*  coming from of course a really great source. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=314.08s)]
*  And we're vetting a chicken farmer upstate right now, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=316.76s)]
*  who I think is gonna make the cut. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's a very, very special, it'll be a very, very special chicken sandwich. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=322.32s)]
*  How are sales and margins so far? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=325.64s)]
*  I know again, it's only four months in. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=327.28s)]
*  Yeah. What are you seeing now? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  And what do you think in the future? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=330.64s)]
*  Yeah, so we deliberately started off very, very slow. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  We didn't do any marketing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=335.8s)]
*  It was a very quiet opening because the platform was really not tested, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=337.9s)]
*  And so I didn't wanna have lines out the door and having this thing fail. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=343.58s)]
*  And the system crashed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=348.14s)]
*  In the first month we had crashes where it could close down the restaurant for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=349.3s)]
*  the whole lunch period, sometimes for five or ten minutes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=353.54s)]
*  That was happening in the first month. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=357.94s)]
*  It's been very, very stable lately. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=359.94s)]
*  So now we've started to do some more marketing and a lot of digital stuff. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=361.86s)]
*  And we're driving customers in and they're liking it very much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=366.76s)]
*  Too early to talk about margins, but [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=371.2s)]
*  I will say that the overall economic model wins for a number of reasons. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=372.72s)]
*  We are in a space that's less than 1,000 square feet. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=377.6s)]
*  We don't have an investment in any of the typical infrastructure. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=382.92s)]
*  There's no gas or hood or venting or, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  and the power requirement is less than 200 amps. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=392.08s)]
*  So it's really, really sort of light and very little investment. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=395.04s)]
*  Our labor, of course, is only three people. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  Now we pay them a lot more. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=403.74s)]
*  We pay them a handsome hourly wage plus benefits plus paid vacation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=405.26000000000005s)]
*  And our HR team now is working on an equity program designed for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  hourly employees, something that they can really relate to and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  get into because we want to share a piece of the action with them, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=422.34s)]
*  the potential upside. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  And so really those are two big factors on the economic model. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  So margins are gonna be great, we just need to build the business. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=433.26s)]
*  So I'm calling the grand opening for this thing happening on July 10th. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  So that's coming up in just a couple of weeks. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=443.73999999999995s)]
*  And you'll see the new image, you'll see the new menu items. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  And I'm ready. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=451.06s)]
*  So you're a futurist of sorts. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=454.26s)]
*  Look in your crystal ball and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=456.94s)]
*  when do you think you could see widespread automation in restaurants? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=458.3s)]
*  In five years, in ten years, when could we really see the benefits of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=462.1s)]
*  automation helping this labor intensive industry? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=467.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you're starting to see it creep in already. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=470.82s)]
*  I think that Sweetgreen has done a really nice job [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=474.94s)]
*  with bringing in the folks who started Spice Kitchen. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=481.22s)]
*  Some really great thinkers in automation and robotics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=485.58s)]
*  And they built their infinity kitchen and it's here in Naperville. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=489.54s)]
*  And I went and visited a few months ago, it's pretty awesome. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=493.3s)]
*  It's not exactly the way we think about automation, but it's a way and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=496.74s)]
*  it works well for them. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=500.78s)]
*  I think many people are going to dabble in different kinds of automation and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=502.5s)]
*  robotics that might work for them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=506.7s)]
*  Colonel is really a, it really is from the ground up different. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=508.18s)]
*  Everything's different and it's a platform that's built for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=516.1s)]
*  the technology that we know is coming. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=519.78s)]
*  And it's going to be very easy for us to plug in new technology into the platform. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=523.94s)]
*  And then the folks who are working there will probably move more [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=530.5s)]
*  toward the customer facing positions, focusing on hospitality. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=535.06s)]
*  Maybe monitoring a dashboard, it's just to make sure the systems are working. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=539.42s)]
*  But we're really reinventing the fast food work. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=545.14s)]
*  If you think about why is our turnover rate so high? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=548.66s)]
*  I mean you hear numbers like 150% annualized turnover in these restaurants. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=552.26s)]
*  And it's very difficult to operate with that kind of instability. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=556.3399999999999s)]
*  No one's really getting expert at their particular job. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=560.6199999999999s)]
*  And it's especially important to get this under control for [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=564.46s)]
*  fast casual restaurants where there's a lot of prep being done in the restaurants. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=567.7s)]
*  There's still real cooking, knives and cutting boards and pots and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  pans and things. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  We've moved away from fast food into this real cooking. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=576.7s)]
*  So it's important to really keep people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=580.1s)]
*  So reinventing the work I think is very, very important. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=583.4200000000001s)]
*  There's two parts of it, the pay and the work. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=587.5s)]
*  And you've got to reinvent both of them. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=589.98s)]
*  So why do people not wanna stay in these jobs? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=592.3s)]
*  It's just the nature of the work. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=594.74s)]
*  Young people today, I don't know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=597.62s)]
*  is that they don't wanna cook in a fast food kitchen. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=598.8599999999999s)]
*  Do you have to make the jobs just easier? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=601.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean I can't answer that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=604.42s)]
*  But when I was a kid, I was in high school in the 80s and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=606.06s)]
*  I had fast food jobs and mowed lawns and did things like that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=611.38s)]
*  And as did all my peers, that's what we did. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=615.06s)]
*  It doesn't seem that that's the typical experience today. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=617.8599999999999s)]
*  And I'm not saying that's bad or good or whatever. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=621.5s)]
*  It's just like the reality is that if you're operating a business [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=624.26s)]
*  that depends on lots of labor, I think you're gonna be in trouble. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=629.7800000000001s)]
*  So and people are realizing that and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=634.62s)]
*  starting to migrate toward more automation. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=637.02s)]
*  Someone is gonna get it right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=640.4200000000001s)]
*  Someone's going to figure out this code of the right kind of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=642.0600000000001s)]
*  platform system and- [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=646.38s)]
*  Maybe that's you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=648.42s)]
*  Well, I'm hoping. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=650.62s)]
*  I think we're building a great team of engineers and coders and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=651.9799999999999s)]
*  people who are thinking about the technical aspects of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  bringing this thing together and preparing it to again receive [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=662.78s)]
*  more technology that we know is going to become available. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  And it's super exciting. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  But on the restaurant side of it, on the food side of it, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=672.54s)]
*  I'm really proud of the platform's ability to have a dedicated central kitchen. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  And this isn't like a commissary. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=682.26s)]
*  A lot of fast casual restaurants use commissaries for [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=684.86s)]
*  things that have a longer shelf life and is generally in a slow distribution system. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=689.06s)]
*  Our central kitchen is in a fast distribution system, so [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  constant flow of freshly prepped food. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=698.3s)]
*  And the chefs with their team of prep cooks are turning out amazing food. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=701.38s)]
*  I mean, this is like really fine dining quality stuff. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=706.94s)]
*  What's cool about the, one of the things that's really cool about the kernel menu [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=710.5400000000001s)]
*  is that we have these lots of vegetable side dishes. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=715.26s)]
*  And it's not just the vegetable, but it's the vegetable, a grain or [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=718.7s)]
*  legume component, a sauce component, and a crunch component. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=723.02s)]
*  And each of the different vegetables compositions has these various parts to it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=727.54s)]
*  It's intensive prep work, but then the system [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  churns these things out very precisely and very consistently. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=739.42s)]
*  Customers are loving it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=744.66s)]
*  And I'm really excited that we could make these kinds of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=745.74s)]
*  vegetable sides part of the fast food diet. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=751.5s)]
*  I think it's really exciting. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=754.74s)]
*  That's what I was about to ask you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=756.06s)]
*  Zooming out, you talk about the Michael Pollan diet. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=757.38s)]
*  This is how we should be eating. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=759.74s)]
*  But so many Americans don't eat like that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=760.98s)]
*  How do you change the American diet? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=763.74s)]
*  So it depends on how you look at it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=765.74s)]
*  Like if vegetables are not available, if they're not part of the offering, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=768.78s)]
*  of course they're not going to be part of your diet. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=777.98s)]
*  When they're delicious and part of the offering and fairly priced, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=780.1s)]
*  people are going to eat them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=783.86s)]
*  And so you have to make them available and you have to make them delicious. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=785.7s)]
*  You have to make them accessible. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=789.78s)]
*  How are your meals priced and what's the fair price in your mind? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=791.66s)]
*  People are commenting in New York City that our meals are very fairly priced. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=794.78s)]
*  And I would say that if you look at the fast casual spectrum, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=799.5s)]
*  we're probably on the lower side of fast casual with some things [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=804.02s)]
*  in kind of like the fast food range. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=808.94s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of fast food, value wars are playing out in restaurants right now. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=812.8599999999999s)]
*  Consumers are fatigued. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=816.8599999999999s)]
*  They're just like, we want something that's a deal. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=818.3s)]
*  How do you fit this concept into kind of an ethos among consumers right now? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=821.54s)]
*  We need a break. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=826.38s)]
*  Yeah, so it was interesting. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=827.38s)]
*  So I opened Chipotle in 1993 and my chicken burrito, I think, was $4.25. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=828.8599999999999s)]
*  And people said, Steve, you're crazy. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=840.26s)]
*  That's the fair price for this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=843.26s)]
*  And this is Taco Bell was doing menus that had 59, 79, and 99 cents. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=845.86s)]
*  And people said, well, no one's going to pay 4.25. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=851.78s)]
*  McDonald's had dollar menus and bundled value meals. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=854.46s)]
*  In fact, they all had these kinds of these. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=858.06s)]
*  And so people said, you're not showing the right kind of value. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=860.06s)]
*  And really what was not part of the fast food thought, I think, at the time, is that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=864.78s)]
*  quality is part of the value equation. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=871.78s)]
*  And so we were, of course, pushing boundaries on the quality of ingredients, not only fresh [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=874.78s)]
*  ingredients, but understanding the provenance, how animals are raised, how veggies are raised. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=882.38s)]
*  And people loved it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=888.98s)]
*  So value is a tricky one. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=890.98s)]
*  When you have something of great quality, you can charge a fair price for it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=892.98s)]
*  And I want folks in the audience to start thinking about questions because we'll be [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=898.98s)]
*  going to questions soon. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=903.78s)]
*  So you've created big things from scratch. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=905.78s)]
*  It's a difficult time to be doing that. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=908.78s)]
*  I've created a big thing. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=910.78s)]
*  Well, and a new thing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=912.78s)]
*  We can see if we can go plural. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=915.18s)]
*  Any advice to entrepreneurs about how to start something new in today's business environment? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=917.18s)]
*  I don't know if today's business environment is any or how it's different from when I started. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=922.18s)]
*  Chipotle, really. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=928.18s)]
*  I think that maybe the fundamentals would be the same. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=930.18s)]
*  I mean, I believed passionately in what I was doing. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=932.18s)]
*  I believe that the things that I was doing, I believe that the things that I was doing [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=936.18s)]
*  I believed in passionately in what I was doing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  I really, I loved the menu. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=944.5799999999999s)]
*  I loved the way we organized the ordering and the design. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=948.5799999999999s)]
*  It was such a departure from typical fast food. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=954.5799999999999s)]
*  And to me, it just made so much sense. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=956.5799999999999s)]
*  You know, you think about the ubiquity of that today. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=958.5799999999999s)]
*  But back in 93, customers would walk in and poke their head in and turn and walk away. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=964.5799999999999s)]
*  They didn't get it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=970.98s)]
*  Or customers would walk right to the cash register. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=972.98s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, not this. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=974.98s)]
*  You have to go over there. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=976.98s)]
*  And people are like, wait a minute. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=978.98s)]
*  Every single fast food place, you walk to the cash register. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=980.98s)]
*  And then they'd say, well, I'd like a chicken burrito. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=982.98s)]
*  And then we'd have a number of questions for them. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=984.98s)]
*  And that was a lot of friction. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=986.98s)]
*  People didn't understand why so many questions. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=988.98s)]
*  Just whatever. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=990.98s)]
*  Give me what it comes with. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=992.98s)]
*  And so really, there was lots of learning. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=994.98s)]
*  You know, it was not obvious that it was going to be a wild success from day one. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=997.38s)]
*  But you have to just stick to your guns and keep at it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1003.38s)]
*  You have to listen to customers. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1005.38s)]
*  But listen to them in the right way. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1007.38s)]
*  You know, a lot of customers were telling me, oh, you need more menu variety. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1009.38s)]
*  You only have two things, burritos and tacos. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1013.38s)]
*  I said, yes, but the combinations make it a big menu. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1015.38s)]
*  But you need dessert and you need coffee and you need this and you need that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1017.38s)]
*  And I really stuck to my guns for decades. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1023.38s)]
*  About simplicity and streamlining operations. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1025.7800000000002s)]
*  And instead of offering more variety, offering more quality. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1027.7800000000002s)]
*  But you've got to, as an entrepreneur, you have to figure out your niche. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1029.7800000000002s)]
*  And you have to maybe try to figure out what customers want even though they're not asking for it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1031.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, asking our customers, our audience, any questions for Steve? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1033.7800000000002s)]
*  No media takers. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1036.18s)]
*  Well, then I get to ask you more questions. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1038.18s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1040.18s)]
*  Are you still going to Chipotle, why or why not? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1042.18s)]
*  So I don't know about you, but I've been to Chipotle. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1044.18s)]
*  I've been to the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1046.18s)]
*  Still going to Chipotle? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1062.16s)]
*  Why or why not? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1063.52s)]
*  So, I don't go to Chipotle much at all anymore. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1064.52s)]
*  I am in Colonel all the time. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1069.96s)]
*  So if you stop by for lunch at Colonel, that's where I am and that's what I'm eating. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1073.0s)]
*  So Chipotle has had issues lately on social media about their portion sizes. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1079.68s)]
*  I know you have strong feelings about Chipotle's portions and being, what do you think of them? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1085.8s)]
*  So again, diets are so individual, right? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1093.84s)]
*  Everyone needs different amounts of calories depending on how many calories they burn. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1098.6s)]
*  People have different kind of eating habits and so who am I to judge? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  I would say that those who complain about, I mean, I've never experienced someone walking out of Chipotle hungry, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1111.72s)]
*  by the way, in my 30 some odd years. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1119.0s)]
*  I mean, that just doesn't happen. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1120.96s)]
*  So those who complain about portion sizes, I'm not sure I quite get it, but I understand it's a thing out there. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1122.4s)]
*  I just sort of chuckle because Chipotle is quite generous. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1128.68s)]
*  It always has been and I think it always will be. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1134.04s)]
*  We had the president McDonald's on earlier today who was asked about should McDonald's be a treat? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  Should we eat it regularly? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1146.28s)]
*  What do you think about eating fast food? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1148.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I assume that's not part of your diet, but what about Americans diet? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1150.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, my argument with Chipotle was that just because it's fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1154.56s)]
*  I mean, most of us eat fast food or fast casual food or eat convenient food. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1163.56s)]
*  And so there's nothing preventing us from making that food really wholesome, really delicious. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1169.8s)]
*  I think and I think it really if you go back to Michael Pollan as a guide, eat food, mostly plants, not too much and make it really scrumptious, really delicious. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  You can you can give the option to people to eat foods that are probably really good for them. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1190.12s)]
*  So Alice Waters last night talked about local local food and trying to eat more locally. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  And she said, you know, it's doable. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1207.8s)]
*  You've also built supply chains from scratch, really focused on local producers. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1210.36s)]
*  How realistic is that for mainstream restaurants? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1216.12s)]
*  It's more difficult for chain restaurants. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1219.36s)]
*  And in my experience at Chipotle, I opened I opened in the summer when corn was in season and I took corn off the cob with a knife. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1222.32s)]
*  And and then winter came around. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  And of course, you know, we're not shucking corn in the winter. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1235.8s)]
*  Tomatoes were in season in the summer. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1241.4799999999998s)]
*  And so and I and I stuck with that menu year round. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1243.48s)]
*  And and you know that that cilantro is not grown in in the north. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1248.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, this is our cilantro is grown in mostly in California. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1254.96s)]
*  And so and so, you know, you have to reply, rely on a distribution system. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1259.04s)]
*  So I think I think it's it's a nice notion to eat more locally and and more seasonally. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1263.8400000000001s)]
*  It does present a challenge for chain operators because people want their usual stuff. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1273.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, we're going to try to push boundaries at Kernel. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1281.1999999999998s)]
*  We have a base menu of things that are generally available year round. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1284.36s)]
*  But but then we will try to offer seasonal vegetable compositions as they are available in the farmers market just a few a few blocks away. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1290.76s)]
*  As you scale, though, and are operating in multiple states, that becomes an extraordinary and extraordinary difficulty. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1301.0s)]
*  So so I think you can still have really good quality veggies, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  but you have to know that they're going to come from different parts of the country and maybe even different parts of the world. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1319.2s)]
*  And this distribution system is part of that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1324.4s)]
*  I think we're getting better, though, at at reducing greenhouse gases from our from our transportation. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1328.68s)]
*  You know, our transportation is becoming much more efficient and thoughtful. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1336.4s)]
*  So I think that can that can help offset. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1340.68s)]
*  Just last. What's your go to Kernel order? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1343.88s)]
*  You know, I'm I'm cycling through so many things right now. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1346.8s)]
*  But the chef, Andrew, came up with it with a great new sandwich. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1351.24s)]
*  It's a it's a take on sort of a classic eggplant parm. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1356.76s)]
*  And it's on our toasted brioche like bun that we get from Balthazar. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1361.08s)]
*  And the eggplant, it's a it's a it's a fried eggplant patty. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  And usually you see the eggplant parms, but you know, you cut them into into rounds. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1373.64s)]
*  Right. But but you only have one perfectly sized round out of the eggplant. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1379.92s)]
*  So he he chops this up and roasts eggplant and puts it back together with the mozzarella cheese on the inside. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1384.2s)]
*  And and it has some other legumes and veggies in that and then breads that and fries it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1390.16s)]
*  And it's the most delicious thing with marinara sauce. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1396.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it just tastes like grandma made it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1398.88s)]
*  And and I'm very proud of that. So that's my that's my hopefully we'll get to try it next year. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGCDdpfg70&t=1401.0400000000002s)]
