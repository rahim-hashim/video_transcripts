**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4)
*  Sarah also teed up that you guys recently, just yesterday, had quite a gangbusters earnings [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  report. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=6.48s)]
*  I think stock went up over 10% double digits. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=7.48s)]
*  Hard topic to talk about when you guys are doing so well, but just I'm curious how, what [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  do you attribute that success to for you guys at CrowdStrike and across the industry, do [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  you think that is going to foretell more growth, more success, especially sort of as people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=22.16s)]
*  continue to think about AI investments in cyber security? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=29.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=32.32s)]
*  So as many have discussed and I'm sure many know and here it's still a challenging environment [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=33.32s)]
*  out afield. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=38.96s)]
*  What we've seen though is that customers are really focused on stock overreaches, right, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=42.72s)]
*  and the technologies and companies that can help. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's one of the areas when I started the company, that's our, you know, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  we have a mission statement, we have a mission, stop the breach. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=53.92s)]
*  And I think we've been able to do that for many customers, many are in the audience, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=56.88s)]
*  I saw them on the roster here, so we appreciate that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  But there's been a lot of talk around the platform play and the platform wars and it's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=64.36s)]
*  something that I really focused on when I got the company going in 2011. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=70.16s)]
*  But if we can add more value, more capabilities to a customer's environment, we can consolidate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=74.6s)]
*  other technologies they have, help them save money, give them a better experience with [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=80.4s)]
*  a single platform and a single agent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, we're going to give them a better outcome with just stopping the breach. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=87.56s)]
*  And that's been a big part of it, whether that's our endpoint protection technology [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=90.48s)]
*  or now next gen SIM, identity protection, our cloud suite of technologies, it all comes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  together with one mission, stopping breaches. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=102.04s)]
*  So I think that's resonated in the field. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  It's been certainly challenging for lots of folks. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=106.68s)]
*  But I think if you have the right people and the right technologies and you take care of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=109.48s)]
*  the customers, good things happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned adding value for customers just when you look at the next six months or so, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  complicated threat environment out there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=119.68s)]
*  We have an election coming up, ransomware continues to be a huge problem. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=121.0s)]
*  What are the strategic priorities for CrowdStrike as you look at the back half of this year [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=125.64s)]
*  and into the next year? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=129.24s)]
*  As a company or from an industry perspective? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=131.56s)]
*  As a company or as a broader industry, what do you think the priorities should be? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=133.96s)]
*  As a company, we're always focused on being on the leading edge of protecting new technologies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=139.24s)]
*  I've talked about this for a while and that security is a complicated space. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=145.08s)]
*  If you think about security, there isn't just one behemoth that does everything. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=150.84s)]
*  If you go to RSA, you've got 5,000 plus companies that are out there because the technology [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=157.44s)]
*  curve has almost gone up exponentially. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=162.88s)]
*  You need security that parallels the technology curve. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  I remember when I got into security 30 plus years ago, it was barely firewalls and it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=169.28s)]
*  was a website and a Cisco router. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=174.12s)]
*  You're blocking low number of ports. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=177.56s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=179.44000000000003s)]
*  Now, think about all the complexity with AI and cloud environments. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  As the technology curve increases its slope, you need security that parallels that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=185.28000000000003s)]
*  Not any one company can do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, we handle our area and we focus on it, but there's many other companies that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=192.11999999999998s)]
*  a Cisco needs to be able to protect their environment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=197.16s)]
*  I think that's a big part of it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=201.44s)]
*  As AI emerges in terms of an attack vector, as people think about how they use AI and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=203.64s)]
*  we're still in the formative stages for many companies, they've got chat GP, they're trying [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=211.04s)]
*  to figure it out, they're worried about putting data into it and what does it all mean? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=215.44s)]
*  Ultimately, as this evolves, it's going to be a similar process to the CI CD pipeline. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=219.6s)]
*  You're going to have your AI pipeline, everything from gathering the data, curating the data, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=225.16s)]
*  creating the training models and then moving into inference and everything in between. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=231.56s)]
*  You're going to need guard rails across all of those. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=235.28s)]
*  On AI, clearly that's a huge game changer, not just for the industry, but technology [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=238.28s)]
*  writ large. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=243.16s)]
*  There's been so much focus on the perils of AI and the cybersecurity landscape of being [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=245.2s)]
*  able to write malware. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=249.6s)]
*  We've seen it used crudely in the disinformation space, but it's clearly also can be very useful [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=251.44s)]
*  in the defense space. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=257.52s)]
*  Do you see AI as more of a threat to cybersecurity or more of an opportunity or is it a net zero? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=259.62s)]
*  How do you think about dealing with those next-gen AI threats versus the opportunities [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  to help protect customers? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=272.96s)]
*  It's a foundational element that I started CrowdStrike with as an AI-native company. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=277.56s)]
*  At the time, it was machine learning and being able to use that to detect these attacks without [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=282.28s)]
*  ever seeing before. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=287.8s)]
*  Obviously in the later years, you've got generative AI, which came out well past when I started [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  CrowdStrike. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=294.36s)]
*  I think it's a real boon for security practitioners. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=295.76s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=300.96s)]
*  Part of security and what we need to do is to really what I call bend time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=301.96s)]
*  In security, every company here is going to have some level of incident. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=308.44s)]
*  What you want to do is make sure that incident doesn't turn into a breach. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=312.4s)]
*  Any big company is going to have that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  If you can bend time, that's going to help you deal with that incident and make sure [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=318.64s)]
*  that it doesn't grow into something much bigger. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=322.9s)]
*  Our breakout times, which we track off our website, have come down dramatically. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=327.2s)]
*  Now it's 62 minutes, meaning that if an attacker gets onto a system, like some we're going [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=331.12s)]
*  to talk about here in a minute, it on average takes 62 minutes before they can move laterally [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=336.72s)]
*  somewhere else. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=340.76s)]
*  We've seen this as low as two minutes and seven seconds. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=342.2s)]
*  If you can bend time and you can get in front of this, you have a much greater probability [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=346.8s)]
*  of stopping the adversary. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=350.8s)]
*  That's one piece. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  The second piece then is, well, what does it mean for the adversary? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=354.44s)]
*  What does AI mean? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=357.4s)]
*  Well, the defenders are going to be able to use it to help bend time and make their job [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=358.4s)]
*  easier, but so is the adversary. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=363.2s)]
*  What I think we're seeing is this democratization of skill sets that can be brought to the masses. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  In the grand scheme of things, there's eight billion plus people in the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=374.32s)]
*  In the grand scheme of things, there's a relative handful of people that really have the know-how [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  to create these sort of exploits and malware and disassemble things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=382.56s)]
*  There's a lot of them, but in the grand scheme of eight billion, it's not much. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  What you're going to see is many more threat actors emerge. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=390.44s)]
*  You're going to see a proliferation of that because it's so easy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  All that knowledge comes from the pyramid. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  If you think about a pyramid of the best at the top, it all comes down and you're going [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=399.44s)]
*  to have many more new adversaries and crime actors in that middle band. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=403.12s)]
*  I want to talk about threat actors more in a minute, but just on AI and the business [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=408.24s)]
*  implications of that, there's concerns about the AI industry and where it's going to top [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=414.0s)]
*  out. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=419.28s)]
*  Do you have concerns that there could be some sort of AI bubble in the cybersecurity industry [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=420.28s)]
*  that that is fueling a lot of the growth you're seeing currently and that that could come [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=423.4s)]
*  crashing down at some point when maybe AI defense systems aren't as robust as maybe [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=428.56s)]
*  people want them to be? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=433.48s)]
*  I don't see an AI bubble. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=434.48s)]
*  I think in some cases, the LLMs will be commoditized and then how you actually create value around [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=435.88s)]
*  those. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  A lot of them started as massive large language models. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  What we're seeing is that you can create smaller ones that give pretty good efficacy but are [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=449.08s)]
*  much more cost effective and are bespoke to the application that you're building it for. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=454.67999999999995s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of innovation around leveraging AI and how you actually [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  use it and what you use and how you create it and how you train it and those sort of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  things. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=471.04s)]
*  I don't see it as a bubble in cybersecurity. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=472.04s)]
*  I think we're really in the early innings when we show customers that you can take eight [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=475.12s)]
*  hours of grunt work in a security operations center and do it in 10 minutes when you could [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=479.16s)]
*  write a situational report in 10 seconds because you're a prompt engineer. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=483.32000000000005s)]
*  Charlotte can put all this information together and basically give you a whole situational [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=490.96s)]
*  report of an incident. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=495.23999999999995s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it's only going to fuel cybersecurity in terms of allowing people to move faster [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  and get better outcomes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  Maybe there's bubbles in other areas of AI but I think cybersecurity is not one of them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=506.08s)]
*  I want to turn to a topic that I don't think you've been too shy about which is Microsoft. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  They are a large security product vendor, huge in the space. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=517.36s)]
*  Recently there was the U.S. government report, the Cyber Safety Review Board came out and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=524.16s)]
*  knocked them pretty aggressively for a government document saying they had inadequate security [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  culture because of the way that they handled a Chinese hack on State Department and Commerce [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=533.24s)]
*  Department officials tracing back to last summer or was identified last summer. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  It's really remarkable to see that and since then Microsoft has said they're overhauling [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=545.84s)]
*  their security, sort of prioritizing that as a top of mind. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=550.0s)]
*  But CrowdStrike and others have sort of taken that as an opportunity to point out that there [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  are other security opportunities out there as well. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=560.64s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you, what did you make of that report? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  How significant was it to see a government sort of pretty sharply criticize security [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=567.84s)]
*  practices at one of your competitors and has that been an opportunity for you guys? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=573.84s)]
*  Well I thought it was a very fair and well written report and as you said it didn't really [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=580.4s)]
*  pull any punches and I think that was the beauty of the report. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  It basically stated the facts. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=593.64s)]
*  There were a lot of people that worked on that report and I think they did a fantastic [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=595.12s)]
*  of laying out the facts of just the crisis and confidence in Microsoft and what they're [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=599.2s)]
*  doing and sort of the culture of putting dollars first and licensing first above security. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=606.0s)]
*  Even if you look at the latest recall feature which is now a buzz as you take screenshots [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=613.08s)]
*  and store it in a SQLite database, that may not be the best thing in the world. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=618.2800000000001s)]
*  You have to look at words are words and actions are different and you have to look at the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=623.64s)]
*  actions versus the words so we'll see what happens there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=629.4s)]
*  If anyone hasn't read the report you should go out and read it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=632.64s)]
*  It's off the CISA website and whether it's the culture they talked about or just even [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=635.0s)]
*  some of the areas in terms of being forthright in their blog and the timing around it and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  the transparency. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=648.6s)]
*  There was a lack of I think transparency and quite honestly being forthright about what [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=649.6s)]
*  happened and it's all laid out factually in the report. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=656.96s)]
*  Reports should stand on its own but obviously there's some challenges that they're going [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=661.4s)]
*  to need to overcome. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=665.04s)]
*  Just on the recall product, some security researchers have said that's kind of a huge [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=666.04s)]
*  threat surface for customers who use that. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=671.2s)]
*  That's a concern you share? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=676.36s)]
*  Should Microsoft consider recalling the recall? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=677.36s)]
*  If you have a bunch of sensitive information and you store it in a SQLite database that's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=681.84s)]
*  on the system, I can tell you the first place where somebody's going to go if they get on [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=685.84s)]
*  it is they're going to start looking for that information. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=689.12s)]
*  I can understand features and making it easier for people and they want to progress their [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=692.84s)]
*  operating system but it has to be done in a secure way but I think it's indicative of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  the lack of security culture within the organization when you put out features like this. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=705.92s)]
*  We've seen this time and time again whether it's some of the challenges, the architectural [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=712.6s)]
*  decisions that were made around Active Directory way back when, we're still living with. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=717.28s)]
*  Do you think Microsoft just popped into being a major cloud provider and just rebuilt everything [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=721.24s)]
*  or do you think they took what they had and retooled it for the cloud? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=727.08s)]
*  A lot of the challenges and I talked about this in the Senate hearing, a lot of the architectural [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=731.08s)]
*  challenges that you've seen has been moved into the cloud. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=735.4s)]
*  Why is it that that operating system is so easy to just pluck encrypted passwords out [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=739.0s)]
*  and reuse those? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  When you look at other operating systems, they're just built differently. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=745.88s)]
*  It's much harder to do that the way they create these passwords and the way the directories [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=748.48s)]
*  are maintained. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=752.52s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want to get too far afield but a lot of these challenges have started [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=753.52s)]
*  with decisions 25 years ago. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=759.44s)]
*  They haven't gotten any better today. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=761.32s)]
*  There's been a lot of concern about anti-competitive behavior in the technology industry, not specifically [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=765.0s)]
*  so much cybersecurity but I want to pose a question to you. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  With Microsoft or other large technology companies, are you concerned about the possibility of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  anti-competitive practices in the cybersecurity field? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  I think you have to look at that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=782.4799999999999s)]
*  There's been plenty of customers who have come up to me and basically said they're in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=784.4799999999999s)]
*  the middle of an E5 license and they just think that the practices are predatory for [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=790.56s)]
*  Microsoft and they're too scared to speak up about it in their own organizations and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=794.92s)]
*  certainly externally. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=800.52s)]
*  I think when you have that level of fear of saying something and when customers are using [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  the term predatory, it's cause for concern. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=808.4s)]
*  I think security is one of those areas where, yes, it's a business. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  All the companies and vendors are trying to make a profit on it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=818.2s)]
*  We've got that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=822.6s)]
*  We're also trying to help customers. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=823.6s)]
*  If you're putting all of the interest ahead of the customers, I think that's really where [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=825.5600000000001s)]
*  you run afoul. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=830.24s)]
*  It's a balancing act of doing the right thing for a customer and keeping organizations and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=832.32s)]
*  governments safe and also making it a viable business. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=837.48s)]
*  Microsoft, of course, would say they do put the customer first when it comes to security [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  and that they're structured in a way that mitigates any anti-competitive concerns, but [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  I appreciate your remarks. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=851.04s)]
*  Let's move on to some threats. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of elections around the globe this year and we've seen some actors in other [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=857.32s)]
*  spaces already, but as we think about November, there's most likely going to be a very sleepy, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=861.64s)]
*  not very tense election that we're going to have here in the US. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=868.84s)]
*  You use that term, sleepy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=872.96s)]
*  I meant nothing by that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=876.44s)]
*  Certainly we're going to have a lot of companionship and camaraderie on both sides coming together. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=880.0400000000001s)]
*  Not going to be very tense, but amid that environment, how are you and how is CrowdStrike [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=886.2800000000001s)]
*  thinking about election security, which can mean so many things. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=892.32s)]
*  Of course, it can mean attacks on the infrastructure itself, voting systems. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=894.9200000000001s)]
*  It can mean disinformation. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=899.12s)]
*  It can mean hack and leak. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=900.12s)]
*  How are you thinking about what Russia might be up to, what China might be up to, and sort [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=902.52s)]
*  of this election in 2024, helping to identify what's going on and reassure the American [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=906.24s)]
*  voter that it's going to be a secure election? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=912.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=915.76s)]
*  If you think about 2024 versus 2016, I think there's a lot of expertise that has been gained [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=916.76s)]
*  by the likes of Russia and China, Iran, others. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  The technology environment has dramatically changed. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=926.4s)]
*  The deep fake technology today is so good. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=929.96s)]
*  I think that's one of the areas that we really worry about. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=934.4399999999999s)]
*  In 2016, we used to track this, and you would see people actually have conversations with [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  just bots. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=941.52s)]
*  That was in 2016, and they're literally arguing or they're promoting their cause and they're [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=943.0s)]
*  having an interactive conversation, and it's like there's nobody even behind the thing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=949.68s)]
*  I think it's pretty easy for people to get wrapped up into that's real or there's a narrative [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=954.4s)]
*  that we want to get behind. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=958.68s)]
*  A lot of it can be driven and has been driven by other nation states. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=962.04s)]
*  What we've seen in the past, we've spent a lot of time researching this with our CrowdTrack [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=966.64s)]
*  Intelligence team, is it's a little bit like a pebble in a pond. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=971.48s)]
*  You'll take a topic or you'll hear a topic, anything related to geopolitical environment, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=975.76s)]
*  and the pebble gets dropped in the pond and all these waves ripple out. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=982.36s)]
*  That's this amplification that takes place through the whole social network. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=986.44s)]
*  If now in 2024, with the ability to create deep fakes, and some of our internal guys [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=992.32s)]
*  have made some funny spoof videos with me in it just to show me how scary it is, and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  it's like, okay, that looks and sounds exactly like me. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1004.16s)]
*  You could not tell that it was not me in the video. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1007.88s)]
*  I think that's one of the areas that I really get concerned about. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1010.12s)]
*  There's always concern about infrastructure and those sort of things. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1014.16s)]
*  I think those areas, a lot of it is still paper voting and like some of it isn't, but [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1017.16s)]
*  I think it's how you create the false narrative to get people to do things that a nation state [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1023.24s)]
*  wants them to do. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1029.44s)]
*  That's the area that really concerns me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1030.44s)]
*  Would you be willing to share some of those deep fake files? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1032.0s)]
*  I probably wouldn't. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1034.8s)]
*  I think we'd love to have them on screen if possible. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1036.44s)]
*  I'm going to put that in the shredder. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1038.84s)]
*  Because CrowdStrike famously came in and investigated the DNC breach in 2016, identified Russia, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1041.8s)]
*  two Russian actors as infiltrating their systems. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1051.0s)]
*  Russia's always top of mind for election threats. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1055.12s)]
*  Do you personally or does CrowdStrike see them as the top threat to be active in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1058.2s)]
*  election, or is it too hard to say, too early to say at this point? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1064.16s)]
*  I think it's too hard, too early. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1067.6399999999999s)]
*  Certainly if you look at Russia, China, like I said, Iran, there's robust capabilities [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1069.12s)]
*  in those areas and each of these groups have their own methods and techniques and motivations [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1074.1599999999999s)]
*  in what they're looking for. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  We'll see how it unfolds. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1082.04s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of research and a lot of eyes on it trying to understand [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  what's happening. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1087.56s)]
*  My hope, and I know the social media platforms have put some effort into trying to identify [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  these sort of things and deal with it, but it's a little bit of whack-a-mole. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1095.2399999999998s)]
*  There's only so many things they can do, but I think a big part would be, and there's some [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1099.16s)]
*  technologies that they have already to try to identify these AI-generated, this content, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1104.64s)]
*  whether it's voice content, you've seen some of the phone calls and videos to sway voters. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1110.5600000000002s)]
*  Hopefully there's better prevention technology in place around that. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1117.0400000000002s)]
*  Just maybe one more question, and if there's any audience questions, we'll go to you guys [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1120.76s)]
*  and you can just raise your hand and Michael will come. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  I believe you guys call them Vanguard Pandas, but the US government has sort of adopted [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1128.48s)]
*  the Volt Typhoon moniker. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1132.9199999999998s)]
*  Chinese threat actor that's seemingly getting in all sorts of US critical infrastructure, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1134.32s)]
*  not for espionage purposes, but to pre-position, as government officials have said, for a potential [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1138.84s)]
*  disruptive attack or attacks on our infrastructure, perhaps ahead of a conflict over Taiwan. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1145.6799999999998s)]
*  This is very serious. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1152.32s)]
*  I feel like the level of rhetoric I'm hearing from these officials is sort of, in some ways, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1153.56s)]
*  unprecedented about a cyber threat. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1158.76s)]
*  You guys have tracked this threat actor. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1162.32s)]
*  What can you tell us about how serious this is? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1164.24s)]
*  What are your concerns, and are we doing enough to sort of respond to this Chinese APT threat? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1166.32s)]
*  The threat actor is very capable, and the threat is real. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  It should be taken seriously. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1178.24s)]
*  If you look at the critical infrastructures, they target it, whether it's power, water, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1179.56s)]
*  wind, shipping, etc., it goes across the board. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1187.28s)]
*  It's something you have to really be concerned about, and I think the US government is right [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1191.72s)]
*  to be concerned about. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1194.84s)]
*  What we've seen is really what's called operational preparation of the environment, OPE, and that [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1195.84s)]
*  is the staging of capabilities in these OT environments. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1201.6s)]
*  The thought is, if there is some level of outbreak in Taiwan and China, that some of [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1208.44s)]
*  these capabilities could be activated, which would greatly impact the response of the US [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1216.28s)]
*  government. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1222.56s)]
*  You have to be concerned about it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1223.56s)]
*  It's real. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1224.96s)]
*  We've been involved. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1225.96s)]
*  We've tracked and seen these threat actors and helped some of the organizations respond [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1227.2s)]
*  to it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1232.88s)]
*  At this point, I think the government has done a decent job of raising the flag, and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1234.7600000000002s)]
*  it's something that we have to be concerned with, but it's different. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1239.6000000000001s)]
*  China spent a lot of time stealing data and copying it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1243.8000000000002s)]
*  This is not stealing data. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1247.3200000000002s)]
*  This is preparing the environment to activate it at some point in the future. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1248.5600000000002s)]
*  Are there any questions in the audience? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1253.1200000000001s)]
*  Right here in the front. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1256.48s)]
*  Front row in the middle. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1257.48s)]
*  Just give the mic for recording purposes. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1261.08s)]
*  I could use my marine voice. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1265.08s)]
*  If you could just identify yourself as well. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1268.08s)]
*  There's a global battle going on around chips, and right now China has more plants under [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1271.24s)]
*  construction than anyone else in the world, and they're investing significantly more than [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1277.04s)]
*  the US in chip production. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1282.16s)]
*  What do we need to do to stay ahead of the race and continue to lead in that area besides [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1285.8000000000002s)]
*  sanctions? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1292.64s)]
*  How do we stay ahead? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1293.64s)]
*  I think it comes down to dollars and cents. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1296.88s)]
*  I'm not an expert, and I really won't comment one way or another on a chips act, but I think [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1299.64s)]
*  there's been some recognition that we have to have more of these capabilities in the [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1304.24s)]
*  US. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  But when you look at how long it takes to get a manufacturing facility set up and just [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  the approvals, the regulations, the cost, it's a slog here as opposed to in some other [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1314.08s)]
*  place like China. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1319.4799999999998s)]
*  It's much easier to throw things up. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1320.4799999999998s)]
*  They're not dealing with all the environmental impacts and agencies and studies and protests [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1321.9599999999998s)]
*  where these manufacturing facilities come up. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1328.04s)]
*  I think some of it is a bit of our own doing, but at the end of the day, how do we make [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1331.9199999999998s)]
*  more cost effective to be able to get these manufacturing plants built here in the US? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1337.92s)]
*  And you're seeing some of them. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1344.92s)]
*  You're seeing some of them in Arizona, some big manufacturing facilities. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1345.92s)]
*  But it takes time, and I think there's always a lag in terms of what chips are being made. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1349.5200000000002s)]
*  We saw with COVID, the smallest little chips that nobody wanted to make were the ones that [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1354.44s)]
*  was impacting everybody. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1359.0400000000002s)]
*  Couldn't get a car, couldn't get a key because the little chip that goes in the key was made [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1360.5200000000002s)]
*  in China or somewhere else, and it was impacting the supply chain. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1365.24s)]
*  So whenever you have to ask the question, how, just follow the dollars and how do you [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1368.4s)]
*  make it effective for businesses to do something here? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPE_YutvuQ4&t=1373.36s)]
