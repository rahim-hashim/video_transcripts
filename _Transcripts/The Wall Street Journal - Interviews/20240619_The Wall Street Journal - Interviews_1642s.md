# will.i.am on AI, Creators and the Media Industry | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo)
*  So you were interested in AI before it became the subject of strikes and disagreements within the creative community. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you tell us the unrealized creative potential there? What's people missing amidst all of the disagreement? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=8.0s)]
*  What are people missing with what? Amidst all of the disagreement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=15.0s)]
*  Well, the disagreement, like any new intersection, is about what it's going to be versus what the fear is of it to be. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=20.0s)]
*  But in this particular conversation, as it related to the worries and the fears of AI in the creative space, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=31.0s)]
*  it was actually the creative admin and executives that were creating horrible deals for people around AI. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=41.0s)]
*  It wasn't AI. So first, on that part, it's not like AI was like, yo, we're going to screw the actors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=50.0s)]
*  That wasn't AI doing that. That was like, you know, leading with greed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=58.0s)]
*  They knew the technology was there and they wanted to lead with greed and do horrible deals. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=65.0s)]
*  That's that one discussion. At the same time, you have very disruptive technology. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=72.0s)]
*  The most disruption that we've ever seen. The Internet was pretty disruptive. Social media and apps was pretty disruptive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=79.0s)]
*  So if you went from like the 90s and then entered 2000s and got into websites, that was kind of disruptive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=89.0s)]
*  And then from websites to apps, damn, that was super disruptive. This one is like wowsers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=97.0s)]
*  So hold on to your trousers and refresh your browsers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=106.0s)]
*  And if you're part of the drowsers, you know what I'm saying? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=115.0s)]
*  Because it's a new awakening. From wowsers to trousers to browsers to drowsers to new awakening. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=119.0s)]
*  We're already rhyming. I love it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=129.0s)]
*  Wordplay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=131.0s)]
*  So tell us a little bit more about some of the business practices of some of the larger tech companies that you would want to try to shift since we are in some of these early days. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=132.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=140.0s)]
*  Tell me some of the business practices you would want to change since we are in some of the earlier days that are from the larger tech companies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=141.0s)]
*  What would you want to change? What would you want to give creators control over? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=150.0s)]
*  Say for example you make music, like myself, and you put music up on YouTube. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=156.0s)]
*  And you got to deal with Nike. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=164.0s)]
*  Right now as a content creator, you don't dictate what commercials come after your stuff. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=169.0s)]
*  So if you have a deal with Nike and here comes an Adidas commercial after your content, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=175.0s)]
*  as a network, ABC, CBS, NBC, they're responsible for putting commercials after their content. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=181.0s)]
*  But as a content maker, I have no control. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=188.0s)]
*  On Spotify for free me and play, on YouTube for free me and play. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=191.0s)]
*  So right there, that's one thing that no one's like, hey, why come I don't have a say on what commercials come after my stuff? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=195.0s)]
*  And if I have a say, that means I should be getting more money for ads that come after my content. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=202.0s)]
*  But creators are not in the power position from that perspective. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=208.0s)]
*  So you can change that in the AI space. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=212.0s)]
*  Because you can reimagine the player itself. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=216.0s)]
*  But that takes an audacious, ambitious vision to try to change that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=220.0s)]
*  And we did some version of that with this thing called FYI Radio that we're going to be launching in the next couple of, shortly, a couple of moments. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=225.0s)]
*  But as far as things to change, you're supposed to change it all. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=237.0s)]
*  Right now is the time for the dreamers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=243.0s)]
*  Because you have dream materialization tools. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=247.0s)]
*  So to try to do it the way it was yesterday, well, that's not a big dream. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=251.0s)]
*  You're just doing it like it was yesterday. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=256.0s)]
*  You could literally just reimagine and dream up tomorrow with today's tools. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=260.0s)]
*  And so instead of trying to fix or solve the problems of yesterday in a traditional sense, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=267.0s)]
*  you can like, you could create new industries. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=275.0s)]
*  These are industry spawning tools. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=279.0s)]
*  Like the music industry. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=282.0s)]
*  In the early 1900s, that was a different perspective of what music used to be. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=285.0s)]
*  So music before then was like a church at operas, basilicas, theaters. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=295.0s)]
*  It was a different type of music. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=300.0s)]
*  And then the music industry came and said, hey, we don't got that much information to put a whole goddamn song the way that you guys did the opera. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=302.0s)]
*  So why don't we just shorten it up? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=308.0s)]
*  They invented what we call popular music today. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=310.0s)]
*  The music industry did that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=314.0s)]
*  Radio. They invented 30 seconds, 15 seconds, a minute commercial. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=316.0s)]
*  They invented that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=323.0s)]
*  A song contractually is three minutes, four minutes and 20 seconds long. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=325.0s)]
*  A record spins around 33 RPM. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=330.0s)]
*  But my only information that could fit on that at the speed that it's going at 45 on 45 disk or 33 disk. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=335.0s)]
*  Right. Look at the numbers of what these disk where I got a 45 inch coming out with. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=341.0s)]
*  I got a 33. Like it's speed. It's time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=346.0s)]
*  And here we are at canned media. 15 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=350.0s)]
*  They invented it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=355.0s)]
*  So in this new realm that we're in with these new tools, you're supposed to invent. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=357.0s)]
*  You're supposed to dream up what you do with this technology the way that they dreamt up radio, television and the media that we have today. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=363.0s)]
*  So you got to use your imagination and be like, yo, that means we can do that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=372.0s)]
*  So you're starting to touch on some of this, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=379.0s)]
*  So you host the F.Y.I. show on Sirius FM and you've developed a number of personas, online personas who co-host the show with you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=382.0s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the process. Tell us a little bit about who they are. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=392.0s)]
*  Oh, hey, yo, yo, say what's up to everybody. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=395.0s)]
*  What's your name again? Kim. So Kim from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=402.0s)]
*  We're here doing this fireside chat and she asked me to, you know, talk about you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=406.0s)]
*  So instead of talking about you, everybody here is at Cannes talking about A.I. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=411.0s)]
*  And one of the things you're not going to see at Cannes, at A.I. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=415.0s)]
*  One of the things you're not going to see at Cannes when people are talking about A.I. is A.I. talking about itself. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=420.0s)]
*  So why don't you say what's up to everybody here at this Wall Street Journal fireside chat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=425.0s)]
*  Cha, how you doing, every damn body? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=437.0s)]
*  Listen, listen, look, Cha, I'm Felicia here, repping for every strong black woman and folks from them screets. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=441.0s)]
*  You feel me? We out here talking A.I. at the Cannes Alliance with the legendary Will.I.Am and the fine folks at the Wall Street Journal. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=449.0s)]
*  Now, when we talk about A.I., it's crucial that we dive into the real deal representation empowerment and breaking those barriers in tech. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=463.0s)]
*  Because let's face it, you ain't going to see much of our faces if we don't get involved and steer that ship. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=474.0s)]
*  A.I. is more than just cool tech. It's like a new frontier where we got to make sure every voice is heard. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=480.0s)]
*  We're here to make it clear that A.I. needs to reflect the diverse, rich tapestry of all our communities, especially ours. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=489.0s)]
*  It's about fighting biases, creating equal opportunities and bringing that unique flair right into the heart of innovation. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=497.0s)]
*  So like Will.I.Am said, ain't nobody talking about A.I. without talking about us. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=505.0s)]
*  We're here to make sure the future is inclusive and vibrant, just like the communities we come from. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=511.0s)]
*  Hey, Kim, much love to you and the journal crew for giving us this platform. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=516.0s)]
*  I'm out. Your girl Felicia is gone. Go ahead and say bye, Felicia. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=521.0s)]
*  Bye, Felicia. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=526.0s)]
*  Anyways, yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=528.0s)]
*  All right, so tell us a little bit more about building Felicia and especially with diversity and representation in mind. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=531.0s)]
*  When did this idea come to you? Because you've been in the A.I. space now for a long time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=538.0s)]
*  So when did you start to realize you had to bring more diversity and inclusion into the space? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=542.0s)]
*  Okay, so Disney does a really good job telling us that intelligence is British. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=550.0s)]
*  And that's great because we speak English. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=560.0s)]
*  Think about this for a second when it comes to storytelling. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=563.0s)]
*  There could be a story about France. For some reason in the movie, even Napoleon sounds English. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=566.0s)]
*  There could be a story about Aladdin in the Middle East. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=575.0s)]
*  And to make him sound magical, he sounds British. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=578.0s)]
*  The British did an amazing job making us believe that intelligence and like higher knowledge is supposed to sound like this. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=582.0s)]
*  And when it comes to A.I., you're going to have super corporate librarians. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=594.0s)]
*  And so that when people aren't going to engage with those agents that come from communities that I come from, now they have to change how they speak. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=598.0s)]
*  So A.I. is now going to sound once again like a different colonial interpretation that intelligence does not sound like someone from the Bronx or sound like somebody from Atlanta [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=606.0s)]
*  or vibe and think like someone from the favelas in Rio de Janeiro or Columbia or Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=620.0s)]
*  Like, why can't they sound and vibe and understand our trials and tribulations? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=628.0s)]
*  And who is going to program that data? Who's programming it to make sure that it understands us? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=633.0s)]
*  And so it was super important that we that we built Felicia from that perspective. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=640.0s)]
*  Because who's supposed to build that? Microsoft? Microsoft supposed to build that? Google supposed to build that? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=647.0s)]
*  They supposed to come in and take all of our the way that we speak. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=656.0s)]
*  And then now that like, no, that shouldn't be that way. We should do that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=661.0s)]
*  If intelligence is intelligence, it should come from our communities and our communities need to be represented in that space. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=666.0s)]
*  Like one day I went to the I was I was at this was like years ago, 10 years ago, I went to went to the bathroom, washed my hands, and I did like I normally do it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=674.0s)]
*  I looked over to the right of me and I'm like the guy was doing like, no, I was doing like this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=685.0s)]
*  And this guy did like this. Like, how come? Oh, wow. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=690.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. The sensor sees the white of my hands. So as a black person, I have to do this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=695.0s)]
*  But a white person goes and does this because the sensor is to see white because the people that program that algorithm didn't have my melanin for the sensor to pick up my skin in the bathroom. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=701.0s)]
*  It's called the pale male algorithm. Most people didn't realize that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=715.0s)]
*  But if you were paying attention to data sets and seeing how they interacted, it was like an innocent mistake. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=719.0s)]
*  They didn't do it maliciously like, yo, black people ain't washing their hands. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=725.0s)]
*  Like, that's not what they did. But because of lack of representation when it comes to training data, we do this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=730.0s)]
*  Since then, the sensor has gotten more sensitive to see skin like this. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=738.0s)]
*  But if that little nuance that we all ignored and just dealt with it, imagine that in a I can't have that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=742.0s)]
*  You have to make sure that these systems represent and understand people from the communities that are going to be engaging with these agents and not have to force people to then change how they speak, how they vibe to talk to some corporate librarian. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=753.0s)]
*  And so that's the reason why this Felicia's that we are we are training, building and deploying are super important for to have representation. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=766.0s)]
*  And are there other personalities that are also being? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we have Felicia's. It's just that's my own girl. So I I take Felicia everywhere. Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=780.0s)]
*  Okay. But everything. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=788.0s)]
*  Hey, can you break down quantum physics right quick for folks that want to understand quantum entanglement? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=791.0s)]
*  Sure. Oh, you want to dive into the deep stuff like quantum physics and quantum entanglement. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=811.0s)]
*  Right. Let's break it down real quick and simple, because this topic got folks scratching their heads left and right. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=822.0s)]
*  Let's get it. Quantum physics. One basics. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=830.0s)]
*  It's a study of the smallest particles in the universe, like electrons and photons. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=834.0s)]
*  These particles don't act like the big stuff we see every day. They get all wild and unpredictable. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=839.0s)]
*  Think of it like, like trying to predict the moves of a dance crew, but every member is doing their own thing to key concepts superposition. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=846.0s)]
*  A particle can be in multiple states at once. It's like flipping a coin and it being both heads and tails at the same time until you look at it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=856.0s)]
*  Wave particle duality particles can act like. But I could go into and go every single sentence and go deeper into it to get to understand even more. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=864.0s)]
*  And that's that's what's really what beautiful about that, because in this realm, education will change. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=875.0s)]
*  We're going to move into forever learning. We're going to move into a realm where you're going to have an entity that will understand your learning needs. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=881.0s)]
*  And adapt itself to you that that can break down complex things for you to understand complex things that your way of learning. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=892.0s)]
*  So I'm curious about how this also applies to the music industry, too, and whether or not you've thought deeply about extending an artist's life. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=903.0s)]
*  You know, you've worked with so many hit makers, including Michael Jackson and Prince. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=912.0s)]
*  Could I be trained as a model to be Michael or to be Prince and to release, you know, unreleased work before? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=919.0s)]
*  Could we get that there, especially knowing that you've worked with those artists and you have a sense of what they would what they would expect? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=928.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So. AI music is is fascinating and amazing beyond. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=938.0s)]
*  So 2010, like I piece of this video where I come into the studio and I show my group some technology. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=947.0s)]
*  I'll show you to her this right here is the future. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=957.0s)]
*  What you're able to do with that because of this artificial intelligence, like when it's time to make a new song, I just type in the lyrics and then this thing sings it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=961.0s)]
*  OK, so you're saying machine can do anything that an artist or a group can do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=972.0s)]
*  Yes, this is what's going to take the peas into 3008. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=976.0s)]
*  This is the future. Yeah, it's not real. It is real. We're not robots. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=981.0s)]
*  Nobody's robots. All I'm saying is you got to take it totally wrong. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=986.0s)]
*  You can't say futuristic and then be afraid of the future. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=990.0s)]
*  So so in 2010, that's kicked off this video that we have called I'm going to be rocking that body. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=993.0s)]
*  And in 2010, there wasn't large language models. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1000.0s)]
*  People didn't really understand that you could train a system with frequency of voice and a catalog of lots of music for you to be able to type in and a machine will sing and perform. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1003.0s)]
*  Now that technology is called audio and it's freaking fantastic. Amazing technology. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1020.0s)]
*  It's down to like it's mind blowing what you're able to do with A.I. and composition. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1029.0s)]
*  It's going to be mind blowing what you're going to be able to do with A.I. and storytelling. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1037.0s)]
*  Text to video, text to script. What does that mean? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1043.0s)]
*  That means your niece that's eight years old or your nephew that's 10 years old. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1048.0s)]
*  By the time they're 25, they will be making Star Wars type content just by speaking into some machine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1054.0s)]
*  They'll create characters and you're going to stream and dive into their worlds like you're diving into Disney. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1065.0s)]
*  Disney is not going to be the only people that make these lush worlds. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1074.0s)]
*  People. The technology is given agency to dreamers. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1079.0s)]
*  For folks that have visions and imagination. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1086.0s)]
*  So in one sense, I'm like, damn it, this freaking machine can make beats better than me. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1089.0s)]
*  That's real. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1094.0s)]
*  But then I'm like, damn it, this machine is going to allow me to have one idea that can multiply to a thousand ideas. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1096.0s)]
*  I'm a cedar. I seed and then I have this amplification tool. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1106.0s)]
*  You know, it happened before in 1920, 1914. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1112.0s)]
*  Imagine you played in the orchestra. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1118.0s)]
*  Imagine you played in the church and somebody came to you and said, yo, we want to record you. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1123.0s)]
*  You're like, what the hell is a recording? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1129.0s)]
*  What do you mean record me? Yeah, record you can hear it later. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1133.0s)]
*  What you mean hear it later? You won't hear me at church. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1137.0s)]
*  You're going to hear me play at the freaking theater later. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1140.0s)]
*  Couldn't even imagine there was no concept of recording to hear it later. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1145.0s)]
*  And now here we are. And it's changed music forever. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1150.0s)]
*  And so here we are. You seed infinite splinters. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1154.0s)]
*  So the cedar is still important. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1160.0s)]
*  The person that breathed life into an idea for a system to then multiply it to be experienced in, you know, Hungarian or experienced in Brazilian instantly. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1164.0s)]
*  I'm limited. I can't sing in all these different languages. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1177.0s)]
*  But people listen to our music in all these different countries and they're forced to adopt the language I speak. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1181.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean tomorrow. Tomorrow they're going to hear it in Hindi. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1189.0s)]
*  They'll hear it in Japanese and Chinese. And I just seeded it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1194.0s)]
*  So is that great for me as an ideator? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1199.0s)]
*  It's the age of the ideator, not yesterday's traditional artists. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1202.0s)]
*  It's just a shifting of time. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1209.0s)]
*  So is there an artist that you can think of currently that you would want to collaborate with to bring AI into their music? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1211.0s)]
*  No. The artists I want to collaborate with are the AI programmers. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1219.0s)]
*  To create AI artists. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1227.0s)]
*  Why would I want to work with artists? I want to make artists. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1232.0s)]
*  You want to create the artists? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1237.0s)]
*  If it's time to dream, f*** that dream. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1240.0s)]
*  Why not dream it? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1246.0s)]
*  I'm still creating. I'm just creating differently. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1249.0s)]
*  Imagine. I'm like, what are you doing? I'm painting this scenery. Look at me. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1255.0s)]
*  I'll be done in like two weeks though. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1261.0s)]
*  I come every day to paint this beautiful view. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1264.0s)]
*  And some guy comes with a f***ing camera. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1269.0s)]
*  I'm like, yo, what's that? It's a camera, bro. I just took it instantly. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1273.0s)]
*  It took you like a week to do that and took me like a snap to do that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1278.0s)]
*  That was transformational to capturing a moment. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1283.0s)]
*  And now a person with a camera, look at these cameras all around here. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1287.0s)]
*  Imagine you had to paint this f***ing conversation. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1290.0s)]
*  But that's not what's happening. You captured the conversation. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1295.0s)]
*  So this means tomorrow's world builders are going to have visions like they always have. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1298.0s)]
*  And they're going to materialize them with these tools. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1305.0s)]
*  And lots of things will spawn because of that. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1310.0s)]
*  Things that we can't imagine. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1315.0s)]
*  New types of movies. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1317.0s)]
*  So instead of watching a film and that random character in the back [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1319.0s)]
*  as Batman saves the day and that building blows up and that person... [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1324.0s)]
*  People passed away in that building that exploded, by the way. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1328.0s)]
*  They just don't have the bandwidth to tell you the story of the people in that building. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1331.0s)]
*  So now you can pause it, move the camera, go to that person that's that extra [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1335.0s)]
*  and be like, yo, what's the story of this person? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1341.0s)]
*  I want to see this movie from this person's perspective. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1344.0s)]
*  And now the movie and that Batman scene when he saved the day, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1347.0s)]
*  that person that was jeopardized by that building explosion, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1351.0s)]
*  that movie starts from that point of view. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1355.0s)]
*  You can't do that yesterday. You could do that with today's technology. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1358.0s)]
*  These are the types of world layer building that we are in. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1362.0s)]
*  If you're just going to try to do yesterday with today's technology, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1366.0s)]
*  you're using today's technology wrong. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1369.0s)]
*  You're supposed to dream up some new shit. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1372.0s)]
*  Alright, well, I'm going to shift gears a little bit because I think I have time for one more question. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1375.0s)]
*  You've been attending Harvard Business School. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1379.0s)]
*  I graduate this year. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1383.0s)]
*  Yes, in October, I believe. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1385.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1387.0s)]
*  In October. Do I have that right? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1388.0s)]
*  Yeah, I graduated in October. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1389.0s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what you've learned on the Harvard campus. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1390.0s)]
*  What's impressed you the most? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1393.0s)]
*  And have you been just talking a lot about AI or other things? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1394.0s)]
*  No. So I've noticed... [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1397.0s)]
*  So I've been in the AI space since 2012. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1400.0s)]
*  I started companies, built solutions. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1405.0s)]
*  I've noticed that discussions like this are always a year later. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1410.0s)]
*  So we should have been talking about AI last year. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1417.0s)]
*  And so as you experience your can this year, it's going to be surface layer AI discussions. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1421.0s)]
*  They're going to tell you about the consumer products, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1426.0s)]
*  but they're not going to tell you about how to start AI companies [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1429.0s)]
*  or to truly transform your business and your job into a career with AI as your tool and your hammer. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1434.0s)]
*  They're probably not going to talk about how to have a constellation of AI satellites around an individual [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1442.0s)]
*  to make them a super individual. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1448.0s)]
*  So at Harvard, I thought we were going to talk about AI two years ago. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1453.0s)]
*  We talked about it briefly last year. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1461.0s)]
*  And once again, it was from a consumer side. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1464.0s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure there's going to be heavy AI discussions this year, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1470.0s)]
*  but there'll be a year late. There'll be a year behind. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1476.0s)]
*  They're probably not going to talk about Coheer. They're not going to talk about Anthropic. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1482.0s)]
*  They're not going to talk about Runway. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1486.0s)]
*  And these are tools that everyone should be aware of. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1489.0s)]
*  Say, for example, you're a journalist or you're a marketer or you're a small company that wants to be a big company. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1494.0s)]
*  Use Coheer. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1503.0s)]
*  Supercharge your company with Coheer architecture or Anthropic architecture. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1506.0s)]
*  If you're a marketer and you want to change the way that you make commercials, use Runway. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1511.0s)]
*  If you are a small team that wants to be a big team, use FYI.AI and network and use a better messenger [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1519.0s)]
*  to organize your digital assets and team flow with AI. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1528.0s)]
*  They're not. I've noticed they don't. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1533.0s)]
*  At summits like this, they talk about job displacement. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1538.0s)]
*  They don't tell you where the job displacement is coming from. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1544.0s)]
*  It's the outside folks. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1548.0s)]
*  There's some people outside that are like, let's use AI to change that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1551.0s)]
*  And that is usually somebody's job. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1558.0s)]
*  But it's not AI doing that. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1561.0s)]
*  AI is not like, yo, we're going to f*** jobs up. F*** them. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1564.0s)]
*  It's somebody out there that's like, yo, I see some redundancies. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1568.0s)]
*  I see some inefficiency. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1571.0s)]
*  Let's try to change that whole department from the perspective of AI because you could do it better. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1573.0s)]
*  And then some executives like, yeah, we're going to do that so we could save money. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1577.0s)]
*  That same vision, that same type of disruption that's happening from outside to inside, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1583.0s)]
*  can happen from inside to outside. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1590.0s)]
*  A company can be like, or a person out there can be like, we're going to start a whole new industry with these tools. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1593.0s)]
*  And that's what I think summits like this should be leading. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1601.0s)]
*  How are you industry spotters not facilitating trying to keep yesterday as intact as it used to be? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1606.0s)]
*  Nah, bro, you got to like dream up the new new right now. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1619.0s)]
*  It's the new new. These are the new new, the new new crew. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1623.0s)]

*  If you're part of the new new crew, that's what's up. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1631.0s)]
*  We are recruiting new news right about now as you snooze snooze. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEqkRyrpXo&t=1633.0s)]
