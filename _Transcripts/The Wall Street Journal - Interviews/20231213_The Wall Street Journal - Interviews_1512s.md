**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw)
*  You recently announced your retirement from the Senate after 12 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=0.0s)]
*  What will you miss the most and what will you miss the least about being a United States [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=5.2s)]
*  Senator? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=9.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, the opportunity to make a change in the world or make a change in our country, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=10.52s)]
*  making change in my state, in my neighborhood, whatever, the opportunities are endless within [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=14.32s)]
*  the Senate, everything Congress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=18.92s)]
*  I've been a state legislator. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=21.32s)]
*  I've been a secretary of state of my state. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=22.64s)]
*  I've been governor of my state. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=24.28s)]
*  And I always tried to get to a position where I could do more. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=26.48s)]
*  So when I was one of a hundred and as a delegate, I thought, well, the state Senate is 34. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=29.56s)]
*  So I'm one of 34. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  I can help three times as much. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  If I become governor, I'd be one of one, could really do some some good stuff. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  The hard thing is for a governor to come into this position. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=40.64s)]
*  It's this very difficult transition because you're used to being on the front line like [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=42.92s)]
*  a CEO making decisions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=46.8s)]
*  And all of a sudden now you've got a whole cadre of people making. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=48.36s)]
*  So then you end up in seniority and one of a hundred again. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=52.32s)]
*  That was very discouraging. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=54.96s)]
*  But then so that was the thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=56.36s)]
*  It was most discouraging. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  I thought I made the worst mistake of my life to come to the Senate. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=59.24s)]
*  And then it took a while to get your footing and you have to have patience to job. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=63.0s)]
*  But then you can do one thing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=67.68s)]
*  I was able to basically pass lifetime benefits for minors who I've seen work for and died [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=68.72s)]
*  for and their families. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=73.78s)]
*  It was very rewarding. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=75.36s)]
*  I saw the 117th Congress as the most I think one of the most productive congresses we've [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=76.76s)]
*  ever had. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=81.56s)]
*  And we did it with the 50-50 Senate, which we've never done before. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=82.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  Why could we get so much accomplished in the absolute 50-50? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I think it came down to where those of us who think in the middle and those of us who [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=89.64s)]
*  want to work in a bipartisan way figured it's now or never. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=94.12s)]
*  Who are you going to blame? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  It's 50-50. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  It's as much their fault as it is our fault. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  So those of us that have always been myself, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=102.44s)]
*  and boom, boom, boom, and Mark Warner and some of them, we just decided we could do [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=107.16s)]
*  things and we did. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=111.4s)]
*  You also have been somewhat critical of the institution. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=113.64s)]
*  Do you think that the Senate is functional or is it a broken place? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=116.88s)]
*  Let me just say that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  I can do it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  I did the grid art. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  The grid art is kind of a raucous group of journalists and they invite you to it and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  want you to make fun of yourself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=129.08s)]
*  The only thing I said there, I said, people want to know why I'm retiring. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=130.08s)]
*  And I said, I go to a hostile work environment every day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=134.12s)]
*  You go to a hostile work environment with half the people there wanting to get you fired. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=137.8s)]
*  And I said, so how is it going to be productive? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=141.48s)]
*  And I said, just think about it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  If you had a work environment like mine, would you want to go back? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  And that's the hard, but that's not the truth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=149.76s)]
*  I believe in term limits. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=151.64s)]
*  I've really come to, you know, let me tell you why I believe in term limits. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=153.76s)]
*  I was given a, I always have, go around the state of West Virginia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  I was down in southern West Virginia and it was a town hall meeting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=159.92s)]
*  There might have been a couple hundred people there, really a great turnout. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  And a lady stood up, a little old lady in the back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  She was very nice, elderly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=167.88s)]
*  And she says, Joe, I really believe in term limits might make things better. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=169.04s)]
*  So I try to give her all the reasons why term limits might not be a good thing for her to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=172.72s)]
*  think about because you're losing a lot of the expertise people have. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=176.6s)]
*  Boom, boom. I went through all of the things I could do through the whole load of hay on her. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=180.0s)]
*  And she looks at me, she says, Joe, just think about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=184.84s)]
*  If there was term limits, maybe we'd get one good term out of you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=186.88s)]
*  I could, I had no comeback. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=190.2s)]
*  So from that day on, I've been for term limits because it's the honest to God truth. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=191.44s)]
*  I think there should be one 18 year term for Supreme Court, one six year term for president, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=195.92s)]
*  two six year terms for Senate and six two year terms for House. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=201.4s)]
*  Period. That's enough. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=204.16s)]
*  Well, you you also, I believe, made a gridiron joke about being the last Democrat ever to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=207.24s)]
*  come from West Virginia. Do you think that a Democrat will ever win West Virginia? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Not in my lifetime. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=215.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't see that happening. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=217.76s)]
*  I think our change, our state has changed so much. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=219.12s)]
*  The D brand is basically the branding. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=221.6s)]
*  People are forced to pick sides. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  And in West Virginia, they picked a side when they felt the Democrats had left him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  It really wasn't for the working people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=229.56s)]
*  Give them a chance. Overregulated him to the point to where they they the whole slogan of war on coal transitions coming. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=231.0s)]
*  I mean, you have to you have to embrace transition, but make sure there's something to replace what you're transitioning from, too. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=239.72s)]
*  And they never gave me an opportunity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=246.52s)]
*  They just said, well, I'm sorry, it's over. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=247.72s)]
*  And they start giving work extensions. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=250.08s)]
*  You know, we're going to give you if you're trained for another. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=252.56s)]
*  I said, guys, come on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=254.76s)]
*  You want to give basically a glorified unemployment benefit in disguise that is training when there's no jobs you're training for. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  OK, you got to have some investments and some industry coming. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  So I will say with what we have done in the hundred seventeen Congress, we've created a lot of opportunity throughout the country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=268.72s)]
*  And most of it's going in rural areas where there's a lot of energy and people have had hard times. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=274.4s)]
*  And I think you're going to see a revitalization. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=279.72s)]
*  And that's why the economy is kind of held together. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=281.96s)]
*  No one ever envisioned the type of investments we have coming from all over the world coming to America. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=284.68s)]
*  I know that firsthand. Last year, I was overseas and I had President Macron and Chancellor Schultz come at me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  And I mean, they were rabid thinking that, my God, the IRA took everything from them and took all their investments. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=296.68s)]
*  And I said, guys, the difference of us and you, I can assure you, we never put that bill together thinking, how could we help hurt our allies? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  We just couldn't help you when Putin declared used energy as a weapon against you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  And we had to produce more. We weren't. This administration didn't want to produce any fossil. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  And without being energy secured, it's pretty hard to help yourself, let alone help your allies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  So that's really how the bill came about. That's an energy security bill. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=325.72s)]
*  The president calls it an environmental bill. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=329.72s)]
*  But we're producing more energy than we ever have in the history of our country right now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=331.8s)]
*  And he'll never talk about that. We put $230 billion of that bill towards debt reduction. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  He'll never talk about that. The things that it did good. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=340.36s)]
*  I've gotten the hell beat out of me for the things they think it did bad. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=343.88s)]
*  But the only thing bad about it is how they're trying to interpret this piece of legislation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=347.08s)]
*  They're trying to implement something they never passed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=351.72s)]
*  So I'm holding their feet to the fire. But there's a couple of things we can do and you all can help us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  What needs to be done to stop this runaway train as far as overspending? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=359.0s)]
*  21 years in a row we've spent more than we've taken in. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=363.32s)]
*  Nobody can survive under those conditions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=365.88s)]
*  When I got there it was $13 trillion of debt. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=368.52s)]
*  I know I'm going off on things because I got to go back and vote. They're waiting on me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=370.68s)]
*  But anyway, right at $34 trillion, $33.826 this morning. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=374.6s)]
*  And there's no signs of it letting up. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=379.88s)]
*  Let me tell you how the system works. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=381.72s)]
*  And this is where you all really could hold everyone's feet to the fire. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=383.08s)]
*  I might be gone, but there's a way that corrects some of this stuff. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  When we pass a bill and the C bill gives us a score right, wrong, or indifferent, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=389.64s)]
*  and we pass a bill and everything, no matter who's in charge, they want this, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=393.0s)]
*  whether it's tax credits or tax cuts or more services or whatever. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=395.96s)]
*  They put that and CBO scores it and says, okay, to do all the things you want, that'll be $690 billion. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=400.6s)]
*  And there's a pay for. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=406.6s)]
*  And you're thinking, okay, it's going to take 10 years of revenue to pay for 10 years of spending. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=407.96s)]
*  There's nobody that puts a stop gap. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=414.52s)]
*  And every bill should basically say, if this becomes very, very popular [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=416.84s)]
*  and there's more people participating in what CBO anticipated, you'll run out of money in four years. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=421.64s)]
*  We've been basically, the spending authority goes on for 10, money runs out in four. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  How do you pay for it? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=431.32s)]
*  Debt financing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=432.44s)]
*  So if you want to know how we accumulated so much debt so quick, that's it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  The other thing that kills us is basically when a bill is passed, all the best intentions, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=437.32s)]
*  it goes back to the agencies that have jurisdiction. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  So if it's energy, it's DOE. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=447.24s)]
*  If it's environmental, it's EPA and on, then you have interior and on and on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=449.08s)]
*  They interpret how the bill, they're supposed to interpret that for rules. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=453.88s)]
*  And if they put temporary rules out, temporary rules can just destroy you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=458.04s)]
*  because there are no hurry at all to put permanent rules out. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=461.64s)]
*  Now permanent rules is where you really catch you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=466.12s)]
*  But if you basically put your business model with temporary rules, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=468.2s)]
*  permanent comes out and just beats the living crap out of you, you're screwed. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=471.72s)]
*  That's when you can sue. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=475.48s)]
*  So they'll be basically temporary rules can go on for years. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=476.6s)]
*  So I would say this, Treasury cannot put any tax credits, incentives, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=480.20000000000005s)]
*  or anything that we're doing, grants or whatever, until permanent rules come out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=484.76000000000005s)]
*  Those are two things. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  If you all would just hang on to those two things, it changes the direction of the country. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=491.24s)]
*  I want to go back to something you said because you mentioned American energy production. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=495.24s)]
*  And it sounded like what you were saying, correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=501.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that the president has been afraid to talk about the fact that American energy production? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=505.0s)]
*  Totally afraid, scared to death. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=509.8s)]
*  Is he afraid of the environmental left? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=511.72s)]
*  He's got the crap out of him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=513.16s)]
*  Yeah, the environmentalists, and they're all my friends, I know them, we just disagree. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=514.2s)]
*  I said you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=518.44s)]
*  You can innovate it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=521.96s)]
*  You can't eliminate it, nobody will follow you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=523.32s)]
*  They just won't. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=525.4s)]
*  If they have energy laying in their backyard, they're going to use it the same as we did. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=526.04s)]
*  But if you innovate it with technology to use that energy you have laying there, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=529.24s)]
*  much cleaner than we've ever done it before, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=532.36s)]
*  we're producing more energy today cleaner than we've ever done in our history. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=534.76s)]
*  We'll be at 4.6 billion barrels of oil. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=537.64s)]
*  We're basically 37 trillion cubic feet of gas and we'll have 13 and a half billion cubic feet of LNG. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=539.88s)]
*  2016 we were zero LNG. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=545.64s)]
*  We're going to go to 25 billion. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=547.88s)]
*  We've replaced everything Russia was, they were depending upon Russia for. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=549.56s)]
*  So we're going to help Europe to that point. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=553.16s)]
*  They never have to go back to Russian, you know, Russian energy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=554.6s)]
*  So he just can't get there. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=558.52s)]
*  I mean, the administration has been pushed so far left. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  They're all good people. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=563.88s)]
*  I know they're well intended, but they're just going in the wrong direction. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=564.92s)]
*  So when we wrote the IRA, me and my staff, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=567.88s)]
*  none of you ever knew we were even writing the damn bill for March on [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=570.76s)]
*  because I got the crap beat out of me killing the BBB. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=573.56s)]
*  And I wasn't going to go back down that road again. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  But when this bill here, when I saw Ukraine, what they were doing to Russia, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=579.24s)]
*  I mean what Russia was doing to Ukraine, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=582.76s)]
*  I knew we were in a heck of a problem because I knew that Europe was going to be our greatest allies, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=584.76s)]
*  but they're going to be in trouble. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=589.16s)]
*  And if the superpower of the world can help your allies, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=590.84s)]
*  they're willing to fight and die with you. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=594.92s)]
*  They're in big problems. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=596.28s)]
*  And that's what I was afraid of, that they would get energy in all the wrong places. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=597.24s)]
*  So we had to jump in and do something. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=600.84s)]
*  Knowing the administration doesn't want to go with fossil at all. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=602.92s)]
*  So what we did, I wrote to Bill, we tied everything. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=606.12s)]
*  They cannot put a wind farm out in the Gulf or offshore [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=608.84s)]
*  unless we're extracting the resources we have there. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=612.12s)]
*  They can't put wind or solar on BLM land, which is 200, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=614.92s)]
*  I think about 270 million acres we own, you and I and everybody in America. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=618.04s)]
*  They can't do anything there unless we're extracting the minerals that we have. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=622.36s)]
*  So I said, you want to balance? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=625.9599999999999s)]
*  Fine. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=627.24s)]
*  We want the energy that we need today, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=627.88s)]
*  and we should invest in the energy that we want carbonless in the future. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=629.88s)]
*  So you can walk and chew gum, and we're doing it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=635.7199999999999s)]
*  MS. MCENANY Let's talk about you some more. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=637.48s)]
*  In your retirement announcement, you said you were going to be traveling the country, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=641.24s)]
*  speaking out to see if there's an interest in creating a movement [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=644.68s)]
*  to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  MR. BENTON I heard you. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=649.88s)]
*  MS. MCENANY What does that mean? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  Have you started doing it? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=652.8399999999999s)]
*  How is it going? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=654.3599999999999s)]
*  MR. BENTON I start in January. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=655.0s)]
*  I'll be two months on the road. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=656.12s)]
*  And all we're trying to do is just mobilize people like myself [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=657.8s)]
*  who feel like they're homeless, politically homeless. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't recognize a Democratic party that I have a D by my name. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=665.0s)]
*  I have a lot of Republicans who don't recognize a Republican party [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  that have R's by their name. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=670.52s)]
*  So the grand old party, and I guess the blue dog Democrats, they're homeless. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  And I hear it every day. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  So I don't know if there's out there. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=676.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if there's a movement. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=677.64s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=678.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if there's enough people to say, oh, well, what the hell, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=679.7199999999999s)]
*  I'll just vote for this person. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=681.7199999999999s)]
*  We're making you all pick a side. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  And the options aren't real good. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=684.76s)]
*  And everyone's giving us feedback that they don't want to go with the options [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=686.76s)]
*  they might have. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=689.8s)]
*  And about Super Tuesday, you're going to know exactly, for sure, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=690.8399999999999s)]
*  what options you have. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=694.04s)]
*  And for 150 to 160 million people, it'll be vote in November. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=695.7199999999999s)]
*  And you have 60 to 70 percent of each respective party that has a duopoly [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=700.44s)]
*  of a business giving you a choice you don't want. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=704.04s)]
*  It's not a good situation. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=707.16s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=709.48s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=710.36s)]
*  Are we going to see you on a national ticket? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=710.76s)]
*  I don't. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  I haven't made any of those predictions. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=714.2s)]
*  And the reason I won't make a prediction, what I can tell you is there might be a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=715.64s)]
*  movement, there might not. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=719.64s)]
*  That depends. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=721.48s)]
*  I will not be a spoiler. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=722.6800000000001s)]
*  I've never been a spoiler at anything. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=723.88s)]
*  I get into something. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  I get into win. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=726.44s)]
*  The difference about winning is this. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=727.4s)]
*  The political process has gotten to the point of this visceral hatred that I've [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=729.16s)]
*  got to create you as an enemy and hate you in order to compete against you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=732.6s)]
*  I've never done business that way. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=736.12s)]
*  I've played ball all my life. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=738.04s)]
*  I've done this. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=739.48s)]
*  I've competed in business. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=740.1999999999999s)]
*  I want to beat you, but I don't want to defeat you. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=741.64s)]
*  I want to come back because as a good competitor, you'll make me better. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=743.64s)]
*  And I have learned from every race I've ever been in, every one of my opponents [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=747.4s)]
*  gave me value and I used some of their ideas. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=751.48s)]
*  I've always cherished that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=754.52s)]
*  And now it's almost I've got to just despise you because I've got to destroy you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=756.76s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=762.12s)]
*  And I don't think that's who America is. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=762.8399999999999s)]
*  I said we have enough enemies around the world. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=764.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't need to create any more here. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=766.36s)]
*  And that's what the system is. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=768.28s)]
*  They've weaponized it and Donald Trump has been able to normalize it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=769.56s)]
*  So I've said this. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=773.4s)]
*  Donald Trump shook it up. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=774.52s)]
*  He'll break it this time he gets back in. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  And Joe Biden needs to wake up. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=778.52s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=779.88s)]
*  He's gone clear to the social end of it and people aren't going to accept that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=780.28s)]
*  So it's a hell of a conundrum we're in. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=784.04s)]
*  Would you have preferred President Biden not to run for reelection? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  I've never, ever, ever given a person advice on where they should run or not run. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=790.52s)]
*  They got to make that decision. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  The bottom line is, if you're going to run, how are you going to win? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=796.76s)]
*  And I believe that Joe Biden, if it comes down to those two, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=801.0s)]
*  if he moved back to the center, which what people thought they were getting, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=805.4s)]
*  I think he would be in good shape. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=809.3199999999999s)]
*  If he stays over to the left and all these regulations they have, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=810.5999999999999s)]
*  they've overregulated us to the point we almost [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=813.8s)]
*  can't produce it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=815.64s)]
*  There's no there's no certainty in anything that we're doing right now because it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=816.28s)]
*  this doesn't make a lot of sense, guys. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=821.3199999999999s)]
*  But still, yet, you know, I think that most people in America [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=823.24s)]
*  maybe feel like I and political arena in my own personal life, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=827.4s)]
*  I feel that I'm very fiscally responsible and socially compassionate. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=830.68s)]
*  I don't care whether you're Democrat, Republican or independent. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=834.6s)]
*  I bet you there's a majority people feel the same. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=836.68s)]
*  Well, you're a national co-chair of the No Labels organization. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=839.96s)]
*  No, I'm not a co-chair. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=844.12s)]
*  Myself and John Huntsman started out as the first co-chairs in 2010, 2011. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  So I've been with them. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=849.88s)]
*  The reason I was attracted to No Labels and I still am attracted, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=850.6800000000001s)]
*  they're the only group in D.C. that gives you a venue to where you can sit down and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=854.2s)]
*  meet people on the other side and have an adult conversation without this going on [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=860.36s)]
*  because you're in the spotlight. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=865.8s)]
*  I have to make you know, how do we agree? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=866.76s)]
*  So we've been able to work. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=868.44s)]
*  They've spun off problem solvers and some things. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=869.48s)]
*  But no, I'm not I'm not a co-chair. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=871.96s)]
*  I'm very proud of what they've been doing, what they're trying to do to give options. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=874.2s)]
*  Well, we in our poll that was published over the weekend, we tested you by name as a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=878.76s)]
*  No Labels candidate. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=883.88s)]
*  And I hate to break it to you. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  You've got 3% of the vote. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=886.84s)]
*  Yeah, probably a bad poll. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=888.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's my question is based on that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=892.5200000000001s)]
*  How can you claim that there is that the American people are crying out for this [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=894.2s)]
*  centrist alternative? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=898.0400000000001s)]
*  I haven't even I haven't said a word. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=899.08s)]
*  I haven't been on the road. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=901.0s)]
*  Haven't done anything. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=901.72s)]
*  So they just have to meet Joe Manchin. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=903.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm just saying whether it's me or somebody, but I can tell you where do [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=904.52s)]
*  you you've done a poll where it says 60 to 70% don't want Donald Trump or Joe Biden? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=908.1999999999999s)]
*  I think you did that poll too. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=912.52s)]
*  How'd that work? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=914.68s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=916.84s)]
*  They don't want them, but they don't know what they want. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=918.36s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=920.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=920.92s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=921.4s)]
*  The system should be more competitive. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=922.6s)]
*  You better figure out what the root problem is. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=924.04s)]
*  And the root problem right now is why we're so divided because you have maybe out of 435 [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=926.12s)]
*  congressional districts, 380 to maybe 390 are already predetermined. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=932.0400000000001s)]
*  Donald Duck can be an art and an art district. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=937.0s)]
*  He's going to win. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=939.08s)]
*  Mickey Mouse could be a D and a D state and D district and they're going to win. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=940.2s)]
*  So basically, there's not much of a contest. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=945.6400000000001s)]
*  We're just separating it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=949.48s)]
*  If you can't change how we draw our district lines, maybe better change how you do your [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=950.7600000000001s)]
*  primaries to where majority rules majority wins. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=955.8800000000001s)]
*  That's all. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=958.44s)]
*  If you don't get 51%, you keep running until you get 51%. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=958.92s)]
*  Should a person get 35% basically, speaking for the other 65%? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=962.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=968.68s)]
*  That's just me. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=970.52s)]
*  But that might be the easiest way to change, to get more diversity. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=971.24s)]
*  And they can't predetermine it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  And then the duopoly of the two-party system can't say they own you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=976.52s)]
*  Well, as someone who's so critical of the two-party system and of your own- [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=980.36s)]
*  I'm not critical of it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=984.36s)]
*  Just think about it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=985.3199999999999s)]
*  It's the biggest business in town. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=986.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=987.56s)]
*  The election in 2008 was a $6 billion race. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=987.72s)]
*  We never heard of those kind of numbers. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=991.96s)]
*  2020, 16 billion. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=994.52s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=996.84s)]
*  No one's paying attention to the business model. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=997.72s)]
*  The business model, it's unbelievable. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=999.96s)]
*  It's very profitable. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1001.48s)]
*  They wouldn't know. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1003.0s)]
*  You won't change your business model if you keep growing and it's profitable. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  You just don't do it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1007.08s)]
*  Business people don't do that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1007.72s)]
*  So I don't expect them to change. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1009.1600000000001s)]
*  If you think you're going to get change in Washington, it'll never happen. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  Why have you stayed a Democrat all these years? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1013.72s)]
*  Why not do what your colleague Kirsten Sinema has done and be an independent and try to- [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1015.56s)]
*  If I think that identity changes who I am, now all of a sudden if I put an I, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1020.28s)]
*  do you think I'm going to vote any different? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1025.48s)]
*  If I put an R by my name, do you think I'm going to vote any different? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  The Republicans would certainly love to have you. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1030.6799999999998s)]
*  You've turned down a lot of entreaties from them over the years, haven't you? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1032.44s)]
*  I've been able to stop a lot of bad stuff. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  And I've been able to, I think, be a deciding vote in helping a lot of good things, I hope. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1039.96s)]
*  And I've made mistakes. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1045.0s)]
*  So I've done all three. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1046.52s)]
*  I've never made a mistake intentionally and I never voted that I thought would help [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1047.96s)]
*  my political position back home. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1053.4s)]
*  If I did, why would I basically kill BBB and my poll numbers went to 67 percent [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1055.56s)]
*  in a state that's an R40, a Republican state? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1062.36s)]
*  If that was the case, I said, okay, then just don't do a thing. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1066.52s)]
*  I'm in good shape right now. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1069.4s)]
*  Just vote no on everything from this day forward. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1070.52s)]
*  As soon as I saw the Ukraine war, I knew we were in big trouble. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1073.08s)]
*  Come back and did the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1076.84s)]
*  My poll numbers, I lost 35 points in one day. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1079.9599999999998s)]
*  So I'm not that stupid. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1083.32s)]
*  I understand what's happening. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1084.9199999999998s)]
*  But what's my purpose of being here? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1086.4399999999998s)]
*  So if I thought I could help, I did it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1088.9199999999998s)]
*  And if I made a mistake, I can fix it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1090.76s)]
*  But I'm just trying to hold the administration's feet to the fire, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1092.36s)]
*  implement the bill that we passed, not the one that you wanted, the one we passed. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1096.28s)]
*  You couldn't pass the one you wanted. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1100.4399999999998s)]
*  We gave you something we think is a much more balanced bill. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1102.6s)]
*  Well, I hope you're all thinking about questions you might want to ask the senator. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1106.1999999999998s)]
*  We will take some questions from the audience for questions. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  You're in trouble in a couple of minutes. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1111.9599999999998s)]
*  But but we've had a lot of talk on this stage about the unhappiness of the American electorate. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1114.28s)]
*  People are very, very unhappy out there. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1119.0s)]
*  I'm sure you experienced this. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1122.28s)]
*  You've talked to your constituents and yet, you know, this inflation is cooling. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  Unemployment is low. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1128.04s)]
*  A lot of economic indicators seem positive. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1129.48s)]
*  Why are people so unhappy? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1131.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1133.0s)]
*  I think it's basically getting bombarded how they get their news and what news they get. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1133.48s)]
*  I've always said you're entitled to your own opinion. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1136.84s)]
*  You're just not entitled to create your own facts to support your opinion. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1139.08s)]
*  Now you can have the most craziest opinion in the world and you're upset. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1143.08s)]
*  But I guarantee you in social media, cable news, whatever it may be, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1146.2s)]
*  you can find somebody who'll support your crazy opinion with some crazy facts. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1150.6000000000001s)]
*  So everybody thinks they're right. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1155.0s)]
*  It's just a horrible situation we're in. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1156.68s)]
*  And, you know, it's just I don't know. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1159.08s)]
*  When I spoke to the gridiron club, I begged them. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1161.96s)]
*  I said, listen, on a serious note, you're responsible. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1163.72s)]
*  Wall Street Journal is responsible for putting good, solid reporting out. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1166.76s)]
*  You shouldn't be taking sides. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1170.12s)]
*  Put the facts out there. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1171.72s)]
*  I'll figure what side I want to be on. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1172.6s)]
*  And it's hard. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1174.6s)]
*  So I got to tell people I'm big on NPR and PBS. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1175.24s)]
*  I'm big on BBC. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1179.0s)]
*  As far as world news, I try to get a little bit of the skinny. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1180.6799999999998s)]
*  I can get more of a non-partial commentator more so. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1183.32s)]
*  I mean, that's awful to say. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  I read four or five. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1189.72s)]
*  I read the Wall Street Journal religiously every morning, every morning. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1191.0s)]
*  I read it twice. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1194.9199999999998s)]
*  I read Saturday twice on Sunday. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1196.6799999999998s)]
*  That's an excellent idea. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1199.3999999999999s)]
*  Everyone should do it. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1200.76s)]
*  But that's interesting. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1201.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, are you proposing a more robust public funding model for media, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1202.6799999999998s)]
*  given that we all know the business model for media is broken? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1206.76s)]
*  Remember, what was our model before truth and lending, a truth and sp- [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  how you always- there was a bill before that you couldn't just [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1212.36s)]
*  say anything you wanted to in the news. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1215.0s)]
*  You had to give equal time. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1216.84s)]
*  So if you said something outrageous to someone, you had to give equal time. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  So the cable news basically sprung up after that was taken out of the equation. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1220.6000000000001s)]
*  So things of that sort. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1225.96s)]
*  Anybody got a question for the senator? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1227.8s)]
*  If not, I'm happy to continue to grill him. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1229.64s)]
*  But just raise your hand. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1232.04s)]
*  Give me the high sign if you want to ask him. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1233.3200000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1236.2s)]
*  Well, all right. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1236.52s)]
*  Over here. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1237.88s)]
*  There's a microphone coming your way if you give it just a second. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1239.64s)]
*  I've always admired your common sense. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1246.52s)]
*  I'm a Canadian. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1248.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm married to an American. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1249.56s)]
*  My kids all live down here. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1250.6799999999998s)]
*  Smart, smart guy. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1252.36s)]
*  Smart guy. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1253.24s)]
*  I run a Canadian bank, CIBC. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1254.28s)]
*  We've met before. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1256.2s)]
*  I wanted to get your view on North American economic resilience and strength, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1257.6399999999999s)]
*  given that our continent here is probably best positioned [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1264.28s)]
*  to power the global economy and to shape the global economy together. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1268.84s)]
*  Whether you're running or not running, what would be your areas of focus [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1273.8s)]
*  in terms of ensuring we have economic strength in this part of the world? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1277.72s)]
*  We have to work so hard on Mexico. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1281.24s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1282.92s)]
*  I'm really, really concerned about Mexico. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1284.04s)]
*  You have a cache of rarest minerals up and there's going to be an awful lot of investment, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1288.2s)]
*  a lot of the US and Canadian, I think more cohesion there than ever before. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1293.0s)]
*  But Mexico's given us a hard time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1298.84s)]
*  Mexico's allowing 100,000 Americans to be deliberately targeted and be poisoned every year. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1300.6000000000001s)]
*  That's got to stop and they can stop it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1307.24s)]
*  China's got to be held accountable for what they're doing in Mexico. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1310.28s)]
*  Mexico's got to be held accountable for basically allowing a lot of products [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1313.0s)]
*  that we try to sanction that has unfair competition in North America, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1317.48s)]
*  especially in the US and Canada, coming through their borders. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1321.0s)]
*  So we've got to get them back in. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1324.28s)]
*  And if they're not, don't keep it in USMC. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1326.04s)]
*  I'd threaten USMC with them. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1328.36s)]
*  There's no need. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1329.8s)]
*  We don't need a partner like you, even though you're on my border. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1330.44s)]
*  If you're going to get with it or we're going to basically have one hell of a conversation, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1333.24s)]
*  wipe out the cartels, we'll help you. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1336.52s)]
*  Basically sanction that living crap out of China if they continue to let the precursors come in. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1339.72s)]
*  Not only do they manufacture the precursors for fentanyl, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1345.4s)]
*  they give you the presses to make it into the cartels. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1349.32s)]
*  That's the craziness we're dealing with. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1352.6s)]
*  And Mexico's got to make a decision. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1354.6s)]
*  They want to be part of the world order and part of USMC. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1356.28s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1361.16s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1361.8s)]
*  We have all the ingredients. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1362.68s)]
*  We've defied everything right now. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1364.52s)]
*  Both of us, us and Canada especially. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1366.12s)]
*  And Mexico is doing well because of us. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1368.28s)]
*  So just getting our of our act together. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1370.84s)]
*  And that's going to be us and Canada making sure that Mexico understands. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1373.7199999999998s)]
*  We want them and need them as our tremendous partner making up North America. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1377.56s)]
*  But by God, you're going to act like a responsible partner. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1381.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1385.32s)]
*  Did we have another question over here? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1386.28s)]
*  I thought it's on their hand. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1387.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1388.6s)]
*  Neil Salmon, I'm a Brit, but looking on with interest in America, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1392.84s)]
*  you talked about changing the primary system and the districting system, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1396.28s)]
*  which a few of us have discussed. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1399.8799999999999s)]
*  Without that, it seems impossible for any change in the political dynamic. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1401.9599999999998s)]
*  So is there a path to any consensus? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1405.48s)]
*  The easiest one to change is the primary system. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1409.0s)]
*  States are doing it now. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1411.8799999999999s)]
*  Some states are doing it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  They're just sick and tired of basically having a control. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1414.6s)]
*  Let me just give you the system. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1417.08s)]
*  Am I talking about the duopoly in the politics and business of politics? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1418.52s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1421.8s)]
*  A descendant of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, our beloved president, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1423.08s)]
*  Robert Kennedy Jr., that can't even compete and get involved in the Democratic primary. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1428.28s)]
*  As crazy as I may think he is on certain things, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1434.36s)]
*  you would think the name Kennedy being a direct higher [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1437.32s)]
*  answer, you know, lineage to the president, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1441.6399999999999s)]
*  Kennedy would at least have an ability to compete, don't you think? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1444.36s)]
*  Now, if the system is that close, it tells you everything. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  Just think about it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1450.84s)]
*  So I think the primary I think changing for me, I can tell you exactly if I was [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1453.4799999999998s)]
*  king for a day, I won't say dictator for a day, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1459.8799999999999s)]
*  king for a day. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1462.6799999999998s)]
*  If I was king for a day, what I would do, I would put in a computer system [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1463.9599999999998s)]
*  and I would basically, you know, program the computer to give me a diversity [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1468.76s)]
*  in every 435 districts. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKwhuG2Wylw&t=1473.24s)]
