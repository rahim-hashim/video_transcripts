**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas)
*  Let's just dive right in on the war on youth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=0.0s)]
*  Like, your contention is that society is treating young people very badly. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=3.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=10.16s)]
*  My kids love this idea. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=10.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=12.08s)]
*  Like, expound. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=13.08s)]
*  So first off, most of my stats are about America. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I apologize, but I would argue most of these trends are pretty similar in Europe and in the UK. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=19.0s)]
*  In the US, for the first time in our 275-year history, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=24.04s)]
*  a 30-year-old man or woman isn't doing as well as his or her parents economically. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=28.0s)]
*  And that may not sound like a big deal, but I think that's essentially the social compact breaking. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=32.84s)]
*  And it creates rage and shame. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what do you want? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=39.96s)]
*  You want to play by the rules, you want to work hard, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  and then the ultimate outcome is your kids are going to do as well or better than you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=42.52s)]
*  And when that doesn't happen, it creates just tremendous dissatisfaction with everything. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=46.92s)]
*  The average 70-year-old is 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=54.64s)]
*  The average person under the age of 40 is 24% less wealthy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=59.36s)]
*  And if you think, I believe that almost every major economic policy in the US is nothing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=63.44s)]
*  but a thinly veiled transfer of wealth from young to old, from the entrance to the incumbents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=67.4s)]
*  Two biggest tax deductions, capital gains and mortgage interest. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=72.92s)]
*  Who owns stocks and homes? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=76.84s)]
*  People my age. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=79.8s)]
*  Who makes their money from current income and rents? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  Young people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=85.72s)]
*  Social security, which you're not supposed to talk about as this third rail. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=86.64s)]
*  I see it as just a $1.4 trillion transfer of wealth from young people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  to the wealthiest generation in the history of the planet. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=95.04s)]
*  I'm not suggesting social security is a bad idea, but let's call it senior security. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=97.44s)]
*  Because I think that type of transfer of wealth should be based on need, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=101.84s)]
*  on whether or not you have a catheter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=106.12s)]
*  So I think it's outrageous what is going on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=108.84s)]
*  And what do you know? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  We have, oh, and then the ultimate intergenerational wealth transfer [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=113.36s)]
*  in the history of the planet was, I have an idea. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  Under the auspices of a virus, let's, you know, a million people would be bad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=119.92s)]
*  Dying would be bad. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=124.76s)]
*  But what would be tragic is that boomers got less wealthy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  So let's come in and flood the market with $5 to $7 trillion in stimulus. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=128.76s)]
*  60 to 80% of it, depending on which survey you look at, was not spent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=133.84s)]
*  It was saved. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't spent on food or medication. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=138.44s)]
*  It was saved. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  People didn't need it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  So what happened to that money? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=143.55999999999997s)]
*  It went into the market. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=144.72s)]
*  And you saw real estate prices go from an average of 290,000 to 410 in the US. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  And then when you couple that with interest rates, the average mortgage has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  gone from 1,100 to 2,200, meaning that whereas two-thirds of Americans could [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  have formed a home, now it's one-third. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=157.2s)]
*  So if you owned a home, champagne and cocaine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  Look at what's happened to the stock market. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  Look what's happened to the stock market. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=164.04s)]
*  It's screamed, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=165.64s)]
*  So it's great if you own stocks. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=167.4s)]
*  So the entrants have essentially been screwed to keep the incumbents rich. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=169.4s)]
*  And who's going to have to pay for the stimulus that benefits me? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=174.08s)]
*  The entrants. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  It's debt. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=178.28s)]
*  It's all been debt-fueled. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  And then my industry is speedballing it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=180.8s)]
*  Higher education, we and my colleagues, and I'll pause for the work salad. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=185.0s)]
*  I'll wrap up here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  Every morning, me and my colleagues in higher education, and to a certain extent, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=189.56s)]
*  the incumbents, who in my opinion have got incredible regulatory capture, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=192.84s)]
*  we wake up and we look in the mirror and we ask ourselves one question every day. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=197.44s)]
*  How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  And we've managed to do this with this amazing strategy in higher education, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  which is still the primary upper lubricant for talented kids on rampant in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  the middle class, wealthy homes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=213.72000000000003s)]
*  We've adopted an LVMH strategy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's artificially constrain supply. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  Artificially constrain supply. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=221.28s)]
*  Let me get this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=222.84s)]
*  The endowment of Harvard is up 4,000% in the last 40 years, and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=224.6s)]
*  they've increased the freshman seats by 4%. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=228.72s)]
*  They could admit 15,000 people every year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Instead, they admit 1,500, what a good Starbucks does. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=234.76s)]
*  So we can all feel really just awesome about how amazing we are. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=238.16s)]
*  And the people who already have a degree, the boomers, the incumbents, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=241.56s)]
*  the value of their degree goes up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=246.32s)]
*  And then once- [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=248.44s)]
*  But do you think it would be better to have twice as many Harvard graduates? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=249.32s)]
*  Ten times as many. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=252.24s)]
*  Ten times as many. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=254.2s)]
*  They could have 15,000 kids and have absolutely no decrease in the quality of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=255.84s)]
*  their freshman class. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=261.2s)]
*  And all this bull**** anger over DEI is an incredible misdirect and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=262.36s)]
*  unnecessary because it's not about who gets in, it's about how many. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=267.64s)]
*  You know where there's no arguments over DEI? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=271.56s)]
*  The great community colleges. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=273.44s)]
*  Because it's just, do you want to come in? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=275.16s)]
*  Do you want to pursue a better life? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  Then come here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=279.6s)]
*  When I applied to UCLA, the admissions rate was 76%. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=280.8s)]
*  I didn't mean to sound angry at you, I'm just angry. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=283.76s)]
*  When I applied to UCLA, the admissions rate was 76%. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=287.52s)]
*  I was installing shelving in the Inland Empire in Los Angeles. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=291.04s)]
*  The highlight of my day is I used to get ridiculously f****** high with my coworkers [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  and then take to the highways of Southern California. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=299.24s)]
*  And I've been rejected at a college that had a 76% admissions rate. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=302.6s)]
*  My mom said, why don't you apply again? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  And I remember this moment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=308.68s)]
*  The admissions director called me and said, you're not qualified, but [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  you're a native son of California, we're letting you in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=313.88000000000005s)]
*  And then, out of UCLA, I got a 2.27 GPA. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=316.68s)]
*  For those of you that don't know, that's not very good. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=319.68s)]
*  And what did the finest public school in the world do? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=322.72s)]
*  Berkeley? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  It let me into graduate school. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  And that's the whole point of higher ed, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  is most of us aren't freakishly remarkable at 18. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  The whole point is to give unremarkable people a chance at being remarkable. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=333.88s)]
*  And this is a flex, but it's relevant here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  Last year, I paid $14 million in f****** federal income tax. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  And guess what? It's worked out for all of us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=343.28s)]
*  We're not here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=345.88s)]
*  Me and my colleagues aren't here to identify a super class of rich kids and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=347.28s)]
*  freakishly remarkable and turn them into billionaires. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  We're here to give everyone a shot at being a millionaire at some point. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=354.44s)]
*  We have totally lost the script. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  And it's been adopted by America. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  Once we have a house in America, we get very concerned with traffic. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  And we start showing up at the local review board, and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=364.64s)]
*  we make sure no housing gets built. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=366.68s)]
*  There's a million and a half fewer houses in household formation. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  The result is the incumbents that already own houses [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=371.88s)]
*  have seen the value of their real estate skyrocket. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=374.48s)]
*  So where does this all end up with youth in America? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=377.32s)]
*  More obese, more anxious, more depressed, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=380.68s)]

*  The highest suicide rates, the highest self-harm rates. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=387.84s)]
*  I mean, what is the point of any of this if our kids are depressed? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  Literally, what's the point? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  We talk about GDP, we talk about growth, we talk about [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=401.64s)]
*  who gives a f*** if our kids aren't doing well? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=404.55999999999995s)]
*  We have literally lost the script. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=407.08s)]
*  And we keep voting ourselves seniors who vote and have represented, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=409.88s)]
*  have elected a group of people that is a cross between [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  the golden girls and the walking dead. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=417.0s)]
*  Keep voting themselves more money. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  Voting themselves more money. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=423.6s)]
*  In the US, we spend the lowest per capita on children of any nation in the west. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=425.0s)]
*  And what do you know, kids aren't doing well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=430.12s)]
*  Sorry, back to you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=433.64s)]
*  So what's your advice to, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=434.16s)]
*  I mean this message resonates incredibly well online. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=439.12s)]
*  You've given lectures, Ted Talks, whatever, and everyone I know between [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=443.12s)]
*  the ages of 25 and 45 know who you are, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=446.68s)]
*  What's your advice to them? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=452.24s)]
*  They're not gonna change the world and fix all these things. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=453.92s)]
*  We're not gonna, I mean overnight. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=455.96s)]
*  So if you're coming up right now, how do you navigate this? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=457.56s)]
*  Well, it sounds very tripe. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=462.36s)]
*  The first thing is vote. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=463.6s)]
*  But look, we have the power. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=465.68s)]
*  We're the ones that have money. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=468.0s)]
*  And money has basically become more important than votes in DC. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  So the question is, and we all see this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=474.92s)]
*  We all see kids, friends of our kids. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=477.24s)]
*  We see, I think, something going on, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=480.32s)]
*  And so it strikes me that past generations have always made these forward leaning [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  investments and we're no longer doing that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=488.48s)]
*  And I don't know if it's an intergenerational selfishness. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=496.64s)]
*  But if we don't adopt and elect people who have, I mean, there's a bunch of things. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=499.0s)]
*  We need rank choice voting. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=504.4s)]
*  We need to make it such that an organization that has an approval rate of 8% doesn't have [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=505.96s)]
*  a 94% re-election. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=509.68s)]
*  We need to elect more moderates instead of the crazies on the left and the crazy on the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=511.96s)]
*  rights with rank choice and final five voting. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=515.36s)]
*  We need a younger elected populace of leaders that is closer to the average age of Americans, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=518.28s)]
*  38 versus the average age, now 62. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=524.96s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi had her first child. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=527.56s)]
*  Mark Fidel Castro had just declared martial law and two thirds of households in the United [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=530.76s)]
*  States did not have color televisions. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=534.92s)]
*  But she's supposed to understand the challenges a 17 year old girl who's 5'9", 95 pounds, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  getting extreme dieting tips from Metta sent to her on her phone. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  She's supposed to understand that, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=545.7199999999999s)]
*  Joseph Biden at 81 is supposed to understand the threats of TikTok. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  And quite frankly, he does. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=553.28s)]
*  Someone's advising him. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=554.8s)]
*  But do these people really understand the challenges facing a 25 year old single mother [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=556.5200000000001s)]
*  in the technology? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  Do they understand a 23 year old male that has very little opportunities, whose prefrontal [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  cortex is not that developed, who has fewer and fewer on ramps to the middle class, and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  is getting notified 210 times a day he should bet on this week's football match? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  Do they really understand what's facing young people? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=574.48s)]
*  So we have the wrong elected representatives that are not representative of America. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=577.86s)]
*  We have immense regulatory capture by the incumbents, big companies, and we are not [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=582.52s)]
*  investing in youth. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=587.16s)]
*  And we have and then me and my colleagues are making it worse with this bulls**t rejectionist [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=588.6s)]
*  LVMH strategy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=593.88s)]
*  I mean, young people vote. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=595.68s)]
*  But unless we do something, unless we decide we have an obligation to pay it forward a [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=598.9399999999999s)]
*  little bit, I don't think any of this changes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=603.92s)]
*  Aren't more isn't a greater percentage of the young population going to college? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=606.72s)]
*  They're not going to Harvard, obviously, but they are going to college. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=610.48s)]
*  More kids are educated. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=612.88s)]
*  In fact, some people think the kids are overeducated, that they're loaded up on student debt, they [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=613.88s)]
*  get skills that they can't use in the workplace where they, you know, they can't pay off the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=618.52s)]
*  debt. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=622.24s)]
*  And, you know, it's, they would have been better off being in the workforce with some [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=623.24s)]
*  sort of specific skill, vocational training, something like that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=628.28s)]
*  So I find it hard to see how doubling the size of the class at Harvard, Yale, everywhere [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=631.34s)]
*  is going to solve the problem in a country of 325 million people. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=636.88s)]
*  There are three things. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=640.04s)]
*  So go to solutions. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=641.7199999999999s)]
*  If we took some of that 750 billion that Biden earmarked for student loan bailout, it just [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=643.0s)]
*  makes no sense to bail out one third of the people who've had the opportunity to go to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=647.28s)]
*  college on the backs of two thirds that didn't. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=650.88s)]
*  I just think that policy was flawed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=652.88s)]
*  If you're going to tax people a half a trillion or three quarters of a trillion dollars, it [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=655.04s)]
*  has to be a forward leaning investment that benefits everybody. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=658.8399999999999s)]
*  And all that was going to do was shrink the tumor but not cause cure the underlying cancer, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  we have various prices faster than inflation, faster than any sector with the exception [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=667.48s)]
*  of healthcare. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=671.88s)]
*  If you'd taken 500 billion of that and taken our 500 greatest public universities and give [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=672.88s)]
*  them each on a size adjusted basis, a billion dollars for three things. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=676.32s)]
*  First, increase the freshman class by 6% a year. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=681.12s)]
*  I do think these amazing public universities are better. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=686.52s)]
*  I think they prepare kids, the faculty is better, the experience is better. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=689.2s)]
*  And we have the capacity to massively increase their acceptance rates. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=692.56s)]
*  Because what ends up happening is these kids get arbitraged down to a second tier school [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=698.76s)]
*  that because of this corrupt cartel pricing we all engage in, we all magically raise our [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=702.56s)]
*  tuition the exact same amount each year. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=707.4s)]
*  What a coincidence. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  So what happens is a kid trying to get to these aspirational LVMH like colleges gets [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=710.76s)]
*  arb down to a second tier college and ends up paying a Mercedes price for a Hyundai [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=714.3599999999999s)]
*  product. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=718.92s)]
*  And then the real tragedy, there's more kids in school, but the real tragedy is the number [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=720.06s)]
*  of kids under the following circumstances gone up 12 fold. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=724.7399999999999s)]
*  And that is they go to college because their parents shame them for not going to college. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=727.9799999999999s)]
*  They're not cut out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=732.26s)]
*  They're there two or three years or they're long enough to rack up 100,000 in debt. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=733.26s)]
*  And then they leave school because it's just not for them, they're depressed, but they [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=737.78s)]
*  get to hold on to their debt. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=741.26s)]
*  You want to talk about screwing young people? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=743.14s)]
*  One of the only forms of debt in the United States that is not dischargeable under bankruptcy [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=745.5s)]
*  is the exact debt that should be the most dischargeable. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=750.22s)]
*  And that's the debt on young people, student loan debt. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=752.22s)]
*  It haunts you the rest of your life. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=754.46s)]
*  And so there's this class, this generation of kids who pay my salary, right? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=756.22s)]
*  Actually, I've returned all of my compensation last 20 years, but pay my colleague's salary [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=760.94s)]
*  and end up with massive debt. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=765.54s)]
*  And then third thing they should do, one, grow freshman class 6%, cut costs 2% a year [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=767.58s)]
*  using technology and scale. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=772.7s)]
*  We could do that with no problem. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=774.06s)]
*  And then what do you get in 10 years? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=776.18s)]
*  You have double the freshman seats at our elite publics, and then you have inflation [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=778.3399999999999s)]
*  justice cut the cost in half. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=782.54s)]
*  This isn't a radical idea. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=784.14s)]
*  This is called college in the 80s and 90s. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=785.3s)]
*  And then the third part is 20% of all certifications and degrees should be vocational. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=787.2199999999999s)]
*  One, how come we haven't evolved? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=792.5s)]
*  Think about how much products have evolved everywhere. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=794.38s)]
*  We still jam everyone through this four-year liberal arts construct. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=796.78s)]
*  Why wouldn't we have one or two year degrees in specialty nursing, in construction for [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=800.5799999999999s)]
*  nuclear power plants, plumbing, right? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=804.8199999999999s)]
*  Installation of soapstone counters. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=808.86s)]
*  I'm renovating a home. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=810.9s)]
*  Anyone who's renovating a home knows that if you have these types of skills, and there's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=814.14s)]
*  a lot of people, especially young men, who are handier. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=817.9s)]
*  I know that sounds sexist, but they are handier. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=821.06s)]
*  That's one of the few things we have, one of the few things we still have. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=823.78s)]
*  And they can make between $90,000 and $130,000 within two years. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=827.4s)]
*  11% of LinkedIn profiles in the UK say apprentice, 12% in Germany say apprentice, in the US it's [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=830.6s)]
*  3%, because we've decided if you don't go to MIT and end up at Google, you have failed [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=836.36s)]
*  and your parents have failed and you should all feel shame. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's an absence of tradespeople. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=843.8s)]
*  Five people are going to leave the trades the next 10 years in the US, and only two are [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=846.4s)]
*  going to enter. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=849.16s)]
*  The place we train these kids is our great public universities. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=850.92s)]
*  They have the infrastructure, they have the skills, they have the contacts. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=854.24s)]
*  So anyways, lower costs, increase freshmen seats, and to your point, massively increase [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=858.2s)]
*  the amount of vocational certification. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=863.32s)]
*  This sounds like a political movement, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=866.08s)]
*  The youth are going to, they're getting screwed, they're going to rise up. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=868.0s)]
*  Draw a line between this dissatisfaction and what we're seeing on college campuses right [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=871.84s)]
*  now, where students are encamped against the war in Gaza, demanding divestment, doing [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=876.36s)]
*  things that are making their parents crazy, and is there a connection there? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=884.22s)]
*  I think it's an incendiary port on everything that turns any cut into an opportunistic infection. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=891.5s)]
*  It makes everyone old, meaning every time, it makes all situations potentially, you could [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  get pneumonia and die. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=904.76s)]
*  Everything becomes worse, because young people are just naturally enraged. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=906.38s)]
*  One of the problems I think that young people are having with this movement on campus, whether [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=910.74s)]
*  they agree with it or not, is how many spokespeople have really emerged. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=914.14s)]
*  The premier spokesperson that's gone viral for the protests on campus was demanding that [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=918.1s)]
*  the revolution be catered. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=922.42s)]
*  If you think about most effective movements, it's been, they have matured a really powerful [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=924.52s)]
*  spokesperson who can articulate a strong message. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=930.04s)]
*  The message I'm getting mostly from students on campus is, you know what, we're just pissed [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=932.86s)]
*  off. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=937.9399999999999s)]
*  We're just pissed off. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=939.14s)]
*  Now there's also a bit of a misnomer there. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=940.8199999999999s)]
*  It's a bit misleading, because if you look at Columbia, which is kind of the flashpoint, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=943.64s)]
*  it's less than 1% of the students. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=946.96s)]
*  They just elected an Israeli girl as their president. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=948.66s)]
*  I was just on NYU's campus. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=951.86s)]
*  The majority, 99 plus percent of the kids are just going to class and doing their thing. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=953.76s)]
*  They claim somewhere between 40 and 60% of the protesters on campus aren't even students. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=958.4s)]
*  Anyways, I think it takes everything, every movement that has justification. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=962.8s)]
*  It's great that young people challenge the status quo. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=970.36s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=975.1s)]
*  They weaponize new mediums. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=976.1s)]
*  But I think it turns every minor problem or anything we could have a civil discourse around [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=977.48s)]
*  just into rage. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=982.92s)]
*  If people are angry, it's like being in a relationship. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=984.22s)]
*  Most of the times when your spouse or your partner gets really angry and blows up at [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=988.48s)]
*  you, it's not about the situation at hand. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=992.72s)]
*  It's about the atmosphere and they're upset about something more broadly. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=995.52s)]
*  So is this a manifestation of... [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=999.42s)]
*  Specifically campus right now? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1002.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1004.5s)]
*  I think it's three things. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1005.5s)]
*  One, me and my colleagues again have created this orthodoxy of oppressed and oppressor. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1006.5s)]
*  Oppressors over there, oppressed over here. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1011.62s)]
*  You're one or the other. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1013.18s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think that young people conflate the civil rights movement with what's [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1015.8199999999999s)]
*  happening to the residents of Gaza. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1022.02s)]
*  And the easiest way to identify an oppressor is how rich and how white they are and fairly [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1024.94s)]
*  or unfairly I think Jews in Israel are seen as ground zero for the ultimate rich and whiteness. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1029.22s)]
*  I think the statistics are overwhelming that this makes no sense. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1035.5s)]
*  I've said this very publicly. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1040.7s)]
*  2,200 service people die at Pearl Harbor. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1042.54s)]
*  We go on to kill 3.5 million Japanese, including 100,000 in one night. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1045.82s)]
*  2,800 Americans die in 9-11. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1050.02s)]
*  We go on to kill 400,000 people in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1051.98s)]
*  I think at least the numbers and the responses and the response on campus don't foot to actual [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1056.3s)]
*  history in terms of what people seem to be outraged about. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1060.18s)]
*  I generally think that bottom line is Jews aren't allowed to win a war. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1064.02s)]
*  We're just not allowed to win a war, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1068.58s)]
*  Everyone else who's attacked is allowed to come back and win a war except for Israel [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1071.74s)]
*  and Jews. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1075.78s)]
*  So I believe that 2, they're also, quite frankly, Israel has not draped itself in glory. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1077.12s)]
*  Netanyahu, in my opinion, is diabolical, has cut a deal with the devil with the far-right [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1082.7s)]
*  extremist sect of his country, has put bigots in the Knesset, and the over-settlements and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1088.26s)]
*  treatment of people in Gaza has been terrible. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1093.1000000000001s)]
*  We've gone, when I say we, I have family in Israel, we've gone from being the David to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1096.14s)]
*  the Goliath, so the atmospherics are terrible. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1100.02s)]
*  And you also have, in my opinion, a situation where, and I know this sounds paranoid, doesn't [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1103.38s)]
*  mean I'm wrong. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1110.02s)]
*  If I were the CCP and I controlled the most effective propaganda tool in history, where [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1112.3s)]
*  the majority of people under the age of 25 would prefer to have TikTok than all other [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1119.94s)]
*  media combined, I would put my thumb on the scale of things that divide America. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  We can't beat you kinetically, we can't beat you economically, so I got it, we got the [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1130.06s)]
*  perfect strategy. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1133.06s)]
*  We're going to get you to hate each other. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1134.06s)]
*  That's what we would do. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1135.34s)]
*  We have a division that does this. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1136.46s)]
*  It's called PsyOps and the Army. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1137.58s)]
*  It's exactly what we would do. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1139.02s)]
*  And so now on TikTok, there are 52 pro-Hamas videos serve for every one pro-Israel video. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1140.62s)]
*  And actually more young people under the age of 25 support Israel than don't. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1146.1399999999999s)]
*  So with something going on, you're like, well Scott, you're being paranoid. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1150.8s)]
*  These kids know how to use this medium, they're just using it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1153.34s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1156.22s)]
*  But if you go on the control group, if you go on Instagram Reels, there's 600 times as [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1157.22s)]
*  many videos being served on Uighur genocide or Free Tibet. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1162.3s)]
*  Is that just a coincidence? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1167.3s)]
*  If you want to understand the ratios of video being served on CCP when they're dramatically [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1168.96s)]
*  out of line from public opinion, just go, what would the CCP want? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1172.96s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1176.8s)]
*  We're almost out of time, so I just want to give a chance for questions in the audience [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1177.8s)]
*  right here, first row. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  Hi, Scott. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  Hi, how are you? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  Good, good. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  Sid Wilson, I'm president and CEO of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility in [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  Washington, D.C., here in London. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1191.68s)]
*  Great, good to see you. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1193.16s)]
*  My question is... [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1194.16s)]
*  You're here a lot, the head of the Hispanic in London. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  You're here. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1198.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, no, no, we're basically, I'm just saying that we're in D.C., but I'm actually here [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1199.3600000000001s)]
*  in London, even though the issues that I address are U.S. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1204.52s)]
*  You are not a simulation. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1207.92s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1208.92s)]
*  Can you talk a little more, you mentioned it briefly, but can you talk a little more [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1209.92s)]
*  about what's been the real driver of this anti-DI backlash that started with the Supreme [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  Court decision last year that culminated into this energy that has tried to redefine what [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1224.56s)]
*  diversity, equity, and inclusion is, and given the fact that you have such a strong [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1236.84s)]
*  market, and I've told you for many, many years, what do you think is your thoughts on the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1241.56s)]
*  roots on this? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1250.56s)]
*  I think it started from a great place, and unfortunately, it's progressed to a point [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1252.84s)]
*  where it's eating its own tail. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  So in 1960, there were 12 blacks at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1259.9599999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1265.0s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1266.0s)]
*  Race-based affirmative action made sense back then. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1268.0s)]
*  The academic gap between black and white was double what it was between rich and poor. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1269.76s)]
*  Sixty years on, and this is a wonderful thing, a wonderful thing, 51% of Harvard's freshman [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1274.6s)]
*  class is non-white. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1280.3999999999999s)]
*  But here's the problem, 20% of those come from dual-income parent homes that are above-average [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1282.6399999999999s)]
*  income homes. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1287.56s)]
*  So letting in the Taiwanese daughter of a private equity billionaire is not diversity. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1288.56s)]
*  And this is another sign of our progress. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1295.6399999999999s)]
*  In America today, you'd rather be born non-white or gay than poor. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1297.56s)]
*  So I think we need to recognize our victory and our progress, but then figure out a way [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1305.08s)]
*  to come together, because DEI is causing a lot of problems, because what does happen [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1309.24s)]
*  with DEI? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1313.04s)]
*  People of color deserve advantage. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1314.32s)]
*  They've been treated really poorly. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1315.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1317.36s)]
*  Well, also the Japanese. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1318.36s)]
*  We interned the Japanese in concentration camps. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1319.36s)]
*  What about them? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1321.24s)]
*  What about women? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1322.24s)]
*  Think about all the shit women have taken. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1323.24s)]
*  Well, what about gay people? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1324.24s)]
*  For God's sakes, they've been persecuted. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1325.36s)]
*  And we ended up with a construct, an expensive construct, that has huge apparatus, and people [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1327.32s)]
*  that can never be fired, you can never question it, or you're called a racist if you ever [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1333.64s)]
*  efforts, right? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1337.8s)]
*  Where we're purposely advantaging 76% of the population. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1339.48s)]
*  The only people who are not advantaging are the 24% of people in America applying to college [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1345.0s)]
*  that are white and male. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1348.68s)]
*  So when you have an apparatus trying to advantage 76%, you're not advantaging them. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1349.8999999999999s)]
*  You're discriminating against the 24%. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1354.48s)]
*  So what's the solution? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1357.76s)]
*  Affirmative action is an amazing thing. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1359.56s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats all believe there are certain people with wins in their face [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1362.36s)]
*  that could use a hand up. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1366.44s)]
*  The key is, and I think that causes all the agita, is a misdirect. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1367.8400000000001s)]
*  It's around, okay, who qualifies? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1372.3600000000001s)]
*  The affirmative action should be based on color. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1374.48s)]
*  And that color should be green. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1377.64s)]
*  And by the way, this isn't new. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1381.28s)]
*  The University of California, since 1997, did away with race-based affirmative action [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1382.44s)]
*  and bases it on an adversity score. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1385.96s)]
*  I'm the beneficiary of affirmative action. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1388.2s)]
*  I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died a secretary. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1390.68s)]
*  My household income was never above $40,000. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1393.52s)]
*  So they gave me something called Pell Grants. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1396.24s)]
*  I couldn't have gone to college without affirmative action. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1398.56s)]
*  And I think that's the model right now. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1401.4s)]
*  Any visible characteristics we use for affirmative action creates a lot more problems than it [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1404.1200000000001s)]
*  solves. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1409.04s)]
*  It creates resentment. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1410.04s)]
*  And at universities, by the way, under the auspices of decrease my accountability and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1411.04s)]
*  increase my compensation, leadership, ethics, sustainability, DI, it is all bulls**t. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1415.44s)]
*  It is nothing but student debt. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1420.24s)]
*  We have decided that we are no longer centers of excellence, but we're agents of an orthodoxy, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1422.32s)]
*  that we're social engineers. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1426.9199999999998s)]
*  How f**king arrogant. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1428.2s)]
*  We're here to give you the skills so you can go do amazing research and create economic [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1430.32s)]
*  value and security for you and your family. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1434.3799999999999s)]
*  But no, let's create these huge departments called leadership. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1436.6s)]
*  I'm going to teach a kid how to be a leader or to be more ethical. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1439.4399999999998s)]
*  I can't get my 13-year-old to make his bed, but I'm supposed to help a 27-year-old become [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1443.6399999999999s)]
*  more ethical. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1448.3799999999999s)]
*  But here's the great thing about these departments. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1449.3799999999999s)]
*  There's no measurable outcome, so they never get fired. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1451.3s)]
*  Let's bring in these FIPs, formerly important people, pay them $300,000 to $400,000 for [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1454.06s)]
*  benefits and they'll teach leadership. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1457.74s)]
*  They basically get on stage and just talk about their war stories, about how f**king [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1460.1s)]
*  amazing they are. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1463.4199999999998s)]
*  And all it is is student debt on young people. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1464.46s)]
*  Get rid of all this bulls**t. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  You want to have affirmative action? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1469.18s)]
*  Take all that money and let in more kids. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1470.78s)]
*  Let in more gay kids. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1473.5s)]
*  Let in more trans kids. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1474.5s)]
*  Let in more black kids. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1475.5s)]
*  Let in more single mothers. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1476.5s)]
*  Let in more white kids from red states who happen to be Republican. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1477.5s)]
*  98% of Harvard's faculty is Democratic. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1480.7s)]
*  That's diversity. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1484.54s)]
*  So affirmative action is amazing. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1486.22s)]
*  It should just be based on need and adversity, not these physical, observable characteristics [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1488.5800000000002s)]
*  that create a lot more problems than they solve. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1494.0800000000002s)]
*  And instead of talking about who gets in, we should be talking about how many. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=1496.66s)]
