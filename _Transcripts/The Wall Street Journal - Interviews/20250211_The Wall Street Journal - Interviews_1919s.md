# Silicon Valley in Washington: Tech Leaders Debate Trump, AI and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA)
*  For a long time, Silicon Valley seemed to do everything it could to stay away from Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=0.0s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, you look at the inauguration and there's Zuckerberg and Bezos, Cook all [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=7.04s)]
*  sitting up front. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=13.08s)]
*  You've got Elon Musk, you've got David Sacks, you have all these 20-year-olds running around [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=14.08s)]
*  with Doge. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=19.92s)]
*  I keep hearing stories about, you know, serious venture capital types who are interviewing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=20.92s)]
*  for top jobs at Treasury and Commerce. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=26.92s)]
*  Is this a good thing to have this huge migration of tech people from the Valley to Washington? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=29.84s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure I agree with the premise of the question that this is the first time [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=36.72s)]
*  Silicon Valley has gone to D.C. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=40.76s)]
*  Actually, let's take something that happened pretty early on in the new administration, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=45.24s)]
*  which is the deregulation of AI. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=51.76s)]
*  The AI executive order by Biden was basically shut down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Basically it was like really burdening companies with a lot of safety measures before they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=65.6s)]
*  release a piece of software, a large language model. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=72.08s)]
*  A lot of us know in Silicon Valley who wrote this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=79.16s)]
*  It wasn't Biden who wrote this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=81.36s)]
*  It was Eric Schmidt and Reid Hoffman. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  So it's sort of like the Silicon Valley influence was there even in the Biden administration, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=86.16s)]
*  but it wasn't explicit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=93.28s)]
*  It was sort of like more of a shadow influence. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And then you go back to the Obama administration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  I worked at Facebook at the time and there was this rotating door between the Obama administration [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=100.8s)]
*  and the tech industry. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=107.68s)]
*  I will say though this time is different insofar it is more explicit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=110.04s)]
*  They're taking bigger roles in government, but I think it's largely a good thing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  A good thing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=123.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=124.64s)]
*  Now, Aaron, you supported Kamala Harris. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=125.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not like known for my political decisions in terms of picking the right outcome, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=128.48s)]
*  but you did. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=134.64s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=136.64s)]
*  And at one point you said something about David Sacks drinking too much Nyquil. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=137.64s)]
*  So you're on a different side of this, but what do you think about what's happening now? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't think any of us knew before the election that the outcome would be what it is, this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=150.48s)]
*  incredible... [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been an interesting journey. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=157.0s)]
*  I came out of the womb as a Democrat. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  So you came out of the womb. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=163.44s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=164.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=165.6s)]
*  I'll just ask my semi-hippie parents. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=167.56s)]
*  But basically, I've grown up Democrat. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=170.12s)]
*  Did all the Obama excitement, all that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=175.92s)]
*  And so I think there's a degree on a variety of topics tend to lean more to where the Democrats [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=181.4s)]
*  have historically been. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=189.88s)]
*  I think this was a really interesting election of starting to kind of see some of the fissures [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  of the party around business, around regulation, around more growth-oriented topics. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=197.52s)]
*  And so it was a tough election to kind of watch because I think the Democrats failed [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=204.16s)]
*  on a number of dimensions on being a party that could represent where the future of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=210.4s)]
*  country needed to go. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=215.6s)]
*  And so my interest in this election in particular was, hey, maybe if we get enough good ideas [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=218.68s)]
*  from the Democratic Party, that could hopefully on the margin veer policy or some decisions [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=225.2s)]
*  in a positive, productive direction. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=230.32s)]
*  But again, they lost the election. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=233.6s)]
*  So that didn't end up mattering. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=235.56s)]
*  But now as I kind of look at this new administration, I'm pretty excited about the amount of tech. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=237.88s)]
*  You are? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=243.12s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=244.12s)]
*  And why? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=245.12s)]
*  I mean, what do you see now that you didn't see then? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=246.12s)]
*  Well, I would still sort of posit a slightly different point. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=248.48s)]
*  I was really trying to make sure that the Democrat, anybody I would talk to on the Democrat [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=255.24s)]
*  side had very strong ideas that are actually very similar to the ones that this new administration [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=258.52s)]
*  is driving. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=264.72s)]
*  Again, wasn't particularly listened to on a number of these topics, but pro-growth, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=265.72s)]
*  less regulation, driving more of an abundance kind of oriented mindset, less regulation [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=271.6s)]
*  on AI, more kind of a tech-oriented mindset. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=276.52s)]
*  I'm not then extremely excited if that gets implemented by a different kind of party or [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=286.38s)]
*  So I think a lot of the people that we have entering the government are going to be great [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=287.38s)]
*  sort of stewards for the future of the kind of growth orientation that has come out of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  tech. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  To Amjad's point about AI is just one of these many examples of areas where we have sort [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=298.82000000000005s)]
*  of gotten to a point of over-regulation, which is going to completely harm our ability to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=303.74s)]
*  grow in the future and especially in a race with China, India. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=308.1s)]
*  Okay, so I'm trying to get a little disagreement going here to create some excitement before [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=311.38s)]
*  the end of the evening. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=315.98s)]
*  You guys are sounding like you're very much on the same page. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=316.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, the question for Aaron is that you said they're sort of not representing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=319.98s)]
*  this excitement for the future. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=327.5s)]
*  I would say it is much more sinister than that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=329.38s)]
*  What was happening with AI regulation is like an active effort to centralize and make [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=333.98s)]
*  it so that there's three or four companies that are controlling AI, make it so that startups [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  are not actually able... [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=343.32s)]
*  Do you think that's right, Aaron? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=344.54s)]
*  Do you think that... [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=345.54s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to spend too much time on the past. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=346.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=348.66s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=349.66s)]
*  Well, it probably won't be the past still because these are going to keep bouncing up, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=350.66s)]
*  at least as it relates to AI regulation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=355.22s)]
*  I totally take that point, and I lean very much more to the side of let a thousand flowers [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=358.3s)]
*  bloom in AI. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  If you just go back two years, I'll eventually kind of get to maybe the sympathetic view. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=369.66s)]
*  If you go back two years, there's this whole pause AI movement, and it was pause AI for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  six months. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=381.82s)]
*  Let's get our arms around this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=382.82s)]
*  Obviously, one massive inherent flaw was there's no central body of people that you could just [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=384.58s)]
*  get together, and then everybody's going to agree that now we have safety figured out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=390.17999999999995s)]
*  This has been a multi-decade problem that nobody can agree on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  Pause for six months until what? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=397.85999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, that would never work. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=399.26s)]
*  China, et cetera, would not adhere to the pause, so all you do is then fall behind relative [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=400.73999999999995s)]
*  to other countries. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=405.73999999999995s)]
*  And also, it was just so early in the technology that if you were to kind of quote unquote [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=407.46s)]
*  pause at this point, we would be in the later stages of the GPT-3 era of these models. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=411.98s)]
*  And just think about the N million or hundreds of millions of students all around the world [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  that now can be instantly educated by AI. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=427.22s)]
*  Think about the healthcare outcomes that now are much better because of AI being able to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=429.46s)]
*  automatically generate software. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=435.18s)]
*  So that pause AI would have stopped that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=436.26s)]
*  So I was very much against that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm very pro-open source AI. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  I think that unfortunately, we have not been able to convene a reasonable discussion about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  the different interests and the views in any kind of real kind of collective way. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=447.98s)]
*  I think there are fair arguments on one side about the risks of AI. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  I think, and I have friends that are deep in that space, and I appreciate hearing all [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  their views. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=462.1s)]
*  I don't agree with them from a policy standpoint, but I like that it's a conversation. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=463.1s)]
*  But Dom, to this point, also, you don't want those to be sort of behind the scenes, lobbying-driven [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=467.5s)]
*  decisions that impact the entire industry. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=472.5s)]
*  And I think that was obviously a big outcome of this election. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=475.5s)]
*  So let me go back to the question that Ben asked at the outset of this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=478.85999999999996s)]
*  How did we get to a point where Silicon Valley became so polarized? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=483.58s)]
*  I mean, we've seen the nation going in this direction for a long time. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=487.7s)]
*  But what happened in Silicon Valley? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=491.62s)]
*  And what are the effects? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, does it make it hard to run a firm? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  Do you have people on both sides of the great divide? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=496.62s)]
*  Well, if you look back over the last sort of 10, 15 years in Silicon Valley, it became [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  this sort of one party state. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=509.7s)]
*  It was Democrat. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  It was like all on the left. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=515.14s)]
*  All the culture was more left-wing oriented. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=517.74s)]
*  The way it represented in terms of moderating this big social networks, you would ban any [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=522.02s)]
*  sort of right-of-center ideas on Twitter. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=527.86s)]
*  And all of this came out in the Twitter files, on Facebook. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  You would ban the sitting president of the United States. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  And so there was overreach in all aspects of Silicon Valley. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=537.5s)]
*  A startup in 2017, 18, like P-quoke, is sort of like you feel like you're a drug dealer [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  or doing something wrong because employees are sort of constantly thinking of you as [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=553.38s)]
*  this sort of evil capitalist. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=559.26s)]
*  And so they go into these companies with an agenda. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=561.62s)]
*  It was like, oh, we're going to be activists. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=564.46s)]
*  And we're going to make sure technology companies or whatever are some idealistic, you told [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=567.22s)]
*  I don't want to spend a lot of time on the past here, but do you buy that description [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=575.06s)]
*  of the last 10 years? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=579.42s)]
*  I think that there's I probably have a slightly more nuanced view of how much the over rotation [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  impacted the internals of these companies. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=586.5s)]
*  But I wasn't at Facebook. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=589.9s)]
*  So I don't know how that showed up in daily censorship decisions or whatnot. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=590.9s)]
*  But I think that there is a lot of truth to the Valley did every iteration of new college [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=594.7399999999999s)]
*  grads and kind of as the ecosystem evolved, did veer more and more to the left and then [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=602.9399999999999s)]
*  in some cases, extreme left. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=608.5s)]
*  And I think there's obviously a moderate middle ground that a corporation should try and land [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=609.66s)]
*  in. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=615.18s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of different views from employees on a variety of topics. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=616.18s)]
*  I think it's totally appropriate for a company to not weigh in on every single thing that's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=620.06s)]
*  happening in the outside world. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=624.4599999999999s)]
*  Do you think this has been a helpful correction? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  I think you need a little bit of a reset every now and then to figure out and recalibrate [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=626.98s)]
*  where things should land in terms of how you run these organizations. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=630.98s)]
*  It's been an amazing correction. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=634.62s)]
*  Like honestly, like the levels of productivity that we're reaching now has been unheard of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=635.86s)]
*  because partly because people are able to hire the most competent people. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=641.78s)]
*  The AI being, you know, sort of not only wrong, illegal, you know, the Supreme Court kind [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  of ruled on that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=651.5s)]
*  And they knew Trump executive orders are making it very clear that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=652.7s)]
*  So you're OK with the percentage of women at most? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=656.3s)]
*  You just hired the most competent person. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=661.14s)]
*  Well, wait, there are tons of studies that show that's not the way the world works. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=663.06s)]
*  There's tons of studies that shows that the AI just failed and like didn't work. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=668.74s)]
*  I'm not defending the AI. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=672.54s)]
*  I'm saying, you know, there's been a big push towards, for instance, blind interviewing [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=674.18s)]
*  things like that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=679.0999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=680.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all that's great. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=681.0999999999999s)]
*  Because they show people naturally tend to hire people like themselves. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=682.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can do everything you want. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=684.3000000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you have, you know, two, three, five people in the interview process. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=685.78s)]
*  You can source them whatever way you like if you want to like make sure diversity is [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=691.86s)]
*  there. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=695.14s)]
*  At the end of the day, you pick the most competent person for the job. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=696.14s)]
*  Abolishing DEI a good thing for the Valley? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=698.98s)]
*  I'm probably going to keep answering in almost the same way. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=702.74s)]
*  I think there was an over rotation on certain dimensions. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=705.0600000000001s)]
*  I think that the idea, if you go back to at least before the extreme kind of maybe progressive [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=707.98s)]
*  implementation, the original idea of in some groups was like, how do we have more fair [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=714.14s)]
*  hiring practices? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=721.1s)]
*  How do we expand the reach of the tech industry? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=722.14s)]
*  It's an industry where if you kind of know about it, you come here, you can get a job. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=725.54s)]
*  If you don't, then it's a sort of closed off, isolated ecosystem. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=728.3s)]
*  And I think a lot of the original narrative of how do you open up tech to more people, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=731.9s)]
*  which didn't have to mean any particular demographic, just the idea of opening up tech, having more [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=737.22s)]
*  fair hiring practices so more people can find their way through the hiring funnel. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=742.3399999999999s)]
*  These are good things. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=747.42s)]
*  And I think again, we'll sort of find our way through the equilibrium to land there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=748.42s)]
*  Let's talk policy, specific policies. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=753.26s)]
*  And Aaron, let's start with antitrust. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  A lot of people feel like in terms of overreach, LenaCon at the FTC, you know, kind of shut [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  down. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=764.18s)]
*  We're going through each one, aren't we? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=765.18s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to do it all. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=766.18s)]
*  Well, it's the future of the country. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=767.18s)]
*  But are we in a better place with, are we in a better place on antitrust now than where [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=771.1s)]
*  we were? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=778.98s)]
*  So well, we're extremely early into this new administration. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=781.02s)]
*  We don't quite know where we are. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=785.46s)]
*  We don't quite know where we are. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=786.7s)]
*  And so I think you kind of have to just caveat with that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=787.98s)]
*  I would say that if you take a general pulse of the valley on a variety of topics, I think [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=791.7s)]
*  the view was that you couldn't do acquisitions in the past administration. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=799.62s)]
*  I think there was which, you know, big tech certainly felt bad about that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=803.18s)]
*  VCs couldn't get their exits. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=809.26s)]
*  And then small companies, there are these moments where actually you do need to sell [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=810.66s)]
*  your company or you do want to sell your company. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=814.3s)]
*  And so, you know, the idea that the government could try and kind of pre-predict which things [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=816.04s)]
*  are going to become monopolies, which is sort of the doctrine of the last antitrust, was [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=820.0s)]
*  anticipate what could eventually become monopolistic. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=826.34s)]
*  That's obviously gone, you know, goes too far. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=830.0600000000001s)]
*  And so most people in tech believe that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=831.98s)]
*  And I think we need to kind of... [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=834.22s)]
*  So again, a correction is a good thing. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=835.98s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  Where I actually favor Lena's sort of either agenda or spotlight is, and this is where [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=840.1800000000001s)]
*  you'd see a lot of, I think, appreciation from tech companies of all sizes. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=847.98s)]
*  I think I'll go talk to Daniel at Spotify, you know, Jeremy at Yelp or others. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=851.94s)]
*  You do have in the digital age more and more lock-in of digital platforms because once [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=857.3800000000001s)]
*  you have the data or the device or the search access, you control quite a bit of access [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=862.1800000000001s)]
*  to information and the flow of applications and value. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=867.5400000000001s)]
*  And so the question is, you know, should we sort of have a conversation around what does [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=870.82s)]
*  openness and sort of fair open interoperability mean with these digital platforms? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=875.0200000000001s)]
*  We didn't have this problem, you know, 150 years ago with railroads. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=880.9s)]
*  It's a new problem in the digital age. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=883.78s)]
*  Should we understand... [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=885.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, we had it with telephones and it required regulation. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=888.62s)]
*  But even that was sort of a data... [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=889.62s)]
*  That was more of an infrastructure issue, less data, and now we have a data version [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=891.02s)]
*  of this issue. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=895.36s)]
*  And I think it's actually totally reasonable that we think through what should modern digital [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=896.36s)]
*  antitrust look like. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=901.06s)]
*  And I'm trying to... [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=902.54s)]
*  What about you? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=903.54s)]
*  I mean, you were pointing to the problem of the big tech... [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=904.54s)]
*  The power of the big tech companies. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=907.94s)]
*  You're in favor of the small guys. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=909.46s)]
*  I mean, JD Vance said he kind of liked what Lina Khan was doing. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=910.7800000000001s)]
*  Where should we end up on antitrust? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=915.62s)]
*  Well, so, you know, I would like generalize the question as like, you know, what are the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=917.3800000000001s)]
*  abuse of power at these big tech companies? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=922.0400000000001s)]
*  For example, I think censorship has been like a really bad problem. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=924.5s)]
*  Like, you know, free speech is a fundamental thing in the United States. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=929.1800000000001s)]
*  They abused Section 230 to say that we're a neutral platform and they were acting like [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=934.54s)]
*  publishers. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=940.54s)]
*  And that probably had all these downstream effects on advertisement and what kind of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=942.26s)]
*  content you could put out there, what kind of advertising you could target. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=946.6999999999999s)]
*  Publishers had more liability than they had. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=951.86s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=954.18s)]
*  Under Section 230. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=955.18s)]
*  So I think there's signal from this new administration that there's going to be Section 230 reform. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=956.78s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=961.62s)]
*  So I think that the general attitude of this administration and the people around it, their [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=964.0600000000001s)]
*  advisors is actually looking in a more targeted way about the abuses of these big companies. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=968.82s)]
*  Let's move on to immigration. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=975.0200000000001s)]
*  I mean, Silicon Valley. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=976.58s)]
*  I'm just going through the issues. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=981.34s)]
*  I didn't make them up. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=982.7800000000001s)]
*  I didn't make them up. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=985.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is an industry that was built on immigration. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=986.5400000000001s)]
*  I suspect we have a few immigrants in the room. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=991.38s)]
*  Amjad, you're an immigrant. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  What do you think about your administration's, may I call them that? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=998.94s)]
*  Attack on immigration. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1004.98s)]
*  Are they attacking immigration? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1007.5s)]
*  They're pro-legal immigration. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1010.34s)]
*  I think Trump has sort of signaled or expressed like actually kind of a radical pro high skill [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1014.3399999999999s)]
*  immigration. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1023.9799999999999s)]
*  Like he said at one point that you want to staple sort of green cards on sort of. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1024.98s)]
*  Do you think we're going to see a twist here? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1029.74s)]
*  Illegal immigration gets cut back. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1032.1s)]
*  High skilled immigration gets increased. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1034.02s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1036.34s)]
*  Everyone around Trump, like, you know, Sachs, Elon, all these people, we're all aligned [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1038.5s)]
*  Well, not if C.Bannon. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1043.02s)]
*  That's not where C.Bannon is. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1044.3s)]
*  Is he part of the gang? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1045.54s)]
*  He has a lot to do with this whole zeitgeist. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  Aaron, what do you think? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1053.06s)]
*  Immigration? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1053.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that if you just this is this has been an interesting one for sure, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1054.5s)]
*  because I think if you just took Trump's views, I think you'd land with a fairly pro [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1061.9s)]
*  progressive immigration policy that is one that especially tech and the tech industry [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1069.42s)]
*  is sort of familiar with and comfortable with. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1074.7s)]
*  You know, he's talked about the staple, the green card. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1078.7s)]
*  There's been some recent videos where he actually talked about we're going to see a way greater [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1081.42s)]
*  number of immigration during this administration. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1085.74s)]
*  I think he might be in a position where he sort of doesn't have to always appease the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1090.86s)]
*  base as much. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1094.94s)]
*  He's not running for reelection. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1095.58s)]
*  So, you know, there's there's at least one optimistic kind of pathway here where he's [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1097.34s)]
*  sort of he's beyond the needing to do only the things for for the election motive and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1102.22s)]
*  actually can can push the country forward. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1109.02s)]
*  And then I totally agree with Amjad on if you look at the people that have now surrounded [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1111.02s)]
*  him in critical policy areas, especially that are tech related, these are either literally [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1115.02s)]
*  immigrants themselves or their companies are used to having incredible immigrants, you [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  know, drive their companies forward. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1126.94s)]
*  Elon is is unmistakably pro high skilled immigration. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  He's been very vocal about this on Twitter. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1131.74s)]
*  This guy, Sri Ram, who joined the administration for AI work, you know, it's an administration [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1134.22s)]
*  that has a lot of talent that is very directly has experienced immigration or has scale up [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1140.3s)]
*  organizations that have dealt with it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1146.7s)]
*  China. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1149.1s)]
*  Let's talk about China, which may be, by the way, the one issue where you can get a little [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1149.74s)]
*  bipartisan energy going. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1153.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1154.78s)]
*  Washington these days. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1154.94s)]
*  What what should we be doing on China? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1156.78s)]
*  What should we be doing on TikTok? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1159.98s)]
*  What should we be doing on DeepSeek? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1161.66s)]
*  What's the proper approach? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1163.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1165.66s)]
*  Well, so there are a few things there. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1166.06s)]
*  First of all, there's the question of our dependence on Taiwan with regards to TSMC. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1171.9s)]
*  And like, that's a huge dependency. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1180.06s)]
*  And, you know, that's a national security issue. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1182.3s)]
*  And so that the question was like, was Biden's approach correct with the Chips Act? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1185.8999999999999s)]
*  Subsidize. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1191.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1191.82s)]
*  You know, subsidize and do export control. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1192.46s)]
*  I think the export control are largely correct. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1195.34s)]
*  You weren't implemented very well. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1199.6599999999999s)]
*  Nvidia went around them and so on and so forth. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1201.74s)]
*  So I think there's more work to be done there. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1203.8999999999999s)]
*  But then, you know, the idea of like building the semiconductor industry here is just going too slow. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1207.18s)]
*  And so Trump's... [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1215.9s)]
*  So you favor it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1216.8600000000001s)]
*  You just don't think it's going fast enough. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1217.58s)]
*  It's not going fast enough. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1219.02s)]
*  I mean, if it's going to take 10, 20 years, maybe China has already taken Taiwan or something like that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1220.06s)]
*  So Trump's idea, and look, I'm not sure if it's the best idea, but it's an interesting idea, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1225.1000000000001s)]
*  is like if we put tariffs on all chips, including coming from Taiwan, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1229.98s)]
*  then it will activate the Apple, the NVIDIAs of the world to accelerate the process of building [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1234.3000000000002s)]
*  the semiconductor industry in the US. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1239.1000000000001s)]
*  And that's a simple sort of economic free market argument. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1241.3400000000001s)]
*  So like spring up those tariffs and see what the free market does. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1244.38s)]
*  You're in favor of that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1247.1000000000001s)]
*  Build a tariff wall. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1248.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm in favor of running the experiment, I guess, but we'll see. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1250.14s)]
*  Aaron. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1255.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1255.98s)]
*  I mean, I think maybe to go back to the election for one second, because it's a little bit of a... [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1256.22s)]
*  It connects back into this. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1261.42s)]
*  I think one of the biggest frustrations of anybody that has been in business and dealing with [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1262.6999999999998s)]
*  Democrat-led administrations is usually the intersection of what the stated goals of the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1269.9799999999998s)]
*  country are and how do we drive progress on those goals and then the regulation [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1276.3s)]
*  and regulatory environment of getting that done. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1280.78s)]
*  And the CHIPS Act is... [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1283.26s)]
*  I generally think it's positive because at least it puts a massive spotlight on the country, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1286.3s)]
*  on advanced semiconductor, go out and work in the country. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1290.38s)]
*  But there's a different tilt to that, which is like, let's go and figure out, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1295.42s)]
*  why commercially has that not been viable? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1301.1000000000001s)]
*  What about the cost and the expense of dealing with the regulations of building factories and [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1303.3400000000001s)]
*  building data centers? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1310.14s)]
*  Why are people leaving the country to go do this work? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1311.1000000000001s)]
*  Why don't we have the talent here? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1313.98s)]
*  Why aren't they trained up here? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1315.18s)]
*  How do we actually figure out how you stimulate the building and the development of that without [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1317.18s)]
*  just having to throw money... [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1323.42s)]
*  More than just subsidies. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1324.54s)]
*  It's education. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1325.9s)]
*  I think it's time for a different approach. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1329.34s)]
*  The tariff is one tool in that tool belt. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1331.58s)]
*  But if you just actually expand out to other major topics, why don't we lead in drones? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1335.34s)]
*  Why don't we lead in solar production? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1340.54s)]
*  Why don't we lead in new forms of energy? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1342.78s)]
*  So do we have a tariff policy? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1346.7s)]
*  We need to deregulate these things. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1349.34s)]
*  We need to make it easier for businesses to get started and to get funded and to be able to scale [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1351.1s)]
*  in all of these sectors. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1356.62s)]
*  And you feel more optimistic about that today than you might have before the election? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1357.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, again, this is sort of my angle on why I was willing to kind of support on the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1363.02s)]
*  Democrat side was this idea of why don't we drive an acceleration angle on a number of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1368.22s)]
*  critical policy areas. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1373.1000000000001s)]
*  Who knows if that would have actually worked or been implemented. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1374.46s)]
*  But I only care about the success of America vis-a-vis politics. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1377.66s)]
*  And so we have a new administration and I am very hopeful and optimistic that we can get a [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1382.94s)]
*  lot of this done. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1388.22s)]
*  Energy is a very important topic as well with regards to AI. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1389.8200000000002s)]
*  The game in AI. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1395.26s)]
*  People misinterpreted deep seek. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1397.42s)]
*  It's like, oh, you're going to spend $5 million and get a state of the art sort of model. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1398.78s)]
*  And that is not true. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1405.8200000000002s)]
*  It's probably true that the final training run was $5 million, but it probably took hundreds of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1408.46s)]
*  million dollars to run the experiments to produce deep seek. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1413.74s)]
*  And so the game going forward will continue to be scaling compute. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1419.66s)]
*  And so Sam Altman went up, second day of the administration says we're going to build a $500 [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1425.74s)]
*  billion data center. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1430.54s)]
*  That's massive. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1433.8999999999999s)]
*  How much energy? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1435.82s)]
*  Do we even have energy? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1436.54s)]
*  It will come from Greenland. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1439.18s)]
*  Geothermal. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1440.54s)]
*  Questions or comments? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1445.5s)]
*  All of you have been thinking about this. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1446.86s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1448.3s)]
*  I tend to agree with you, Aaron, and please correct me if I'm incorrect. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1448.7s)]
*  I can't remember the last time I saw Google or Twitter or Facebook come out of Europe [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1461.9s)]
*  because there's just a pure amount of huge regulation that is happening now. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1467.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1472.22s)]
*  And again, as I said, I 100% agree with you. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1473.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1476.22s)]
*  Oh, there's not a but? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1476.94s)]
*  Usually there's always a but. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1478.3000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, for I think, depending on your views on this, for our European friends, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1482.14s)]
*  there was a chart, you probably saw this, of the amount of $50 billion plus companies [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1488.0600000000002s)]
*  that have been created. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1492.8600000000001s)]
*  I think 50 billion was the right number. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1493.5800000000002s)]
*  I could be wrong on the metric. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1494.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's a doozy. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1496.7s)]
*  In the past, I don't know, 50 years or something, the US versus Europe, it's like a 101 or [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1499.1000000000001s)]
*  something. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1506.38s)]
*  The numbers are just insane. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1506.8600000000001s)]
*  Now, is that regulation? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1508.46s)]
*  Is that a lack of a venture capital flywheel? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1510.22s)]
*  We have something very special in the US. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1514.22s)]
*  We should not squander that on both sides. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1516.7s)]
*  My worry about the extreme right would be that you kill the golden goose on immigration. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1521.8200000000002s)]
*  And the thing I worry about on the extreme left is you kill the golden goose, which is [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1528.7s)]
*  the capital flywheel and the investment flywheel that we have. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1532.38s)]
*  And you don't want to screw with either of those things. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1535.9s)]
*  There is a sort of a moderate approach that you probably want to pull the best ideas on [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1537.74s)]
*  both sides and kind of squeeze them together on this. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1542.0600000000002s)]
*  Who else? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1546.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes, back there. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1547.26s)]
*  And please identify yourself before your question. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1551.02s)]
*  I'm Doug Reinhart, Chief Product Officer with Go Digital Media Group. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1553.42s)]
*  I'll just tag on to that. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1556.5400000000002s)]
*  What if the best ideas are in China? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1557.74s)]
*  Then we've got a problem. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1561.5800000000002s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1564.5400000000002s)]
*  What is that? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1565.74s)]
*  Explain why that's a problem. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1566.54s)]
*  If the best ideas in China, you're saying? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1567.98s)]
*  If they are in China. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1569.74s)]
*  You just said the best ideas. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1570.54s)]
*  What if the best ideas are actually in China? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1572.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, DeepSeek was, there's quite a few innovations there that wasn't really covered by the press. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1575.1799999999998s)]
*  There's this algorithm called R10. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1582.22s)]
*  And basically, you can train a model to do reasoning similar to O1 [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1585.1s)]
*  with very little supervision, cheaply and scalably. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1591.18s)]
*  And I think it was this gift to the world by open sourcing it and kind of putting the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1596.46s)]
*  research out there. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1602.7s)]
*  And it's honestly shameful that we don't see that from US companies. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1604.06s)]
*  Everyone just closed down. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1607.34s)]
*  There's no research that are happening. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1608.94s)]
*  But so do we block them off or do we embrace it and learn from it? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1610.62s)]
*  Well, I think you embrace open research wherever it's coming from. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1613.74s)]
*  Because otherwise, we're going to be blocked off. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1618.3s)]
*  Everyone will do open research. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1620.8600000000001s)]
*  And this is where I disagree with Trump's response to DeepSeek, this hyper competitive [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1623.02s)]
*  approach, which is like, no, actually, if there are good ideas from there in the open [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1629.9s)]
*  research, we should embrace them and build on them. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1633.74s)]
*  But honestly, the US is known for the radical ideas. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1639.26s)]
*  I don't think we're going to have a problem with that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1643.18s)]
*  We're always going to have ideas there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1645.9s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1647.74s)]
*  Sai Yadavalli, CIO at Lee-Wanowa. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1651.1s)]
*  Just then why put export controls? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1654.86s)]
*  Actually, ironically, the export controls led to DeepSeek because they had to be efficient [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1659.66s)]
*  due to elite. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1667.18s)]
*  I mean, you don't think so? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1668.06s)]
*  You think that they worked around it all through Singapore or something? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1669.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, the innovations they made were, I don't want to say obvious, but on the path. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1673.02s)]
*  It wasn't like they arrived at something that was... [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1681.58s)]
*  But if you were not compute constrained at all, would we have run into them at the same [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1683.02s)]
*  timeline? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1686.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1687.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1687.5s)]
*  All right, then good export control. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1688.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1689.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, again, there's a national security aspect of it, like weapons and things like [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1690.62s)]
*  that and autonomous drones. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1696.62s)]
*  I'm not really an expert in that, but I think you need to think about these things. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1699.18s)]
*  Gentlemen, last question. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1704.22s)]
*  Because we've talked about a lot of different things, but if the new administration could [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1706.14s)]
*  change just one thing to help the development of technology, what would that one thing be? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1711.66s)]
*  What's the top thing on your priority list that you think needs to be changed? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1720.3s)]
*  Well, my wish list would be an EO on high school immigration. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1725.58s)]
*  I think that there's been too much noise in the past couple of months around this topic. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1729.5s)]
*  I think that Trump coming into the election had some very clear messages. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1735.18s)]
*  I'd love to see those stamped from a policy standpoint to kind of end the noise, in particular [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1739.82s)]
*  because I think you have... [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1746.54s)]
*  There's some kids out there right now that are like the highest aptitude kids in the [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1750.06s)]
*  world in some other country, and they're going to have to make the decision of, is U.S. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1753.98s)]
*  the place to come? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1758.54s)]
*  Is it worth it? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1759.5s)]
*  Is this an environment that they want to come into? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1760.14s)]
*  I think Trump specifically individually has the right message on that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1763.9s)]
*  I think a lot of his policy advisors do. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1767.98s)]
*  I'd love to see it just locked in. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1769.98s)]
*  So basically just the message he ran on. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1773.34s)]
*  Let's get an EO on that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1775.66s)]
*  Amjad, one thing. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1776.7s)]
*  I think opening up the government for Silicon Valley to be able to modernize it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1778.54s)]
*  The systems there are very, very old. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1785.98s)]
*  That's also a national security risk that also just makes our lives as citizens a lot worse. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1788.3s)]
*  The government could be providing better services. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1796.3s)]
*  It could be a lot more efficient. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1798.54s)]
*  Silicon Valley knows how to do that, but in the past it hasn't been... [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1800.54s)]
*  Great. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1803.58s)]
*  Can I... [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1804.08s)]
*  You're going to do two. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1804.58s)]
*  It's not a single thing, but let me just extend one random thing. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1807.02s)]
*  So I think you need, whether it's governors or even more local in some cases, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1810.54s)]
*  I think you do need a little bit of a radical change throughout the country on [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1817.82s)]
*  why is it so hard to build? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1821.98s)]
*  Why is it so hard to grow? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1823.6599999999999s)]
*  Why don't we have housing in California? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1824.78s)]
*  We've been talking about this for 15 years. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1829.1s)]
*  The cost of housing has well exceeded all of the raw materials in the world [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1830.78s)]
*  that you can imagine going into these things. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1836.54s)]
*  Why is it so hard to build data centers, energy, housing, cars, self-driving systems? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1838.86s)]
*  Why don't we have a race of governors saying, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1845.34s)]
*  I'm going to go and improve my country, my state on working on these issues? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1848.46s)]
*  And I think one thing that Trump is uniquely good at is he has the ability to convene [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1852.94s)]
*  and he has the ability to put these commercial spotlights on things. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1859.5s)]
*  I think the Stargate thing was super interesting because, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1862.62s)]
*  sure, I think these companies were probably going to be building data centers. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1865.26s)]
*  They were probably going to be doing these investments, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1867.8999999999999s)]
*  but he just got Massa to ratchet up. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1869.9799999999998s)]
*  He got Larry to... [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1872.4599999999998s)]
*  If he could say, let's be a country of building and how do we use these levers of... [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1875.6599999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1881.26s)]
*  I think you got the worst anti-Trump guy on stage. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1882.78s)]
*  I was going to say, who knew we would end the evening with the rousing defense of Donald Trump [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1887.26s)]
*  from Aaron Levy. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1892.06s)]
*  Gentlemen, I hope both of you consider taking sabbaticals and going to Washington. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnRsvKoroA&t=1893.98s)]
