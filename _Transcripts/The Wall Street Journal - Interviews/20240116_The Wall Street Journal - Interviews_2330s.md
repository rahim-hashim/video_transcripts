# Shell CEO on Pausing Red Sea Shipments, AI, China and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY)
*  So, like I said, one year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=0.0s)]
*  Does it feel like the honeymoon is over? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=3.0s)]
*  Does it feel like three weeks? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=5.98s)]
*  Does it feel like three years? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=7.26s)]
*  I thought I misheard you at the beginning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=9.68s)]
*  One year sentence. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=11.48s)]
*  So, no, it's been much better than that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=12.48s)]
*  It's been a year indeed and it's been honestly a privilege to be in this position. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=15.72s)]
*  It's one of those things you pinch yourself at every single day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Having been in the company for 25 years and having had the privilege of serving under [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=24.66s)]
*  Ben as well to be able to build on his legacy is something really special. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=29.0s)]
*  Look, the world is in a challenging place politically, economically, socially and of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=34.6s)]
*  course from a climate perspective and so it's a responsibility that I cherish and I take [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=41.68s)]
*  very, very seriously. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=48.44s)]
*  It's been a year where I think we've made a lot of good progress. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=50.6s)]
*  Really proud of how we've been able to focus the organization, really try to embed performance [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=53.96s)]
*  discipline and simplification in all that we do on the financial side, on the way we [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=58.5s)]
*  measure our methane emissions, on the way we are driving our low carbon businesses. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=63.8s)]
*  But it's also been a world where the polarization in some areas I think has continued to grow [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=69.74s)]
*  and so navigating that is the challenge that I suspect we will continue to have for many [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=73.86s)]
*  years to come. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=79.0s)]
*  Yes, the polarization. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=80.0s)]
*  We'll come back to that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=81.0s)]
*  So do you have kind of a biggest surprise? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=82.26s)]
*  I mean, you're obviously not new to Shell. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=85.06s)]
*  You've been there since 30, how many years? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=87.66s)]
*  26 years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=92.02s)]
*  26, okay, sorry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=93.02s)]
*  Do you have any, are there any surprises sitting in the top seat that kind of stand out to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  you? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=101.06s)]
*  You know, a lot of it you can rationalize and intellectualize because indeed I have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=102.06s)]
*  been on the executive committee for a few years before I stepped into the CEO role. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=108.14s)]
*  I think the nature of the dialogue and it is of course a broader dialogue around the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=112.74s)]
*  energy transition that has multiple facets and we are collectively trying to get to a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=119.38s)]
*  world where you fundamentally change the energy system that it's taken us over a century to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=125.5s)]
*  build and we need to change it quickly if we are to achieve the climate ambitions from [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=130.1s)]
*  Paris but also a company like ours has set to be net zero by 2050. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=135.62s)]
*  And so maybe the biggest challenge has been how to find the right balance of the emotional [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=140.02s)]
*  and the rational to be able to have the discussions in a collaborative way, in particular with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=145.9s)]
*  the trio of governments, our customers and the energy suppliers so that we can actually [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=151.62s)]
*  move in a just transition at the pace that is required. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=158.06s)]
*  That I would argue has been the biggest challenge and one that I don't expect to become easier [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=161.62s)]
*  this year. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  Well let's dive a little bit into the news and the context of that news. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  So you announced this morning that, or not you personally, but Shell is selling a Nigerian [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=171.98s)]
*  onshore subsidiary and also Shell is one of many companies that regularly send cargoes [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  through the Red Sea and everybody is talking about the impact of the Red Sea, shipping [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=184.7s)]
*  and the cost of getting goods around the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=190.38s)]
*  You've suspended at least for a period of time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=195.06s)]
*  Can you tell us what's going on there? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=198.02s)]
*  What are your plans and how are you assessing this? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=199.62s)]
*  Firstly, the priority is the welfare of our people and of course protecting our assets. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=203.06s)]
*  So that's how we've been looking at this from the beginning. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=210.02s)]
*  We have continued to be able to cross the Bab el Minda, the Red Sea crossing until recently [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=213.54s)]
*  as you rightly said. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=220.58s)]
*  We continue to look at this on a daily basis. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  We're monitoring the situation and assessing at what point we can continue to cross. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=224.86s)]
*  At the heart of this is just the nature of where things are in the world today. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=232.22000000000003s)]
*  Geopolitics, whether it is Russia-Ukraine, whether it is Israel-Russia, whether it is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  the broader context in the region, companies like ours have to focus on what we can control [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  and at the heart of what we're trying to do is to make sure we get energy to our customers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=249.5s)]
*  What this does of course is it makes it more difficult to do so as you see trade flows [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=254.86s)]
*  starting to shift. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=259.26s)]
*  But also something like a Red Sea closure is taking an extra couple of weeks to be able [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=261.9s)]
*  to move a cargo around and it's starting to create a bit of a constraint on the shipping side. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=265.58s)]
*  Can you quantify the cost of that, like on a per barrel basis or cargo ship basis? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=269.82s)]
*  Look, I won't put a number against it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=275.82s)]
*  What we see in general is a 5 to 10% bump up in overall cost of delivered goods. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=277.74s)]
*  Because of the challenges? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=285.1s)]
*  Because of the challenges and because of the extra distance you have to sail, but also [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=286.38s)]
*  the fact that the broader shipping fleet is now trying to figure out exactly what you do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=291.58s)]
*  Now, what's lovely about the energy system in general and trade flows in general is they [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=296.7s)]
*  adapt over time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=301.74s)]
*  And so this is the reaction to what is still a short-lived reality. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=303.42s)]
*  We'll have to see whether this becomes a longer standing issue. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=307.98s)]
*  So that's what I think everyone is assessing and trying to monitor. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=311.98s)]
*  Okay, so you have like a call every day to like in the morning or to assess what the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=314.86s)]
*  next move is, whether you stick with the status quo? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=322.54s)]
*  The team monitors it literally on a daily basis, if not a minute basis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=326.3s)]
*  Okay, interesting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=329.5s)]
*  Let's talk about consolidation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=331.66s)]
*  It was a year of massive deals in the industry last year. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=333.26s)]
*  You're Exxon, Chevron, I mean the list goes on, Oxy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  Where does that leave Shell? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=341.98s)]
*  Do you feel that you need to do something to compete in this newly consolidated world? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  And if so, how do you go about assessing what you need to do? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=352.38s)]
*  Let's start with what are we trying to achieve? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=356.7s)]
*  And when are you buying BP? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  That seems to be, I've been interested over the last 24 hours here, less than 24 hours, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=362.46s)]
*  I think I've had that question eight times. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=366.94s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=368.94s)]
*  If I go back to what are we trying to do as a company, we've set very, very clear ambitions [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=369.94s)]
*  to be able to achieve net zero by 2050. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=374.46s)]
*  And we said we want to be the investment case through the energy transition. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  The transition is one that I won't pretend to sit here and tell you exactly how it's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=383.74s)]
*  going to play out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=387.74s)]
*  The one thing we do see and one thing we're trying to grapple with is the pace of the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=388.74s)]
*  transition in different locations. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  And so what we are trying to do is build a business that is going to thrive by delivering [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=395.94s)]
*  the energy that the world needs today, as well as positioning ourselves to take advantage [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=400.5s)]
*  of what I think will be unbelievably exciting opportunities in the energy transition. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=405.06s)]
*  Exactly how that is going to happen is still work in progress. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=410.42s)]
*  That is something we are learning literally on a day-to-day basis. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=414.04s)]
*  And so where do we sit with the consolidation? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=418.02s)]
*  Of course, we watch the consolidation keenly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=420.62s)]
*  I am absolutely convinced that the biggest value for a company like Shell today is unlocking [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=424.58s)]
*  the latent value that we have from the company through multiple different levers. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=430.5s)]
*  We've talked about we are spending more than we should, so focusing on our cost structure, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=435.14s)]
*  also on our capital expense, really being focused in the areas where we can create impact, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=440.26s)]
*  including in the energy transition. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=446.74s)]
*  We had dispersed ourselves too broadly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=448.5s)]
*  We're trying to focus on the handful of things that play to our competitive strength, like [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=450.58s)]
*  in the transport and industry sectors, where we do have a latent advantage, leveraging [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=454.74s)]
*  our trading arms and leveraging our customer relationships. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=459.86s)]
*  Being able to unlock that value, and now even more so with the possibilities being generated [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  through AI, I think is the premier value opportunity for us today. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=469.53999999999996s)]
*  So you're not interested in doing a big deal. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=475.86s)]
*  You feel like you need to clean your own house and fulfill the promises that you've made [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=479.18s)]
*  in your first year before you contemplate something non-organic. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  We always look at bolt-on opportunities and the like, but the major in organic is not [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=491.90000000000003s)]
*  on our radar screen and will not be through the course of this year. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=498.06s)]
*  It is very much a year of consolidation and delivering on the promises we made. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=501.5s)]
*  We've made some very clear promises to the market. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=506.54s)]
*  We gave ourselves 10 quarters to deliver on those. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=509.5s)]
*  We're two quarters into it, and we've just started the third quarter. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=512.02s)]
*  This is all about delivering the promises, both on the financials as well as our carbon [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=515.54s)]
*  commitments that we have made. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=520.26s)]
*  So we're hearing a lot about job cuts. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=523.02s)]
*  You mentioned costs. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=525.9s)]
*  How do you approach—I think you were 93,000 employees at the end of the year. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=528.66s)]
*  That was 10,000 more than the year before. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=534.62s)]
*  That is a massive leap for any company, especially when you're trying to prove to investors [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=537.9s)]
*  that you're going to be more disciplined. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=544.06s)]
*  So how deeply do you need to cut at Shell? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=546.86s)]
*  Can you give us any numbers? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=552.3s)]
*  Can you elucidate? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=553.62s)]
*  No, so this is not, in my mind, at all a question of cutting people left, right, and center. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=555.58s)]
*  This is very much a focus on where do we want to be in the energy transition. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=562.62s)]
*  A big part of the 10,000 jump that you referred to was acquiring a lot of small companies [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=566.9s)]
*  that we are looking to integrate into Shell. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=571.7s)]
*  The singular priority for now is to be able to be very clear how we can achieve the targets [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=576.1s)]
*  we have set. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=581.34s)]
*  First and foremost, from a cost reduction perspective, that involves portfolio choices [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=582.8s)]
*  that we have made and that we are executing. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  Because of course, a big part of the cost structure is when you have spread yourselves [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=590.4599999999999s)]
*  too thin, you have all the costs that are incurred by just carrying those businesses. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=594.3599999999999s)]
*  So we have, for example, announced and completed the divestment of Shell Energy Retail in the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=599.12s)]
*  UK. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=604.8399999999999s)]
*  We have recently announced the divestment of our Singapore energy and chemical parks. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  We have announced the divestment of our Pakistan footprint. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=612.64s)]
*  So those, it's really identifying what are the businesses that don't have a place in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  the organization, first and foremost. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=619.52s)]
*  Is there a lot more of that to come, divestments of that scale? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  I won't say there's a lot more to come, but we will continue to really focus on the areas [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=625.2s)]
*  that we think we can play in, and that means there will be some parts of the organization [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=629.96s)]
*  that are maybe more value-creative sitting outside of Shell rather than inside of Shell. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=634.32s)]
*  I won't give a dimension of how many of those, but it's fair to say that there's more to come. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  The broader-than picture around how do we continue to drive costs down is not just portfolio, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  but how can we be more efficient in the way that we run our business, also using elements [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=651.08s)]
*  like Gen.AI and the like, and where appropriate, making very, very focused and surgical moves [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  to be able to lean out an organization. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=662.36s)]
*  We also recognize we have a complex structure, and so we're trying to simplify it, starting [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=665.52s)]
*  from the top of the house, and simplify it not just in terms of people, but simplify [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=670.52s)]
*  it in terms of the targets that we are pursuing, making that shorter, sharper, and much clearer [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=675.02s)]
*  to the organization. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=679.54s)]
*  So where is artificial intelligence most exciting for you? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=681.12s)]
*  Is it in exploration? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=684.52s)]
*  Is it in trading? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=687.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're a massive, if not the most massive, energy trader on the globe, on the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=688.2199999999999s)]
*  planet, so how do you see the applications being kind of most useful in the near term, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=694.16s)]
*  in the next couple of years, let's say? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=702.36s)]
*  It's literally playing across our businesses at the moment, trading being one exciting, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=705.16s)]
*  one in our subsurface opportunities, some of the energy transition opportunities. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=709.12s)]
*  At the heart of it, though, there is a big part of the step-up that I have talked to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  the market about is enhancing performance. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=718.76s)]
*  AI right now is playing a big role there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=723.28s)]
*  So we are one of the, if not the largest player in creating a preventative maintenance program [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=725.36s)]
*  around the world. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=732.42s)]
*  So we have two key hubs, one in India, one in the US. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=733.42s)]
*  We process around five trillion aggregated rows of data, coming from around five million [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  sensors that we have across our operations. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=743.42s)]
*  Like offshore, onshore oil? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=745.76s)]
*  Offshore, onshore, everything. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=747.64s)]
*  We have digital twins that are being rolled out across the patch, which with the support [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=749.56s)]
*  of Gen.AI allows our operators to have a lot more insights in the way that they can start [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=753.14s)]
*  to predict where failures might occur and to intervene before we have any challenges. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  We are seeing significant value that is coming through from that. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=763.88s)]
*  But that's not just in the operation space. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=767.52s)]
*  We see it in areas like methane traceability. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=769.8s)]
*  One of the key focus areas we have in our energy transition is reducing methane leaks, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=772.5999999999999s)]
*  not just in Shell, but supporting others. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=776.56s)]
*  And with AI at the moment, you're being able to become much clearer on how we can actually [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=779.76s)]
*  trace methane so that we can go and address the source problems around it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=784.6s)]
*  I can give you multiple examples in areas like safety as well. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=789.12s)]
*  We are seeing step changes in safety performance. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=792.3399999999999s)]
*  The biggest barrier right now is that our imagination is not catching up with the technology [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=796.04s)]
*  that's out there, and we just need to continue to reimagine how we have always done business [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  and challenge the paradigms that have over the last five decades or so dictated the way [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=804.6s)]
*  we show up to do our work every single day. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=809.48s)]
*  How many people do you have who are dedicated to applying AI to your businesses relative [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=811.96s)]
*  to a couple of years ago? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  Like roughly? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=818.8800000000001s)]
*  Look, we've had for around a decade, we have built up a capability of hundreds of people [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=819.8800000000001s)]
*  that are just specialists in this domain. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=827.0s)]
*  That domain though, so we're talking hundreds. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=829.7600000000001s)]
*  But that's not where the magic is showing up. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=833.48s)]
*  The magic is showing up by taking people who are closer to the front line, who understand [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=836.32s)]
*  the system that we're trying to improve, and then bringing in the specialists and doing [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=840.6s)]
*  these sprints that allow us to focus on solving the problems that are worth solving. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=845.08s)]
*  And it's the connectivity. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=850.72s)]
*  And that's difficult because we're having to almost create new ecosystems for that to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  happen. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=857.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=858.4s)]
*  So I want to ask you, almost a year ago in Houston when we spoke, you were, you know, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=859.6s)]
*  just gotten started, well you got started the year before, but you said that you were [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=866.8399999999999s)]
*  just going to, you were fully expecting that there was no way you were going to really [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=872.64s)]
*  make anyone happy. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=877.36s)]
*  You were prepared to make a lot of people angry, it's part of the job. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=878.8s)]
*  How do you feel about that now? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=885.0s)]
*  I mean, there are people from every angle, louder than ever voices in your ears about [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=886.16s)]
*  how fast or how slow you should go in the energy transition, whether you're doing enough [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=894.8s)]
*  in low carbon investing, you know, saying you're going to let your customers lead the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=900.4s)]
*  way in your strategy. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=905.4s)]
*  I mean, how do you keep the long term view when, and your investors are looking at quarter [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  by quarter, you have a lot of hedge fund investors and shorter term investors. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=915.02s)]
*  How do you keep the long view? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=920.78s)]
*  I mean, because your capital investments are a decade or longer off. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=922.82s)]
*  Look, I think one has to go back to the purity of what we're trying to do. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=928.58s)]
*  We are not looking to optimize for short term gains. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=935.14s)]
*  We have a duty to our shareholders to look at the long term while making sure we deliver [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=938.02s)]
*  short term returns. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not an is it this or that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=944.18s)]
*  I think you're exactly right to say, Jenny, that it is a very loud debate. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=946.4599999999999s)]
*  Just before I came out here, I was at another event where it was around 120 of us. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=955.0999999999999s)]
*  And the first session was on AI, the second session was on energy. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=961.02s)]
*  It was fabulous to sort of just reflect at the end of it coming here. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=964.4599999999999s)]
*  The AI session was 120 people asking experts on AI, help me understand. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=968.3s)]
*  The energy session was everyone telling the other one what the right answer was. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=975.18s)]
*  Sometimes with different data sets. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=982.9s)]
*  I am a bigger believer today than I even was when I started that the way we're going to [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=986.62s)]
*  be able to truly transition is not to put our head in the sand, but to actually have [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=992.54s)]
*  the dialogues and continue to learn. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=997.58s)]
*  The privilege of a position like mine is you get to hear so many different perspectives [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=999.82s)]
*  and every single one of them challenges your own paradigm. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1003.9s)]
*  Then you go back and you sort of try to understand what is the data telling me. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1006.5s)]
*  I do think this is going to have to be a much broader discussion around the choices we need [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1011.22s)]
*  to make. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1017.54s)]
*  We are making a choice to put 10 to 15 billion dollars in a three year period between 2023 [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1018.74s)]
*  and 2025 because we fundamentally believe there are value opportunities there. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1023.98s)]
*  We call it more value with less emissions. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1028.22s)]
*  It's not because I'm trying to appease anyone, but that's because we see incredibly exciting [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1030.78s)]
*  opportunities for the future where you can a company like Shell is uniquely positioned [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1035.58s)]
*  with our trading capability, with our customer interface, with the relationships we have [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1040.58s)]
*  and with our system understanding to create something that is unique. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1044.94s)]
*  We are at the confluence of biotechnology with our bio products, energy and technology, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1049.3s)]
*  digital technology. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1057.3s)]
*  I mean what a fabulous place to be, but it's not going to be easy. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1058.3s)]
*  And so I welcome the many voices, many of whom, if not most of whom, will disagree with [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1063.3s)]
*  some of the choices I make. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1068.5s)]
*  My biggest learning over the last year has been I focus too much on with my team working [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1070.98s)]
*  it and then giving an output rather than actually working on sharing the dilemmas that we are [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1076.7s)]
*  going through and how we got to the conclusions we got to. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1081.82s)]
*  And hopefully through that process we start to actually bring to life some of the realities [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1085.26s)]
*  around what are we seeing? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1090.46s)]
*  What's the affordability of this? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1091.9s)]
*  What are our customers saying? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1093.58s)]
*  What's the government doing? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1095.22s)]
*  Hopefully that allows us to move forward. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1097.06s)]
*  I mean you've spoken before about the government needing to do more to lead the transition [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1098.54s)]
*  in policy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1105.54s)]
*  You've spoken on earnings calls about this. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1106.54s)]
*  But I mean that always seems to go, that public debate always seems, especially in an election [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1109.78s)]
*  year which we're about to, which we're already into, but it always seems to go to cheaper [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1115.7s)]
*  energy rather than, I mean the IRA is a huge, we'll talk about that, but I mean waiting [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1123.5s)]
*  for the government to lead the way doesn't really seem like a strategy. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1132.62s)]
*  And critics will say that letting your customers lead the way is a cop out. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1139.22s)]
*  What would you say to that? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1145.22s)]
*  I agree with both. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1147.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't think depending on the government is a strategy and I don't think waiting for [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  the customers is the answer. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1152.1799999999998s)]
*  I do think all three coming together is going to be critical. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1153.62s)]
*  Companies like ours I think are uniquely positioned to be able to bring some of our technological [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1157.12s)]
*  insights but also system understandings to the dialogue. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1163.36s)]
*  The reality is in some of the areas where you want to get traction, you're going to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1167.1599999999999s)]
*  be able to need support to be able to create investable and economic outcomes. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1171.28s)]
*  That's where governments need to step in, not just in terms of setting the policy but [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1176.52s)]
*  then removing the obstacles such as the permitting requirements and the like, making that much [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1179.54s)]
*  more flexible to respond to realities. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1184.72s)]
*  And similarly with the customers, I've had great debates with customers where the customer [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  says hey this is what I want. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1191.4s)]
*  And then when they come to ask for it and I say well this is the bill, they walk away [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1194.14s)]
*  and say give me the cheaper option. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1200.3200000000002s)]
*  And therefore it cannot. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1203.3600000000001s)]
*  Can you give us an example like sustainable aviation fuel or? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  Less so sustainable aviation fuel, more so in areas like green hydrogen. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1208.44s)]
*  It is still costly to produce green hydrogen. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1214.24s)]
*  We are investing in a 200 megawatt facility in Rotterdam to be able to do that and we're [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1217.08s)]
*  learning massively from it but we don't have external customers yet because it's expensive. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1221.68s)]
*  For your own use. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1226.36s)]
*  Right now we're using it for ourselves but we continue to look the market at the others [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1227.36s)]
*  to see whether we can build a market around it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1230.64s)]
*  And I can understand them. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1233.4s)]
*  It's significantly more expensive than the alternative. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1235.04s)]
*  I can't expect my customer to simply pay significantly more unless there is a framework where the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  government is either incentivizing or penalizing to be able to make that the obvious choice. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1246.16s)]
*  And so in no way and if I've sent that message in the past I did not mean to. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1251.0800000000002s)]
*  In my mind it's not government fix it for us or customers you decide and then we'll [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1257.54s)]
*  move. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1261.92s)]
*  We are moving. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1263.0s)]
*  The 10 to 15 billion dollars we are spending, we're spending today. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1264.0s)]
*  If we're going to be able to scale it up to make it 20 30 40 billion dollars in years [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1270.0s)]
*  to come you will need these value pools to emerge pretty quickly and you will need the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1274.12s)]
*  uptake and you'll need the scalability. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1278.56s)]
*  And that is where I think progress will really start. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1281.8799999999999s)]
*  That's when you get the inflection point. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1284.44s)]
*  And I see in some areas that's happening maybe less so in other areas and in our energy transition [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1285.96s)]
*  strategy which we will report out in March will give a bit of a perspective of here's [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1291.62s)]
*  what we're seeing at the moment and here's how we're positioning for that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1296.76s)]
*  And are you going to go into more detail at that time about just how your low carbon energy [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1299.48s)]
*  segment is broken down and kind of your financials on that or. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1306.18s)]
*  No so the intent is really to elevate this to the two sectors you know so something like [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1312.1200000000001s)]
*  transport. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1317.1200000000001s)]
*  What is it that we see today is in the money when it comes to for example passenger vehicles [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1318.66s)]
*  or commercial transport or marine or aviation and what's the pathway to get to net zero [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1323.04s)]
*  by 2050. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1330.04s)]
*  So it but on the back of that therefore there are obvious investment choices capital investment [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  choices we need to make to be able to respond to those realities. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1336.5600000000002s)]
*  And so it hopefully will help our investors and others who are interested to just glean [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1340.4s)]
*  what a an energy company sees right now and what we think is the right balance today of [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1345.2s)]
*  security affordability and of course sustainability. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1351.8799999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about China and how you're seeing the trajectory of tensions and how you're [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1356.1999999999998s)]
*  factoring that into your business and also just the economic picture. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1363.04s)]
*  Look a couple of points I think one it's important to complement the incredible progress that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1369.76s)]
*  China has been making on the on the energy transition. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1377.6s)]
*  I continue to be blown away by the numbers in 2023 north of 50 percent of renewable [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1380.08s)]
*  deployment happened in China in the world. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1385.52s)]
*  With 50 percent and north of 50 percent of the 14 million electric vehicles that were [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1389.28s)]
*  sold were sold in China. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1394.1200000000001s)]
*  And so there's something around and this is why we are very curious and partnering in [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1398.72s)]
*  places like China for example in E.V. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1404.08s)]
*  We've just opened up a site recently over 270 E.V. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1406.9199999999998s)]
*  charging points. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1411.48s)]
*  My God I mean that's that's massive. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  And the utilization on that site is already healthy. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1415.4399999999998s)]
*  And so I'm optimistic from a climate perspective where China is going clearly the geopolitics [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1418.72s)]
*  is a concern. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1426.32s)]
*  We continue to watch that not just in terms of investment in China but we also look at [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1427.36s)]
*  in terms of supply chain from China and how we position ourselves there from an economic [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1432.8799999999999s)]
*  perspective. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1439.4399999999998s)]
*  At least my interpretation based on our energy sales in China is the picture isn't as bleak [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1441.8s)]
*  as I sometimes read in the papers. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1447.4799999999998s)]
*  I see steady growth maybe not as aggressive as one would have hoped for coming out of [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1449.1999999999998s)]
*  covid but in multiple sectors there are last year or through last year and into this year [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1455.0s)]
*  already there's good progress good energy utilization in a lot of areas. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1460.84s)]
*  There are some areas for example in the building sector or the buildings related sectors where [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1466.76s)]
*  you continue to see headwinds. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1470.1999999999998s)]
*  But by and large it seems to be a steady march towards an improvement. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  OK we'll go to questions in two minutes so just please please get ready with that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1478.56s)]
*  I want to ask you about oil and gas and production because just to stay flat with production [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1487.3999999999999s)]
*  you've got to invest a lot depleting assets right. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1494.32s)]
*  So you can't do that all with your existing heartlands like do you need do you need to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1497.76s)]
*  go do you need another do you need the elephants out there do you need are you elephant hunting [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  do you need new frontiers like where are you going to get these. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  Also now kind of pulling it back in some areas like Nigeria right. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1515.12s)]
*  So where where are you looking. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1519.04s)]
*  I do think our core heartlands today continue to be a fundamental source of our replenishment [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1524.32s)]
*  right. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1531.84s)]
*  And we have gone out also to the markets and been very clear that on the basis of our current [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1533.56s)]
*  portfolio we expect to have our liquids production flat up to 2030 right. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1539.36s)]
*  And that's before new expiration opportunities that's before other bolt on opportunities [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1545.32s)]
*  and so so it is not something that is that is short term a concern. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1550.4399999999998s)]
*  We have announced a number of opportunities we have north of five hundred thousand barrels [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1557.84s)]
*  per day of capacity coming on stream in this period up to 2025. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1561.84s)]
*  We'll have seen for example recent announcements like Sparta in the Gulf of Mexico or the recent [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1567.44s)]
*  startup of the mayor to field in Brazil and more. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1572.56s)]
*  And so those are massive massive geological provinces. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1577.72s)]
*  I mean Brazil the current reality is we will run out of license period before you will [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1582.52s)]
*  ever run out of resource in the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1588.8s)]
*  Our focus is very much how do we continue to actually leverage AI and other capabilities [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1592.76s)]
*  to be able to get hydrocarbons into our existing infrastructure one of the most efficient and [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1597.12s)]
*  carbon optimal ways to be able to to produce oil and gas. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1603.2399999999998s)]
*  So it's very much a focus on on core and we continue to still have a very vibrant expiration [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  program that is more and more shifting towards those core away from the frontiers and more [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1614.28s)]
*  and more towards the core where there still is a lot of opportunities to be able to run. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1619.4799999999998s)]
*  And then selectively we will continue to add to the portfolio. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1623.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm sure I hope there are questions out there. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1626.96s)]
*  I haven't asked about oil prices or commodity prices at all. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1629.44s)]
*  So go ahead. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1633.68s)]
*  I told Myers from AccuWeather when you talk about carbon neutral 2050 what about methane neutral? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1635.76s)]
*  Yeah I hope we can get methane neutral a lot sooner than that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1643.96s)]
*  So we have committed to be to get the near zero methane emissions by 2030. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1647.16s)]
*  I think it's absolutely critical. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1653.96s)]
*  So we are the largest player in LNG sales around the world. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1656.8400000000001s)]
*  Five six years ago we've tried to create a forum where we can get multiple players in to be able [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1664.3600000000001s)]
*  to start to share the toolkit of how do you actually manage methane. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1669.2s)]
*  It is not overly difficult and actually you can create a lot of value by capturing the machine the methane [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1673.04s)]
*  whether it's in shipping whether it's in the production or whether it's in the utilization. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1678.48s)]
*  We have a target of 0.2 percent not higher than 0.2 percent. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1683.6s)]
*  We are already today well below 0.1 percent and there's a very clear pathway. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1688.6799999999998s)]
*  And I was very encouraged by COP 28 where there was an undertaking with 52 companies producing around 40 percent [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1693.7199999999998s)]
*  of the world's oil and gas to commit to near zero methane emissions by 2030. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1702.08s)]
*  I think it'd be a I think it'd be a real shame if we're still talking about this post 2030. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1707.1999999999998s)]
*  And we are committed as a company. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1712.6399999999999s)]
*  This is absolutely front and center for us to be able to address. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1714.24s)]
*  I am Scott Wharton. I'm the CEO of a solar big new next gen solar panel based in Silicon Valley. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1720.84s)]
*  Arguably solar energy is now the lowest cost energy source in the world now. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1727.48s)]
*  How does that sit into your portfolio both today and in the future. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1731.36s)]
*  Yeah thanks Scott. I agree with you. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1735.32s)]
*  I mean was it last year 400 gigawatts of solar deployment around the world 80 percent of the overall renewables. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1737.28s)]
*  I agree with you. I think it's a it is the biggest space. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1743.8s)]
*  What we are focused on and we have a few solar players we have Savion that you might know in the US and we've acquired the platform in India as well. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1747.76s)]
*  Where we play is particularly in the integrated value chains. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1757.16s)]
*  We don't see ourselves as particularly differentiated in creating solar farms. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1760.08s)]
*  That's not the capability of Shell and I'm not sure we can do it cheaper than potentially you or others can. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1766.6000000000001s)]
*  So what we're focused on is more the value chain. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1772.8000000000002s)]
*  We have the customer interface and we have as Jenny earlier said the largest energy program or energy trading program in the world. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1774.88s)]
*  Our ability to be able to be your off taker of choice to be able to give you certainty to invest is what excites us. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1783.24s)]
*  Sometimes we'll take equity to be able to down to underwrite the project and move forward. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1789.96s)]
*  But for us solar is an exciting opportunity for now to deliver electrons. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1795.44s)]
*  What particularly excites me about the future because if you're really going to get to net zero by 2050 you're going to need to route through e fuels. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1800.88s)]
*  And that's where solar can play a fantastic role in the future. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1809.44s)]
*  Of course with battery storage and the like to talk to take those electrons and shift them into green molecules. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1812.2800000000002s)]
*  That's the step change in particular for the industrial sector. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1817.92s)]
*  Sorry my back to you. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  I can't sign make a turn this way. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1825.04s)]
*  Sid Wilson I'm the president and chief executive officer of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility in Washington D.C. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1827.0s)]
*  My question is actually at different angles about people. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  Can you give your insights on how do you create within Shell and maybe within the oil and gas industry a more inclusive environment in an industry that's historically a slow turnover industry compared to others. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1837.88s)]
*  And especially when you're thinking about this transformation into into different areas within energy. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1855.5600000000002s)]
*  What's your thoughts in terms of how to move the needle for those inclusive opportunities to create more D.I. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1861.52s)]
*  Look I think it has to be leader led and. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1870.28s)]
*  Me sitting in front of you today is a tribute to many other leaders who have significantly moved the needle on D.I. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1875.72s)]
*  When I joined in 1997 there were enough people who told me as somebody of Lebanese descent that I had no place actually in the company. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1885.68s)]
*  The privilege to be sitting as a non Anglo Dutch CEO of a company like Shell I think speaks volumes to the culture that my predecessors have built and which I have the responsibility to continue to drive. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1897.04s)]
*  And so I've chosen to make the focus on inclusion not a topic that others in the company sponsor but it's one that I directly sponsored. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1908.92s)]
*  That is more than just showing up and giving a few speeches every once in a while and waving my arms. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1919.28s)]
*  This is much more about. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1924.0s)]
*  Of course there's a diversity element to it but the biggest the biggest hope in my mind is how to create it to create the inclusion piece. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1926.8s)]
*  Where I do think the challenges we see as we navigate the energy transition are going to require fundamentally different mental models than we have had in the past. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1934.48s)]
*  And our ability to be able to get the best of the ninety two thousand people will absolutely require us to create that environment so it is engagement it is calling out when we screw up. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1943.52s)]
*  And being very honest about it and we've done that quite a few times but that's the way to be able to have that dialogue and to be honest when things are going well celebrate them and when they're not going well intervene and intervene with clarity of intent. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1954.6s)]
*  I don't expect this is something we'll ever be able to simply say we've achieved the end point here but it's one which I think is an incredibly important piece from a values perspective for us as a company and from a value perspective in terms of what we're trying to achieve. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1967.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1982.8s)]
*  So other question. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1984.36s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1986.1999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan Bass with Arjun Ellen G. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1987.1999999999998s)]
*  We're building 10 million tons per annum facility in Port Fuchon. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1989.52s)]
*  How do you see the venture global and the issues that have gone through the last year going forward in taking off take agreements with other projects that are coming online downstream. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=1994.28s)]
*  Firstly just to recognize how incredible Port Fuchon is. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2005.52s)]
*  I've had the privilege having been in New Orleans to visit it a number of times when I was looking after the Port business. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2009.04s)]
*  What what what you guys have done out there is really really impressive. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2014.92s)]
*  Look I think the Ellen G. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2019.6399999999999s)]
*  Business is one that is. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2021.36s)]
*  At the nexus of energy transition and energy at the nexus of energy security and energy sustainability. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2025.68s)]
*  It is one of the most exciting things to do right now is I think to be in the LNG space. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2035.08s)]
*  And there was no more stark of a reminder than the LNG that kept the lights on in Europe last year or in 2022 and partly last year and the LNG that continues to play a role in many many countries. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2040.84s)]
*  I've said this publicly before. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2053.68s)]
*  The biggest supply of LNG to the world 85 percent of the growth is coming from the US and from China and the second half of this US and Qatar in the second half of this decade. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2055.44s)]
*  My apologies. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2067.2s)]
*  The biggest thing that Qatar has focused on is reliability of supply and the the upholding of the contracts. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2069.7599999999998s)]
*  I do think some of the discussions that are ongoing right now and the disputes that are ongoing have an impact on the confidence in LNG coming out of the US. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2078.72s)]
*  It worries me as somebody who has a very keen interest in the LNG market and I do hope through the judicial undertakings that some solution will be found around it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2088.64s)]
*  But it's deeply worrying when of course I have a perspective I'm sure others will have different perspective. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2100.96s)]
*  It's deeply worrying when some of the basics that have built this industry the LNG industry has been built on the sanctity of contracts that that is being disputed in today's world. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2107.04s)]
*  And so I hope we can figure out a way through this for the industry and for for the world to be honest. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2116.48s)]
*  Just to clarify you're talking about the dispute with venture. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2123.72s)]
*  Venture. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2126.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2126.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2128.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2128.48s)]
*  Hi. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2129.12s)]
*  My name is Collins. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2129.88s)]
*  I'm from Nigeria and I run a consulting company called Less Consulting. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2131.3199999999997s)]
*  About six hours ago I know Shell has agreed to sell all of its onshore activities in Nigeria for about one point three billion dollars. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2136.96s)]
*  And you know it's been a long time coming. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2148.88s)]
*  Shell has been trying to leave the onshore activities of Nigeria. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2152.6s)]
*  Why leave the whole Niger Delta region. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2159.3199999999997s)]
*  Why haven't you been able to sort whatever the crisis was because I know it's not it's not something that you want to do. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2163.24s)]
*  But I think you release an asset by trying to sell off that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2173.56s)]
*  And you are also providing one point two billion to the buyers as well. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2177.24s)]
*  So what's the economic impact to Shell and how is that going to strengthen Nigeria's relationship with Shell. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2181.3199999999997s)]
*  You know looking at the way ExxonMobil is also always you know with the president of Nigeria you know trying to make sure that they have a great relationship with Nigeria and the ExxonMobil executives. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2188.32s)]
*  So I haven't seen in a long time Shell trying to solidify that relationship. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2202.7200000000003s)]
*  Otherwise what they keep doing is trying to sell their assets and move away you know entirely move away from the onshore business. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2208.4s)]
*  And what do you have to say to that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2215.44s)]
*  And thank you for the implication. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2218.88s)]
*  Yeah. Thank you for the question. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2221.08s)]
*  I think a few things to say. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2222.1200000000003s)]
*  Firstly our relationship with Nigeria is a long long standing relationship and one we covered. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2223.6800000000003s)]
*  So for avoidance of doubt what we are doing right now is focusing very much on our deep water business in Nigeria and focusing on our gas value chain through into LNG in Nigeria. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2231.28s)]
*  And that we are committed to and we're committed to actually continuing to invest and to grow those businesses. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  Those are at the core of what we have said as a company we're going to focus on. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2247.52s)]
*  We have said this is a while back we said that the risk return balance is no longer one that we can actually work in Nigeria on the onshore side. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2252.04s)]
*  We are very focused and your point around why are you financing the buyer. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2263.3199999999997s)]
*  It is our way of being able to make sure that we create a viable entity that continues to play a critical role in Nigeria's overall economy. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2269.2400000000002s)]
*  The quality of the people we have in our assets in our company and SPDC are you know the world's best. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2277.8s)]
*  After English and Dutch expatriates in Shell the third largest group is our Nigerian expatriates because that's where we build incredible capability. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2285.44s)]
*  So we want to make sure that we have invested in creating a sustained business that's going to run into the long term. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2293.52s)]
*  Our commitment is is very very strongly to our deep water and to our Nigerian LNG business gas value chain and we are very very close to many of the to the governmental officials as we try to navigate that portfolio alignment which we are going to do. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2299.36s)]
*  So I'm excited about the future that we're going with but also as always when you let go of an asset there is that emotion of letting go of an asset that has been part of our portfolio for 68 years. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw2t2xC_VeY&t=2314.88s)]
