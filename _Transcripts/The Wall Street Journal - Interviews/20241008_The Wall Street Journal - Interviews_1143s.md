# Dissecting How Chinese Hackers Breached Verizon, AT&T and Lumen | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro)
*  So I was struck when news of the Salt Typhoon story [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=0.0s)]
*  broke by my colleagues in the journal, description [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=5.48s)]
*  of the attack, and their view that it [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=11.32s)]
*  was potentially catastrophic. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=13.88s)]
*  In a world in which there are many, many cyber attacks [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=17.12s)]
*  and cyber breaches, that's pretty extreme language. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=20.56s)]
*  So what makes this particular episode so unusual? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=23.72s)]
*  So I think there are a couple of things that have come out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  already, and we should recognize that this is early days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=31.72s)]
*  And both the US government, the communications companies, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=34.96s)]
*  other parts of the cybersecurity community [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=41.36s)]
*  are just getting their arms around what exactly happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  But so far, we know that China, a likely part [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  of their intelligence apparatus, compromised [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=51.32s)]
*  multiple communications companies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  And according to the Wall Street Journal, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=56.32s)]
*  three of the biggest ones in the country, AT&T, Verizon, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=58.36s)]
*  and Lumen, were compromised for at the minimum months, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=60.68s)]
*  potentially longer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=64.16s)]
*  So again, deep access to the most critical communications [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=66.08s)]
*  companies in the country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=69.64s)]
*  And in part, they had access to the systems [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=72.28s)]
*  that controlled the way in which the US government requested [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=77.56s)]
*  lawful access under court-ordered warrants. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=80.92s)]
*  So again, if they have access to that type of information, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  they potentially have access to other critical and sensitive [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=87.16s)]
*  information on those networks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=89.8s)]
*  And so the idea of the scale of what they could do, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  the scale of the access, and their ability [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=95.32s)]
*  to remain undetected for months, to me, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=99.12s)]
*  is extremely significant and concerning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=102.08s)]
*  And I think that we'll likely learn more about how [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=104.56s)]
*  problematic this really was. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=108.52s)]
*  We hope we learn more. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=109.88s)]
*  So it begs the question, how did they do this? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=112.4s)]
*  Again, we don't know yet. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=115.92s)]
*  We don't know the way in which they've gotten in in this case. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=117.56s)]
*  But we can see that China has used a variety of tactics [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=121.0s)]
*  to compromise our most critical infrastructure in this country, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=125.16s)]
*  sometimes for intelligence gathering, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  sometimes to pre-position for future disruptive or destructive [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  attacks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=133.8s)]
*  Even just last year, a group associated with China [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=135.04s)]
*  with the name Storm 558 compromised Microsoft in such [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=139.64s)]
*  a way that they had the signing keys for basically all [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=143.84s)]
*  of Microsoft Exchange online, the ability [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=146.88s)]
*  to read emails from anyone that they chose to. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=150.08s)]
*  So they have demonstrated repeatedly an ability [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=154.0s)]
*  to get into our hardened networks [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=156.52s)]
*  from our most critical companies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=158.4s)]
*  What is the access route? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=160.24s)]
*  And what does the edge have to do with that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=161.84s)]
*  Yeah, so again, it's going to be different in each context. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=164.04s)]
*  In the case of the Storm 558 compromise at Microsoft, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=166.96s)]
*  we still today don't know the initial intrusion [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=169.72s)]
*  vector into that attack. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=172.68s)]
*  But in other cases, particularly in their pre-positioning [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  on US critical infrastructure, think [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=179.24s)]
*  power companies, water companies, transportation, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  oil and gas, the vast majority of cases [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=184.36s)]
*  were compromised through vulnerable edge devices. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=188.28s)]
*  What do vulnerable edge devices include? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=192.32s)]
*  They could be routers, mail gateways, VPNs, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=194.84s)]
*  often have very privileged access onto your network. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  They are notoriously bad at things like logging. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=204.08s)]
*  And they are riddled historically [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  with vulnerabilities. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=210.6s)]
*  Repeatedly, you're seeing cases where. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=211.6s)]
*  Is it fair to say that in many cases, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=214.52s)]
*  these are unmanaged devices, devices that sort of exist [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=216.72s)]
*  without a formal management structure? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=220.12s)]
*  I mean, they are managed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  But the way in which they are structured [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  tends to give them a lot of access. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  And unless you yourself are putting a lot of protections [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=228.64s)]
*  around them, it has proven difficult out of the box. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  For example, you can't do the same kind of forensic analysis [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=235.0s)]
*  on those devices that you can do to others. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=237.72s)]
*  You have to send them back to the manufacturer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=239.44s)]
*  to have them decrypted to give you better insight [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=241.64s)]
*  in what's happening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=243.88s)]
*  And so it puts a lot more burden on the enterprise IT [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=245.0s)]
*  management and the security apparatus. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Burden on the enterprise, that's the bottom line. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  100%. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=253.88s)]
*  I mean, again, these devices, because of the nature [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=254.68s)]
*  of their vulnerabilities, because of the way they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=258.6s)]
*  operated and configured, it puts a lot of burden [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=260.72s)]
*  on the users, in this case, the corporate IT departments [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=263.96s)]
*  and corporate CISO offices, to put in place security that's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  not there out of the box. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=271.68s)]
*  So I think one of the most interesting aspects [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=273.36s)]
*  of this story is this discussion of the extent to which routers, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  Cisco routers, may have been compromised. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=281.12s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that scenario? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=283.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, according to the Washington Post, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=287.0s)]
*  yesterday when writing about this, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=289.36s)]
*  they indicated that the Chinese actors had reconfigured Cisco [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=290.76s)]
*  routers to enable exfiltration of information [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=295.68s)]
*  from these wiretap systems, which both their ability [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=298.52s)]
*  to do that in production environments, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=302.52s)]
*  their ability to do that without detection for months, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=304.92s)]
*  demonstrates to me both a really significant set [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=307.36s)]
*  of capabilities that they were operating on, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=312.28s)]
*  that they knew how to configure those. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=315.55999999999995s)]
*  And that they were able to do without detection. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Without going too deep into the tech weeds, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=318.32s)]
*  what does it mean to be able to remotely and in a secret manner [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=320.4s)]
*  reconfigure a Cisco router or someone else's router? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=327.55999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it requires a real deep understanding [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=331.0s)]
*  of how that network is operating to be [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=335.0s)]
*  able to understand how to give commands to that router [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=337.2s)]
*  to begin to change without affecting the visibility [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=340.16s)]
*  for the operators to understand that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  It requires their ability to operate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  in parts of that network so they can move data in and out, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=348.76000000000005s)]
*  particularly out in this case, without detection. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think, again, we're still at the early stages of this. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=356.24s)]
*  And I think, particularly with these kind of tactics [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=360.36s)]
*  where they were able to use the operator's own equipment [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  against them is concerning. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=366.8s)]
*  So given what we know, we think we know, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=368.56s)]
*  what you know about the situation, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=372.16s)]
*  what are the takeaways so far for the enterprise? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=375.64s)]
*  Yeah, and again, a lot of these takeaways [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=379.92s)]
*  go back to what the US government has been saying [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=381.72s)]
*  for a while when it comes to China [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  because of the improved both tactics and capabilities [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=386.24s)]
*  that they're employing, particularly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=389.64s)]
*  using native administrative applications on networks [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=392.52s)]
*  against the networks itself. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=395.6s)]
*  One, it requires operators to have much greater, deeper [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=398.48s)]
*  visibility into what's happening on their network [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  so they can establish what is a normal baseline [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  and when things are happening outside of that baseline. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=406.04s)]
*  Second, I think, as we talked about earlier, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=409.56s)]
*  protecting your edge in an environment where network [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=411.92s)]
*  boundaries are less clear. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=415.68s)]
*  You've got hybrid cloud, on-prem environments, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  your ability to understand where your edge is, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  what kind of devices are operating on that edge, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=422.68s)]
*  what kind of trust and authentication [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=424.76s)]
*  they have into your network, and your ability [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=426.76s)]
*  to secure them is critical. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=428.4s)]
*  And third, and probably most important, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  given the Chinese ability to continue to compromise networks, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=432.96s)]
*  is the ability to build in operational resilience [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=438.08s)]
*  into your systems. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=441.08s)]
*  Can you operate in a degraded or disrupted state? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=441.96s)]
*  And I think, as was mentioned earlier on this stage, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  the CrowdStrike outage was a good demonstration [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=450.28s)]
*  of what China would like to do to us on a bad day [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=453.52s)]
*  in the eve of conflict. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=457.28s)]
*  And we need to be prepared for disruptions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=459.11999999999995s)]
*  to critical IT systems across the country, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  and can we continue to operate? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=465.2s)]
*  I think the CrowdStrike outage says no. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=466.96s)]
*  We should talk a lot more about that scenario in a moment, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=468.67999999999995s)]
*  but I just wanted to see if we can recap. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  Those three things for the enterprise are, one, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  focus on the edge, two, resilience, and then three, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  or in this case, number one. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=483.56s)]
*  Was the improved visibility for baseline operations, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=487.68s)]
*  particularly for administrative applications [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=490.16s)]
*  by your network. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=492.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=493.16s)]
*  OK, what role does AI play in all of these tasks? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=493.72s)]
*  So I think that there are places where [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=499.56s)]
*  AI can improve a company's operations. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=501.96s)]
*  I would argue that today a lot of companies [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=506.92s)]
*  are coming out with cyber-enabled AI systems, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=510.14s)]
*  arguably faster than adversaries or weaponizing AI. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=513.8199999999999s)]
*  But the challenge is, I don't think [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  that we have yet seen the best implementations of AI [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=520.22s)]
*  for real cybersecurity. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  I think that there are still a ways [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=526.5s)]
*  to go in terms of development and implementation. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=528.3s)]
*  A company we're at now, SentinelOne, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=531.74s)]
*  has one that I think is important for helping SOCs [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=533.34s)]
*  be able to improve their ability to integrate data [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=537.18s)]
*  from a variety of different cybersecurity sources, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=539.22s)]
*  including ones outside of ours. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  But there is a lot more work to do on AI. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  It is not a panacea in this case. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=547.22s)]
*  The types of solutions that need to be engineered [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=549.82s)]
*  into networks are still going to require people to do [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  some hard work to understand how they architect their networks [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=555.12s)]
*  in a more secure fashion, how they build in protections where [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=557.86s)]
*  they're lacking, how they give themselves [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=560.82s)]
*  the right level of visibility. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=562.74s)]
*  AI can certainly help with some of those, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=564.38s)]
*  but it doesn't replace it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=567.94s)]
*  It doesn't fix the problem. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=568.82s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=570.46s)]
*  Just one more question on those three areas [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=572.5400000000001s)]
*  where the enterprise needs to drill down. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=574.82s)]
*  Where do you think the greatest vulnerabilities are? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=577.38s)]
*  If you look at companies across the spectrum, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=580.3000000000001s)]
*  where do they tend to be weakest or need the most work? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  I think you're going to see companies [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=589.62s)]
*  be weak across all three of those areas that I mentioned. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=591.7800000000001s)]
*  But I will continue to hit on the vulnerable edge, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=594.98s)]
*  because we have seen that the exploitive choice for both [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  nation states and ransomware groups repeatedly [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=603.1s)]
*  over the past several years. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=605.9000000000001s)]
*  And I would say since the pandemic has moved [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  the workforce more remote, since the edge has gotten fuzzier [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=609.3800000000001s)]
*  with the way networks are architected today, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  we have seen almost every major cybersecurity campaign launched [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=616.82s)]
*  by an adversary, again, nation state or criminal, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=621.5s)]
*  at some point is going to exploit [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=624.26s)]
*  those vulnerable edge devices. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=625.7s)]
*  And if there is one place to focus in the short term, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=627.26s)]
*  it's there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=629.98s)]
*  So how do you think companies should think about risk [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=631.02s)]
*  more broadly, especially when it comes to China? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=633.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I spent some time in late 2021, early 2022 [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  working with companies both before and after [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=643.1s)]
*  the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=646.66s)]
*  And the one comment that a lot of them [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=649.06s)]
*  made is, particularly ones who had operations in Russia [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=651.78s)]
*  or had some dependence on Russia, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=655.4599999999999s)]
*  that they were scrambling to figure out what to do, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=657.14s)]
*  how to get out of Russia. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=660.78s)]
*  I would argue that companies today, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=662.98s)]
*  if you're not already thinking about what you would do [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=665.66s)]
*  the day after a crisis erupts over Taiwan, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=668.14s)]
*  you're probably late, because our business relationships, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  our technology dependence with China [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=676.22s)]
*  dwarfs what it was for Russia prior to the invasion. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=679.22s)]
*  So thinking about your risk profile [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=682.38s)]
*  when it comes to China, thinking about your dependence [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=684.1s)]
*  and your supply chain interactions with China, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=687.98s)]
*  how do you secure your network that may have touch points [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=690.9s)]
*  there, particularly given the aggressive move [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=694.34s)]
*  by Chinese authorities to ask for encryption [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=696.82s)]
*  keys and source code on software for companies operating [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=699.0600000000001s)]
*  in China. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  You need to be thinking about your risk profile today. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=703.58s)]
*  What else can the government, or should the government do? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=706.62s)]
*  It already has restrictions on the import and the export [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=708.82s)]
*  of hardware and software to and from China. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=713.1400000000001s)]
*  Do those policies go far enough? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=715.9000000000001s)]
*  Those are delaying tactics. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=718.7s)]
*  They are designed to slow, not stop [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=720.94s)]
*  China's development of more advanced computers, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=723.7800000000001s)]
*  more advanced technology, more advanced tools. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=727.3000000000001s)]
*  They're working. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=730.1400000000001s)]
*  But China is working very hard to counteract them. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=731.38s)]
*  They have got aggressive efforts to develop things homegrown. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=733.58s)]
*  And the US is going to have to stay on top of that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=738.02s)]
*  if they hope to continue to contain China's technological [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=740.06s)]
*  advancements they plan on using for both civilian [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=743.18s)]
*  and military applications. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=746.74s)]
*  I don't think that that stops China from getting [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=749.14s)]
*  where they want to be. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  It may just affect the timeline for getting there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=753.14s)]
*  What do you think that these attacks tell us [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=755.66s)]
*  about the potential for military confrontation between China [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=757.78s)]
*  and Taiwan, China and the US, China, and any other country? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=762.38s)]
*  So this operation against communications companies [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=765.98s)]
*  is largely, we believe, from looking at it [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=770.22s)]
*  from the outside, an intelligence gathering operation [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=773.78s)]
*  something that they've done for a long time. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  They just have done, have just scored a major success [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=777.9s)]
*  getting our biggest communications companies. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  That being said, and US officials [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=783.34s)]
*  have talked about this publicly, Xi [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=785.58s)]
*  has given direction to the PLA to be prepared militarily [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=788.22s)]
*  to retake Taiwan in 2027. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=791.14s)]
*  Whether they get there, whether they are ready, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=793.62s)]
*  and whether he believes the generals when they tell him [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=795.82s)]
*  that they're ready is an open question. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=799.2600000000001s)]
*  But they're operating on a 2027 timeline to be ready. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=801.86s)]
*  And that means, on our end, we need [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=805.62s)]
*  to be equally prepared, both inside the United States, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=807.94s)]
*  but as well as with our partners and allies in Asia that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  may be confronted with that type of crisis. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  So time is not on our side. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=816.86s)]
*  And we need to be doing everything we can to be as ready [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=818.98s)]
*  as possible. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=821.82s)]
*  And it's why, when I talked about companies [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=822.46s)]
*  need to be cited in the fact that they [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=824.58s)]
*  need to understand their risk posture when it comes to China, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=826.0600000000001s)]
*  that there is no time to wait. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=829.7800000000001s)]
*  I want to follow up on what exactly being more ready [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=831.34s)]
*  entails. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=834.62s)]
*  But I also want to just see if there [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=835.14s)]
*  are any questions from the audience. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=837.7s)]
*  If you do, yes, please. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=840.22s)]
*  Tim. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=842.94s)]
*  Hi, Tim. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=846.62s)]
*  Hello? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=848.1s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=848.62s)]
*  Tim Crawford with MOA. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=849.38s)]
*  So what is to prevent? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=854.9s)]
*  We'll switch to the one that works. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=855.42s)]
*  Tim Crawford with the VOA. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=856.98s)]
*  So my question is, it's one thing [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=858.3s)]
*  when we start talking about activities that are coming [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=861.1s)]
*  from offshore to the US. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=864.02s)]
*  But what's to prevent things from actually [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=867.86s)]
*  germinating within the borders of the US, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=870.66s)]
*  even if it is funded by nation states? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=874.42s)]
*  We talk about maybe more, in other ways, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=877.06s)]
*  we talk about sleeper cells. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=881.86s)]
*  But you could potentially have the same kind of situation [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=884.14s)]
*  taking place within some of these high performance [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=887.3s)]
*  computing environments that now have access to networks [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=890.38s)]
*  and activities that you have that kind of natural boundary [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=895.06s)]
*  if they're coming from overseas. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=900.1s)]
*  So a couple of points. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=901.66s)]
*  One, most attacks against our critical infrastructure, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=903.4599999999999s)]
*  including from the Chinese government, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=907.62s)]
*  may originate overseas. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=910.5799999999999s)]
*  But they're going to be operating [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  through our own infrastructure. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=913.14s)]
*  So if we look at some of the operations [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=914.54s)]
*  that the US government has taken to disrupt Chinese net [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=916.14s)]
*  obfuscation networks, those are largely [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=919.38s)]
*  taking down US small and home office routers [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=921.74s)]
*  that are being used to actually attack [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=924.78s)]
*  the US critical infrastructure. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=926.9399999999999s)]
*  They're just the path that the Chinese go through. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=928.54s)]
*  Second, the insider threat picture is equally concerning. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=930.9399999999999s)]
*  I think you've seen more recently cases [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=936.98s)]
*  in this case not China, but more often not North Korean, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=940.46s)]
*  putting IT workers to be hired by US companies who [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=944.02s)]
*  give them privileged access inside of these. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=948.34s)]
*  Or in some cases, they'll be masquerading [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=951.14s)]
*  as an employee from a third country, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=953.5400000000001s)]
*  but they're really going to be a North Korean IT worker. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=955.34s)]
*  So that is real. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=957.62s)]
*  And US companies right now today are dealing with that. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=958.62s)]
*  But they are hiring workers that they think [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=961.4200000000001s)]
*  pass the Clean Bill of Health, but they're actually [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=963.1800000000001s)]
*  North Korean government cybersecurity workers who [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=965.34s)]
*  are both maybe doing some work on the side, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=968.9s)]
*  but more importantly, they're using their access [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=971.3s)]
*  to get hard currency for the country. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=973.66s)]
*  I want to go to one more question. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=977.5s)]
*  I believe there's one more question in the back. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=979.14s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=982.14s)]
*  Great, thank you. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=984.4599999999999s)]
*  Sabina Ewing Abbott. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=985.18s)]
*  So given that I think the FBI states it at 100 to 1 [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=986.9s)]
*  when we look at the competition of the coverage in China, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=991.86s)]
*  they could put 10 million people on this, you name it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=996.06s)]
*  How, from your government experience, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=999.8599999999999s)]
*  and now at Sentinel-1, is the cyber tech [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1002.54s)]
*  advocating for more of a Truman Doctrine type approach [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1006.6999999999999s)]
*  to how we go after nation state engagement? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1010.3399999999999s)]
*  Because I don't know about anybody else in the room, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1014.38s)]
*  but when I think about my cyber workforce, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1016.8599999999999s)]
*  I don't have a million people to put against it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1020.2199999999999s)]
*  And if a tank, I often say if a tank rolled up [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1023.2199999999999s)]
*  to the headquarters of Abbott, I [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1025.82s)]
*  would be expecting, in a kinetic situation, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1029.54s)]
*  the US government to respond, whereas right now I [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1032.26s)]
*  have to have a anti-tank missile in the equivalency for cyber. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1034.78s)]
*  So I'm just curious how you all are thinking about that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1040.3799999999999s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1042.62s)]
*  And I like to say that in the next conflict, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1043.78s)]
*  the private sector is not on the front line. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1047.62s)]
*  It is the front line. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1049.3799999999999s)]
*  That is the fact in cyber. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1050.9399999999998s)]
*  The things they're going to go after are the private sector. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1052.3799999999999s)]
*  That's what we're seeing today. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1054.98s)]
*  It is also true that we are never [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1056.94s)]
*  going to match China for total capacity, given what they [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1058.42s)]
*  are throwing at these problems. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1062.18s)]
*  They have the ability to walk and shoot them [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1063.54s)]
*  at the same time, to continue to expand their intelligence [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1065.34s)]
*  gathering at the same time that they're expanding their ability [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1067.84s)]
*  to target networks for future attack and disruption. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1070.7s)]
*  I think what separates us from them [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1073.8600000000001s)]
*  is innovation that's happening here, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1075.58s)]
*  and the vibrancy of our private sector community. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1079.18s)]
*  They don't have the same type of vibrant private sector [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1081.82s)]
*  cybersecurity community that we do. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1084.1s)]
*  And oftentimes, that's going to be [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1087.58s)]
*  the difference between success or failure to us. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1089.06s)]
*  And if we're able to continue to innovate and look for ways [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1092.1s)]
*  to scale our solutions across our entire country, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1095.26s)]
*  that's the way in which we're going to compete with China when [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  it comes to cyber. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1102.54s)]
*  Being smarter, focusing on what matters, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1103.78s)]
*  being ruthless about prioritization, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1106.2199999999998s)]
*  and ultimately working between government and industry [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1107.84s)]
*  to use all the innovation we can to protect [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1109.9599999999998s)]
*  our most critical systems. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1112.26s)]
*  It is going to require that type of cooperation. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1113.82s)]
*  No company should expect operate on their own [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1115.98s)]
*  against the nation state, but a lot of the burden [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1118.62s)]
*  is going to be on you. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1120.6599999999999s)]
*  And the government should be there to help and assist [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1122.1799999999998s)]
*  where it can. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1124.3s)]
*  It can do things that the private sector can't, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1125.34s)]
*  like disrupting operations overseas, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1127.26s)]
*  disrupting their operational infrastructure, making it [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1129.28s)]
*  harder for them to operate. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1131.58s)]
*  But ultimately, working together with industry, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1133.02s)]
*  I think, is our best hope of meeting the challenge [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1135.78s)]
*  that we face ahead of us. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoDnRd3-ro&t=1139.02s)]
