# BetMGM CEO on the State of Sports Betting, Super Bowl Advertising and More | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4)
*  We're starting off the morning and I wanted to get a level set with you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously, the journal's been writing quite extensively the last couple of weeks about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=4.88s)]
*  a little bit of a change that we're hearing from a couple of companies in terms of economic [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=8.44s)]
*  outlook. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=12.4s)]
*  Specifically, in the consumer products market, they're suggesting that there's a slowdown [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=13.4s)]
*  happening on consumer sentiment and spending. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, gambling seems to me like it's recession proof, but what are you seeing from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=23.04s)]
*  your business in terms of how people are feeling about their dollars? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=26.96s)]
*  For me, recession proof. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=32.92s)]
*  I use proof sparingly. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=34.4s)]
*  When I dropped my phone in the water and it was supposed to be waterproof and it wasn't, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  it was water resistant. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=41.44s)]
*  So I think our industry is recession resistant rather than proof. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=43.16s)]
*  But to answer your question specifically, it is generally less cyclical than the general [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=48.56s)]
*  economy, gambling as a category. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=53.96s)]
*  We are not seeing any impact of consumer slowdown at the moment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Our product really is an egalitarian product. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=61.8s)]
*  If I choose to wager at $10 stake, that's my comfort level or $1,000 stake. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=65.56s)]
*  Ultimately, it's the same core product. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=71.6s)]
*  I choose my stake according to my means and my desire. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=74.04s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  But have you seen any of the average betting size decrease at all? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  The average bet size has been very constant. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=82.76s)]
*  The other metric which might be an indicator is frequency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  We're not seeing any slowdown in frequency. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=92.04s)]
*  Bet size is consistent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  Session time, session frequency is consistent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=95.36s)]
*  We're buying less lipstick, but definitely betting way more. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Sounds good to me, anyway. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=104.92s)]
*  I wanted to talk a little bit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=106.12s)]
*  Obviously, your industry has been quite in the headlines in the last couple of weeks. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=107.68s)]
*  We've seen numerous betting scandals involving professional athletes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=112.0s)]
*  The latest one, LA Dodgers, O'Conny. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=117.12s)]
*  It's obviously causing quite a real title shift in terms of public opinion with consumers [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=120.2s)]
*  and legislatures and lawmakers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=126.74s)]
*  How do you view this and what's your response to this heat that's really putting pressure [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=129.44s)]
*  on all your companies? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=133.52s)]
*  I see this as an opportunity for our sector, to be honest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=135.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=140.12s)]
*  Because the starting point has to be, does it exist? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=141.4s)]
*  Do we have a grown-up perspective on this activity? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Does it exist in all circumstances? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=149.28s)]
*  All you have to do is look at the search volume around the Super Bowl for some of the illegal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=151.68s)]
*  operators and you'll see that there is still a lot of participation in the illegal market. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=156.84s)]
*  When we see these types of incidents, the argument for regulated sports betting and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=163.52s)]
*  I-gaming couldn't be stronger. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=170.3s)]
*  Total transparency. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  We know exactly where every player is at every wager. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  We know what their bet size is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=178.34s)]
*  We know who's been betting before them and after them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  We understand all of their linked devices and related accounts and we have a positive [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=182.74s)]
*  obligation to our regulators to report any, bless you, any nefarious activity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=187.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=192.74s)]
*  But regardless of, you know, you can all as the industry point to, well, that's the illegal [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=193.74s)]
*  stuff and we're the good guys, they're the bad guys. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  And regardless of that, in the minds of consumers, perception is just perception. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=201.14s)]
*  They don't actually distinguish between, a lot of times, between the legal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=204.38s)]
*  So how, you still get painted with that brush. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=207.6s)]
*  So how do you change that perception? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=210.42s)]
*  That's our opportunity. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  With heat comes pressure and with pressure comes change. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's that change that we need to harness in favor of regulation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=219.86s)]
*  Because of all the positive. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=225.12s)]
*  What is in all of our interests, no more scandals. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=227.94s)]
*  Protect the underage. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=232.26s)]
*  Protect the vulnerable. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=233.42s)]
*  So do we need more regulation in the sector? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=234.42s)]
*  I think we need blanket regulation, all states to ensure, and we need to have positive enforcement [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=236.7s)]
*  against their illegal operators. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=242.5s)]
*  And that's both regulator and lawmaker, as well as the media companies. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=244.62s)]
*  There are examples in other countries in the world where the payment processing is restricted, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=249.38s)]
*  media access is restricted, and narrowed to only legal operators. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=254.94s)]
*  But regulation on both sides, legal and even the legal side. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  More regulation for both illegal to crack down on the illegal, but also more regulation [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=264.3s)]
*  to make sure that those that are doing it legally are doing it the right way. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=269.3s)]
*  We do it the right way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=272.76s)]
*  Those who are doing it in the legal market, the degree, this is I think a common misunderstanding. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=275.76s)]
*  The degree of oversight and the intensity of the relationship with our regulator is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  woefully misunderstood. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=287.82s)]
*  We have extremely close, extremely positive relationships with all of our 29, 29 regulators. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=289.86s)]
*  I've got 80 people in my compliance group who do this every single day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=297.42s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=301.18s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=302.18s)]
*  When you think about these sort of crises and scandals, right, obviously it's a PR headwind [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=303.18s)]
*  for you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  But at the same time, you're ramping up your marketing and spending in really high profile [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=310.06s)]
*  places. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=314.94s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=316.06s)]
*  Does that make you a bigger target for the critics? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=317.06s)]
*  And how do you weigh that when you are putting so much money into it? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  Is that something you have to balance? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=322.62s)]
*  The opportunity for us is to engage in the substance rather than the clickbait headlines. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  I would love to have an opportunity to discuss all the work we are doing in responsible gambling. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=335.02s)]
*  The new organization which we've established with some of the leading operators in this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=342.14s)]
*  space focused on how we operate in a responsible manner, in a coordinated manner. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  So things like universal self-exclusion. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=357.02s)]
*  Things like the work we are doing in player education. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=361.46s)]
*  Our deep partnership with the industry leading program called Game Sense informing, educating [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=365.38s)]
*  our players, assisting those who have problems. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=374.46s)]
*  And there are at the margin, at the edge, there are players who need help and support [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  and we have an active program we invest actively in helping them on their rehabilitation journey. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=382.82s)]
*  So that's that trade group you guys established. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=388.58s)]
*  And how much money is being put towards that? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=390.54s)]
*  It's over $20 million for the first year. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=393.02s)]
*  For each company? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=395.02s)]
*  As a collective, the collective investment in the establishment of the group is over [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=396.66s)]
*  $20 million. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=400.34s)]
*  So all six of you or eight of you are putting in combined $20 million. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=401.34s)]
*  Is that enough money? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=406.14s)]
*  I mean there's a billion dollars spent to promote these. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=407.14s)]
*  Shouldn't it be a little bit more of a percentage or is that just table stakes at this point? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=410.5s)]
*  I think this is one of those where it's a ready fire aim situation. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=416.78s)]
*  Start, show positive intent, show substantial progress and then recalibrate according to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=420.82s)]
*  the market demand. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=428.18s)]
*  If more money is needed? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=429.74s)]
*  If more money is needed, we invest accordingly. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=430.97999999999996s)]
*  I want to switch topics because clearly the journal did, I did a story and spent a lot [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=434.41999999999996s)]
*  of time with your executives during Super Bowl and I've done this for a really long [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  time but it was quite interesting to see a new company come along and decide to go as [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=443.22s)]
*  big as you did in that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=448.94s)]
*  Obviously the headline was a $50 million Super Bowl campaign which even for me was like wow [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=451.06s)]
*  that's a lot of money. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  I'd love to get your thoughts on it from a CEO perspective. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  Because I know that headline wasn't one that made everybody, Neil, shneez shake a little [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=460.06s)]
*  bit. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=463.98s)]
*  How did it go? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=464.98s)]
*  What did you see in terms of your business? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=465.98s)]
*  So campaigns, delighted overall, campaigns I think as this group will know better than [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=468.46s)]
*  any, you never hit every one of your KPIs. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=475.85999999999996s)]
*  Overall what we saw was increased awareness of the brand. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=480.78s)]
*  We saw elevated player acquisition. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=485.0s)]
*  The number of first time depositors around the Super Bowl period was up 72%. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=488.46s)]
*  We had much more female participation. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=493.62s)]
*  I don't know whether that's because Tom Brady is as gorgeous as he is but I don't. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=496.26s)]
*  Could have been Vince Vaughan, who knows. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=500.65999999999997s)]
*  You know Vince is a, I love Vince. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=504.26s)]
*  So I think overall we were very pleased with how the brand represented itself. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=508.5s)]
*  The message associated with the brand was important for us as a, the key message was [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=512.8s)]
*  everybody apart from Tom Brady, he's one enough. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=522.22s)]
*  And where our natural lean up to this point was, BedMGM is more sophisticated, BedMGM [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=527.86s)]
*  leans a little bit older. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=536.02s)]
*  What we wanted to come away from that campaign with was a recognition that this isn't an [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=537.9s)]
*  exclusive club. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=544.1s)]
*  It's an aspirational club but it's not an exclusive club. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=545.6s)]
*  What KPIs didn't hit? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=549.86s)]
*  Where did it fall short? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=551.46s)]
*  So I saw not enough, I was expecting more first time depositors in Vegas itself, in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=553.38s)]
*  Nevada itself. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=560.22s)]
*  And one of the things that we underestimated frankly is the friction of signing up. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=561.94s)]
*  In order to sign up to a digital account in Nevada, you actually have to go and present [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=566.94s)]
*  yourself in a sports book and show your ID, sign some tax forms. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=570.74s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine people going down to Super Bowl in Vegas, sitting online and filling [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=576.6s)]
*  out paperwork with a cocktail in their hands. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=581.0s)]
*  So I don't blame you for that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=582.96s)]
*  Any other sort of challenges along the way? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  And did you grow market share? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  Because clearly you're number three and I would say a trailing number three for the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=588.84s)]
*  two kahunas in there. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=591.84s)]
*  And I know it's early to sort of see the full analysis but have you seen upticks in market [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=592.84s)]
*  share in certain markets? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=597.84s)]
*  So we have seen upticks in market share in certain markets. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=599.4s)]
*  Our industry and our business is a cohort churn model, cohort building churn model. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  And so our market share this month will be as a result of the work that we did over the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=612.28s)]
*  last 12 months. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=619.52s)]
*  So we can expect the work that we've done now in the first quarter to have a progressive [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=621.52s)]
*  and growing impact on the performance later in the year. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  So what we do is we look at top of funnel KPIs, acquisition KPIs, advancing positive [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=630.68s)]
*  signals, then the work becomes retention monetization. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  And so that's the work of the next few months. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=641.56s)]
*  Would you do it again? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  Would I do it again? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=645.92s)]
*  That's a question that we're discussing at the moment. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=646.92s)]
*  Well, who is, I'm trying to think who has Super Bowl next year. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they're already on your phone. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  Talk a little bit about, one of the things I found interesting about this story was because [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  you were sort of supercharging your ad spending, spending so much money, your marketing department [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=659.66s)]
*  had to go before the board to convince them and to you twice. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=664.06s)]
*  Because obviously I think the quote was something like when it comes to both like a wedding, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=668.14s)]
*  anytime you buy something, the prices go up, which was phenomenal. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=672.18s)]
*  Like totally that is Super Bowl. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=675.28s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=677.06s)]
*  What did they say to you that convinced you to move forward with this? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=678.06s)]
*  Because as a marketer, I can't imagine having to like go to the board to like, hey, I'm [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=681.38s)]
*  going to spend 50 million in a couple of weeks on Super Bowl. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=685.3s)]
*  What was that like and how they convinced you? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=687.76s)]
*  There's a degree of data and there's a degree of ambition. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  And we are at a point in our journey where frankly because of the total, the marketing [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=697.08s)]
*  dollars as a total, this represented an investment within a tolerance. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=704.3s)]
*  So if you divide the 50 into things you can measure and things you need to believe, the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=712.02s)]
*  risk in the things you need to believe relative to our total marketing budget was at a manageable [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=721.76s)]
*  scale. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=726.86s)]
*  What percentage of your marketing budget did it cover? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=727.86s)]
*  No, I can't tell you. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=729.34s)]
*  No, I knew you would go there. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=730.34s)]
*  Try and try and. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=733.34s)]
*  It's a hell of a lot. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=734.34s)]
*  That's all I know because I can't get away from there everywhere. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=735.34s)]
*  You guys are like between if it's not your ads, it's your competitors. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=737.9s)]
*  It's crazy how much advertising. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=741.0999999999999s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit because obviously you talked about market share. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=742.42s)]
*  You definitely are that distant third, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=746.78s)]
*  And you have the two kahunas ahead of you. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=749.06s)]
*  How do you catch up? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=751.92s)]
*  Given that they were early to this, they seem to have their apps are a little faster, right? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=753.4599999999999s)]
*  You guys are working to make sure that your app is actually the same sort of speed and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=758.02s)]
*  has all the bells and whistles. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=763.18s)]
*  How do you catch up? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=765.0999999999999s)]
*  Is it just about a marketing war at this point or what's what's how do you go about that? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=766.5s)]
*  So in the fourth quarter, but MGM had 14% aggregate market share in sports and gaming [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=771.82s)]
*  in the US and 22% in Canada. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=778.46s)]
*  The objectives for we win our 2024 plan, the big three head pillars of the plan are. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=783.1400000000001s)]
*  Continue our journey in product. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=793.82s)]
*  We can equate our investment in acquisition and retention marketing and unlock the power [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=797.74s)]
*  of Omni Channel in the van. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=801.46s)]
*  It's one of our in one of bed MGM superpowers or differentiators. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=803.38s)]
*  You know, MGM results has over 40,000 rooms, 13 million room nights in Nevada. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=808.1s)]
*  And within the within the results of an MGM property, we have a different relationship. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  We have a less noisy relationship with our players. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=824.4599999999999s)]
*  We don't have the other brand screaming for attention. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=828.66s)]
*  And so we are really looking to unlocking that Nevada experience for all of those MGM [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=831.86s)]
*  resorts, guests and visitors for the benefit of bed MGM. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=840.02s)]
*  And we unlock that through technology through a great app experience. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=843.74s)]
*  Isla's, which is one of the industry analysts, has said that the bed MGM app is the leading [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=847.5799999999999s)]
*  app in Nevada. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=852.2199999999999s)]
*  Bar none. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=854.0999999999999s)]
*  We have made tremendous progress in the last six months. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=855.78s)]
*  Our the time to log in has improved by something like 50%. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=858.8199999999999s)]
*  So from a product perspective, we're making tremendous progress. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=865.7399999999999s)]
*  We also acquired a business, a sports pricing business called Angstrom. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=869.9s)]
*  One of our shareholders acquired Angstrom last year. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=875.02s)]
*  And in fact, we've just now, last couple of weeks, we've enabled Angstrom to power a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=878.78s)]
*  product type called a same game parlay. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  So multiple selections within within the same event powered by this Angstrom business. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=888.06s)]
*  Why is it important? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=893.9799999999999s)]
*  Because parlay is where all the money is. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=894.9799999999999s)]
*  Parlay is where the margin is. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=896.9799999999999s)]
*  Margin. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=897.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=898.9799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of money in straight business, but margin is in the parlay. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=899.9799999999999s)]
*  That's where everybody's winning. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=903.5799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=904.5799999999999s)]
*  How do you, given that this is become a marketing war, how do you balance profitability and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=906.0600000000001s)]
*  growth, especially in this hyper competitive landscape? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=911.7s)]
*  You focus on your cohort economics. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=916.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you continue back to economic theory, marketing theory. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=918.82s)]
*  You invest until your marginal contribution equals your marginal cost. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=923.58s)]
*  And so we are fixated on that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=928.48s)]
*  And one of the challenges actually for our business is that our revenue stream, the cohort [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=933.58s)]
*  revenue stream, is non-linear. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=938.12s)]
*  So sometimes our players win, sometimes we win. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  On a weekly basis, 45% of our players do better than we do. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=946.0400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=951.64s)]
*  So estimating player lifetime value, cohort lifetime value, and making sure that that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=953.36s)]
*  is always current and right sizing your investment accordingly in real time is something that [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=962.08s)]
*  the team does very actively. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=969.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  So you had two of these targets in your site, DraftKings, FanDuel, but now you've got Disney [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  coming along with ESPN, probably one of the best known brands in the business. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=976.0s)]
*  How has that impacted the business overall? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=980.5200000000001s)]
*  And does that mean we've saw a slowdown on spending by some of your rivals, but all of [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  a sudden the spending on advertising has gone up? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=988.44s)]
*  Or are we going to get back to a sort of real war around this because they are such [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=990.72s)]
*  a big player? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  So underneath Disney is a different company. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=998.28s)]
*  One of the operators that has been in the market for a while. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1001.4s)]
*  So really the change is the name and the access, distribution. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1005.5400000000001s)]
*  What we saw, that company started fast in November, November last year, and as you'd [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  expect saw lots of downloads and a big splash and a flurry. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1018.08s)]
*  What we've seen subsequently is a significant slowdown, a significant moderation in their [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1022.5200000000001s)]
*  impact on the sector and their market shares in the states in which they operate. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  So now they're back to single digits and sometimes even low single digits. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1033.44s)]
*  And the other point to note is that they haven't really made an impact on the gaming side of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1038.22s)]
*  business. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1042.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1043.08s)]
*  So is there going to be a lift for your business as well because of the noise surrounding them [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1044.08s)]
*  jumping in or no? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1047.36s)]
*  Not really, not really. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1048.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1049.36s)]
*  Some of the competitors had said that might happen, raising all boats. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1050.36s)]
*  I expect over time we will see deeper penetration, broader market penetration and participation [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  as a result of them being in the market. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1061.3999999999999s)]
*  We saw that, I think they saw over two million downloads. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1065.04s)]
*  Some of those would have been first time to the sector. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1068.4399999999998s)]
*  And that's good for the regulated market. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1071.58s)]
*  I want to switch and talk a little bit about X because I think it was a week before you're [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1073.96s)]
*  about to go live. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1077.72s)]
*  You announced a partnership with X to basically be integrated into the platform. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1078.72s)]
*  Can you walk us through how you decided to align with X? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1083.72s)]
*  Obviously, there's plenty of marketers that have now sort of taken a pause or not gone [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1087.1599999999999s)]
*  on the platform because after Elon Musk took over, various reasons, whether it's the content, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1091.9199999999998s)]
*  brand safety concerns, what conversations internally did you have about taking that leap? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1096.8s)]
*  What convinced you to do it? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1102.92s)]
*  Well I think the starting point needs to be a recognition of where our players are and [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1105.44s)]
*  where the conversation takes place around live sports. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1109.68s)]
*  Live sports is one of the last things that we need to consume live. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  One of the last things that we watch live. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1119.96s)]
*  Maybe the eclipse. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  And the conversation around live sports takes place on X. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  And the board discussion was we are not taking a political position. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1130.32s)]
*  We need to be where our players are. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1136.36s)]
*  And that is on the X platform. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1139.24s)]
*  And so we were delighted to be the exclusive live odds provider to X. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1142.76s)]
*  And you know, on X, Bet MGM is always trending because live sports is always trending. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1147.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1152.44s)]
*  Did you look at any research or do any research to figure out if there would be any impact [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1153.36s)]
*  to your brand overall? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1157.52s)]
*  We didn't research that specifically, no. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1158.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1160.4s)]
*  And obviously it seemed to me it was very close to the Super Bowl. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1161.24s)]
*  It was literally like days before. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  Was there challenges with getting it done or what did you face when you did this? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1167.8400000000001s)]
*  Because it was pretty big integration. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1172.16s)]
*  It was a big integration. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1174.48s)]
*  And so we and the X team worked very closely collaboratively to get the technology to talk [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1176.0s)]
*  to each other, to think in real time. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1182.52s)]
*  How did that go given that we've written a lot about their tech team, like obviously [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1186.24s)]
*  there's so many people have left there. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1190.0800000000002s)]
*  Did that go smoothly or was that a struggle for you guys? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1192.44s)]
*  Largely smoothly. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1195.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, we have other examples of technical integrations before. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1196.0s)]
*  I wouldn't call this out as being any. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  Great. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1202.2800000000002s)]
*  I wanted to talk a little bit about we hit on it before, like the billion dollars that [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1203.24s)]
*  are spent in this market. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1208.0s)]
*  How do you stand out? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1209.48s)]
*  Because I said it to you the other day. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1211.68s)]
*  Every time I see I get on any feed, it's like one after the other. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1214.2s)]
*  How do you guys sort of look across and find places that aren't so crowded with your competitors? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1218.92s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1225.08s)]
*  So I mean, this is back to the comment I was making about the power of Nevada, the power [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1226.64s)]
*  of MGM Resorts. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1231.92s)]
*  We also talked about X with exclusive provider of live odds on that platform. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1233.44s)]
*  We also have a rewards economy. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1238.28s)]
*  So we are also the exclusive partner to Marriott Bonvoy. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1240.56s)]
*  So they're a distribution partner for us as a say exclusive in the category. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1245.52s)]
*  So we're looking for ways that we can lean into the things that make us different, MGM [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1250.4s)]
*  Resorts particularly. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1255.12s)]
*  Omnichannel as a concept, as a player experience is something that we think we do best. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1256.44s)]
*  I think you did that elaborately in Vegas for the Super Bowl. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1264.56s)]
*  I saw so much that you lean really heavily on outdoor in that market. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1267.12s)]
*  Is that something you're going to replicate at all of your different properties at MGM [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1271.3999999999999s)]
*  properties now or is that just like a one off because it was Super Bowl? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1275.9599999999998s)]
*  We absolutely do. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1278.7199999999998s)]
*  We have in property activation teams. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1279.8799999999999s)]
*  We will regularly host some of our digital only players in a real world environment. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1283.32s)]
*  We collaborate closely with the host team at MGM Resorts so that our digital players [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1288.8s)]
*  can have a premium experience in a physical world that they would otherwise enjoy in a [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1294.6s)]
*  digital world. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1300.32s)]
*  So there is that connectivity that I think we can offer differently from anyone else. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1301.32s)]
*  Great. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1307.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to take all the time. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1308.3999999999999s)]
*  But you guys probably have questions. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
*  Please feel free to raise your hand and we'll get a mic to you if there's anybody has a [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1311.32s)]
*  question. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1315.24s)]
*  Please raise your hand. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1316.24s)]
*  We have got mic runners and I'll keep going until somebody wants to jump in. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1317.24s)]
*  I wanted to ask you because I spent a lot of time with Matt, who's your CRO. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1321.8s)]
*  He's fantastic. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1326.12s)]
*  You should all meet him. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1327.12s)]
*  He carries the CRO and CMO title, which I thought was really interesting because again, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1328.6799999999998s)]
*  we're under another I feel like it's every two years the CMO title is under siege. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1334.2s)]
*  How did that evolve and why is this the right mix for your company? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1340.48s)]
*  So it's partly the extraordinary talents of the individual, partly through I'd like to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1347.96s)]
*  drive greater accountability throughout the business and the combination of marketing [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1359.16s)]
*  and some of the analytics allows me to drive that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  So some of the commercial teams as well as the analytical teams, the whole ecosystem [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1373.52s)]
*  is now accountable. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1379.96s)]
*  Great. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1380.96s)]
*  And do you think future proofing for companies that are on this path that the CMO should [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1381.96s)]
*  sit at the table with data analytics and if not own it? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1388.08s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1392.2s)]
*  It's definitely in my experience has been very effective in our business. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1393.2s)]
*  Great. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1397.0s)]
*  I definitely want to you brought up women betters and I wanted to talk a little bit. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1398.0s)]
*  Obviously we're all watching where Miss Iowa is going to go and what's going to happen [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1401.76s)]
*  and the ratings are coming out in a couple of hours. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  We know it's going to be another record breaker. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1409.44s)]
*  You did the Super Bowl ad. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1412.2s)]
*  You had Wayne Gretzky. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1413.2s)]
*  You had Vince Vaughn and obviously Tom. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1414.2s)]
*  How much marketing to women are you doing and is that an untapped marketplace? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1420.2s)]
*  It definitely feels very male to me. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1426.56s)]
*  So this is what an interesting topic at the moment. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1428.96s)]
*  The latent potential of women's participation in sports betting has been the mirage that [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1434.96s)]
*  has long been sought, never been cracked. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  That code has always remained just on the edge of opportunity all over the world. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1448.08s)]
*  There is this, in sports betting male participation dominates. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1456.6s)]
*  Dominates like 80% plus. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1461.84s)]
*  It's different in iGaming by the way where it's much more balanced. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1463.9599999999998s)]
*  Table gamers skew more male. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1468.28s)]
*  Slots generally skew more female. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1471.76s)]
*  But in the world of sports betting, I feel like we're at an interesting point and I don't [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1475.56s)]
*  actually how it's going to play out because what we're seeing is interest in women's sports [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1481.12s)]
*  obviously. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1487.12s)]
*  Caitlin Clark has captured the imagination, captured the emotion and in our world that's [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1488.12s)]
*  the recipe for participation. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1496.6s)]
*  And we saw more bets on Caitlin Clark, the player centric bets. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1501.2s)]
*  She was the second most bet on person in the men's and women's competition. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1508.64s)]
*  Only Zach Edie was ahead. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1514.8000000000002s)]
*  And so what this says is that there is interest in the women's sports. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1518.44s)]
*  Now the question is whether that translates into female fandom and then female adoption [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1522.0400000000002s)]
*  of the wager. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1530.16s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1533.0400000000002s)]
*  How do you stroke that? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1534.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean because you don't target women right now? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1535.0400000000002s)]
*  At the moment we don't. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1537.3999999999999s)]
*  Generally the ROI on more male centric advertising is higher. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1538.3999999999999s)]
*  So you've got to follow the money. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1546.36s)]
*  Is there an opportunity to be more explorative and maybe, maybe. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1550.52s)]
*  I feel like this is a moment. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1556.8s)]
*  I feel like the landscape has changed enough to warrant retesting. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1558.12s)]
*  You should come hang out with my tribe because we're betting on everything. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1564.4s)]
*  Come again. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1567.16s)]
*  I mean it's so much fun. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1568.16s)]
*  It makes it just like you're all hanging out. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1571.16s)]
*  I was surprised because when I was talking everybody was like there is no women targeted [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1572.92s)]
*  mark. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1576.64s)]
*  No. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1577.64s)]
*  It's very fascinating. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1578.64s)]
*  Well maybe she'll change that industry as well. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1579.64s)]
*  Talk a little bit about we're obviously exhausted from March Madness. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1581.88s)]
*  What's a bigger business driver for you guys? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1586.68s)]
*  Mouch Madness or the Super Bowl? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1588.96s)]
*  So Super Bowl as a single event is bigger, much, much bigger. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1591.92s)]
*  As given the tournament is 67 games. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1597.1200000000001s)]
*  In aggregate the tournament is bigger. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1600.52s)]
*  In terms of total volume, total betting volume, total bets the tournament is bigger. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1603.68s)]
*  But if you take Super Bowl and all the playoffs? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1607.44s)]
*  Oh I don't know. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1609.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1611.4s)]
*  And how much does Super Bowl drive in that single day? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1613.0s)]
*  Because there's all sorts of figures in terms of how big of a betting day it is. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1616.48s)]
*  What's the surge that you saw? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  And did you see a lot of surges on your app to download? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1622.6s)]
*  We do see a lot of surge. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1626.04s)]
*  As I said year on year we had 72% growth in the number of first time depositors. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1627.8799999999999s)]
*  We generally plan if the conference championships, the individual game is 1x it'll be 2x, that [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1633.8s)]
*  kind of volume. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  And that will probably be 10x the next event. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1645.76s)]
*  10x. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1650.36s)]
*  Well we can't get you to say you're going to do Super Bowl again are you? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1651.36s)]
*  Anyway any questions? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1656.36s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1657.36s)]
*  We have a question back in the back. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1658.36s)]
*  Hello Adam, it's Steven Wolf-Bereda from Televisión y Mision. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1659.36s)]
*  Thank you for being here and great job as always. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1662.36s)]
*  Two questions. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1667.76s)]
*  One, certainly Super Bowl in American football is great but the real football is obviously [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1668.76s)]
*  much, much better. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1675.16s)]
*  Slightly biased. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1677.52s)]
*  So I'm curious how does Copa América and the soccer in general in the states, do you [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1678.52s)]
*  see that increasing as well on your platform? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1684.72s)]
*  And then second more important question, who are you cheering for for the title race in [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1687.68s)]
*  the Premier League? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1693.12s)]
*  And full disclosure, I'm an Arsenal fan. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1694.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1697.4799999999998s)]
*  So we actually have an Australian head trader. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1698.4799999999998s)]
*  So they would argue that the football is even a different one than you're thinking of. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1704.4799999999998s)]
*  But that's a separate conversation. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1708.4799999999998s)]
*  Now in terms of the beautiful game we are seeing growth, we are seeing interest but [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1710.4799999999998s)]
*  the big four are by far, the big four US sports are by far the volume leaders. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1716.4799999999998s)]
*  The other for completeness, the other sport where there is a lot of interest and a lot [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1723.84s)]
*  of live activity is tennis, where about 80 to 90 percent of bets are in running, are [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1731.48s)]
*  live while the game is on. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1739.04s)]
*  And to your second question, I'm a suffering Spurs fan so I can't comment on it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1741.72s)]
*  Great. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1746.72s)]
*  Any other questions? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1747.72s)]
*  We have one right in the front. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1748.72s)]
*  That will be our final question. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1750.72s)]
*  Hi. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1751.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1752.96s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1753.96s)]
*  My bag is too heavy. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1754.96s)]
*  Or maybe I was thinking about betting too much. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1757.96s)]
*  My name is Carolyn Bao. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1760.96s)]
*  I'm with Apps Flyer. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1762.96s)]
*  We specialize in data. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1764.96s)]
*  So when you mentioned about data, it really made me wonder if you could elaborate a little [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1766.96s)]
*  bit more about CMOs should have deeper understanding of data to see at a table. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1771.96s)]
*  What are your thoughts with regards to a CMO that really demonstrate deeper understanding [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1779.2s)]
*  of data and measured by the type of data they understand, measured by the type of user and [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1784.2s)]
*  consumer journey they're instrumenting? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1793.2s)]
*  So what do you expect for the modern day CMOs? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1796.2s)]
*  That's a really important question, a difficult question because our landscape is so data [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1800.2s)]
*  rich. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1807.44s)]
*  Our sports betting landscape is so data rich. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1808.44s)]
*  Let me take a step back. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1813.44s)]
*  I love our business. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1816.44s)]
*  Our business honestly operates, I think, at the forefront of e-commerce. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1818.44s)]
*  There is a, because it's a zero sum game, there is a risk management element where we [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1823.44s)]
*  have to know everything about the player. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1833.44s)]
*  When they bet, how much before an event they bet, who's betting around them, are they [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1838.44s)]
*  generally winners in every sport or not? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1843.44s)]
*  This is just one aspect of it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1847.44s)]
*  That's before you've even got into the performance marketing element of our world. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1849.44s)]
*  That's before you've even got into the predictive analytics on player value, on the cohort [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1854.44s)]
*  stratification, on the value stratification, and the value stratification links to your [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1860.44s)]
*  CRM program and the, again, measurement of every CRM campaign against all of your cohorts. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1866.44s)]
*  These are just some of the elements that go into making the right marketing decisions. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1874.44s)]
*  This is why I think in order to market most effectively, to all of the top of funnel, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1881.44s)]
*  mid funnel work, you need to know all of the other stuff because that goes to value. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1887.44s)]
*  That goes to the ROI side of the equation, which is why to your question earlier, they [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1892.44s)]
*  need to be together. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPIt4jI6e4&t=1897.44s)]
