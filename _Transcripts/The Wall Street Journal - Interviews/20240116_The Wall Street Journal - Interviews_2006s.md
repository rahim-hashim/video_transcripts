# PepsiCo CEO on Tackling Inflation, Weight-Loss Drugs and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE)
*  I'm keen to talk to you in a bit about your about the food, in particular your snack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=0.0s)]
*  production. But first of all we're here in Switzerland at the heart of Europe, not far from [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=7.12s)]
*  France, not far from Italy, not even very far from your native Spain. So I wanted to ask you about a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=12.4s)]
*  spot of local difficulty you've been having with the grocery giant Carrefour and they are saying [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=18.16s)]
*  that they aren't stocking Pepsi products because the prices are too high, whereas you're saying [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=24.16s)]
*  no no we're not allowing them to stock it because we haven't reached agreement on a contract. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  So I'm just wondering what's going on there. I would say this is a very normal practice. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=34.56s)]
*  What is unusual is that it's made it to the press, but the fact that suppliers and customers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  get into commercial tensions is just a fact of life. In particular in the European context it's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=48.72s)]
*  even tougher. I find the US and the UK actually relationships much more win-win. So there's a much [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=56.4s)]
*  better collaboration with our customers in trying to build, grow the pie and then split the pie. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=66.32s)]
*  The relationship in particular in France and Germany is much more about splitting the pie [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=73.28s)]
*  and that normally becomes more difficult, especially in circumstances like now where [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=79.44s)]
*  we've been having a lot of inflation and so on on both sides. So the reality is much more complex [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=85.28s)]
*  as you can imagine. We won't talk about it, but I'm not concerned. We have very experienced people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=91.6s)]
*  on the ground. We have people that can build win-win and that's how we always approach these [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=98.32s)]
*  kind of relationships. I think that's how we build sustainable businesses. We're perceived [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  from our customers normally as a company that delivers growth and with growth comes profit for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=108.0s)]
*  both. So it is a situation that will solve itself very quickly. But can you put a time limit on how [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=114.56s)]
*  long French are going to have to wait to eat Cheetos again? No, but they can eat Cheetos in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=122.0s)]
*  many other customers. One of our principles is always everywhere. So we want our products to be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=126.72s)]
*  in every moment of the day for consumers and everywhere where they can shop. So [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=133.36s)]
*  rest assured that our consumers and we have a lot of loyal consumers everywhere in Europe, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=139.92s)]
*  they're finding our products. Since we're talking about pricing, what's your view on, there's obviously [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=144.88s)]
*  still a lot of talk around inflation. Generally there's this feeling that inflation has been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=149.68s)]
*  brought back under control, but there's still some underlying worry about it. As a retailer of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  your products, how do you see it? I think it's good for us, I think in this topic, to step back and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=160.16s)]
*  reflect what's happened to our businesses in the last four years. I think we've been through probably, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  and I've been around for 30 years as you were saying, in the company. I've never been through [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=174.48s)]
*  four years with this kind of incredible impact and disruption. You think about COVID, how we had to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=180.0s)]
*  pivot our organizations to try to supply consumers with half of the people at home, half of the people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=188.0s)]
*  in the factories. It was chaotic. Then once we got back to that, then inflation as a consequence of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=195.12s)]
*  that obviously took over. We had to absorb tens of billions of inflation in our company in two years. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=202.64s)]
*  This is unusual. It's the first time we had to do that. We've done it with a lot of productivity in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  our business, but also we had to be smart about taking pricing in a very consumer-sensitive way as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=214.48s)]
*  we tend to do things. Now the reality what we're seeing now is that things are normalizing finally. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=221.12s)]
*  So we're seeing supply chain stabilizing. We're seeing the labor market stabilizing. We're seeing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=226.72s)]
*  many of the large commodities starting to go back to lower levels of inflation. Not so much [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  in agriculture unfortunately. We're seeing that agriculture is still inflationary for next year. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=239.52s)]
*  That's due to a lot of bottlenecks in the agriculture industry. We're seeing a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=246.8s)]
*  moderation. Now I think we as a company, but everybody in the industry is thinking about, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=252.72s)]
*  okay, now I can run a better company. I can run a good company. I think we're all running [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=258.0s)]
*  suboptimal companies from many dimensions. Now the way I'm thinking about it is next year [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=263.04s)]
*  I'm going to raise the bar on excellence across all our market units. I'm going to try to optimize [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=268.72s)]
*  value equations. That probably had got a little bit off in some areas. I'm trying to dial up [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=275.36s)]
*  innovation. Obviously innovation is our main source of growth. We've kind of slowed down innovation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=281.28s)]
*  for a couple of years because supply chain wasn't ready for small things. Now innovation back at the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=287.6s)]
*  center, brand investment, etc. I think we're probably in the next 18 months we will see an [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  optimization of all the organization and the cost structures and the value equations in the commercial [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  plans, in the consumer plans. That's our core competence. Now the truth is that this disrupted [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=306.48s)]
*  four years that we had have made our companies, at least PepsiCo, much more resilient, much more [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=313.6s)]
*  agile, much more decentralized. So in our case I can see our leaders in every market having a mindset [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=321.04s)]
*  that they didn't have four years, five years ago. They're much more end-to-end owners of the business. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  They are much more agile. They see risk as an opportunity. When there is a problem they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=333.76s)]
*  immediately go into, okay how do I quickly react and take advantage of that opportunity. So I think [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=342.24s)]
*  it's been a very positive transition for us for sure and we're going to keep those cultural [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=347.92s)]
*  and skills in our leaders because I think we're going to need them. I don't think the world will [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  be stable from now. Where do you see the sort of headwinds? I mean are you at all affected by what's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=362.0s)]
*  going on in the Red Sea at the moment? I mean what are the things that worry you? Not so much [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=366.48s)]
*  by this particular point that you were referring to. We are a very, we're a local for local business [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=372.56s)]
*  right so I mean and that might be an advantage for us. We grow potatoes, we grow corn, we grow [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=378.24s)]
*  oats, we grow you know most of our crops we grow them in the market, in every market and we manufacture [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=386.0s)]
*  in every market and we sell in every market. So we're very local for local business. So we're [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=393.12s)]
*  isolated from what are the trade disruptions that happen although obviously we move some goods around [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=397.36s)]
*  but obviously geopolitics is a concern. Geopolitics is a concern. It's something you think about five [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=406.24s)]
*  years ago when we were thinking about our growth plans or our strategic plans. I would say geopolitics [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=411.92s)]
*  had less relevance. We're not thinking about so much the geopolitics. We're thinking more about [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=417.92s)]
*  the consumer and the customer and you know and our associates which are critical to us. Now we need [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=423.76s)]
*  to add other factors and just be you know be aware that those good you know things that we thought [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  would never happen are happening and they will impact our growth strategies probably long term. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  So you talked just now about innovation. So I wanted to sort of step back a bit and look [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  at your broader strategy. So we reported last year that you were your view is that the company [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=447.52s)]
*  rather than trying to encourage different more healthy snacks it was to double down on what [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=454.64s)]
*  you're known for which is fundamentally soda and chips and rather than trying to persuade people to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  choose healthier snacks you'd make these snacks the ones that people really want healthier. So I [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  wondered how that was going for you both in terms of sort of public health but also as a strategy [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=472.48s)]
*  for the company. Yeah it's like there's some misperceptions in what you're saying. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=477.68s)]
*  But you know let me try to address them and just give you the broader strategy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  We are a as I said a food and beverage company actually a convenient food and beverage company. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  That's how we define ourselves. We play into large very large categories. So you think about consumer [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=495.04s)]
*  convenient foods is about a trillion dollar category growing five to six percent globally [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  and beverages is also close to a trillion dollars growing five to six percent. So these are very [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=507.12s)]
*  large very fast growing categories that if you think about some of the macro trends that are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=512.96s)]
*  happening in the world with urbanization with new lifestyles to income households with increased [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=518.16s)]
*  disposable income in emerging developing countries those categories will continue to grow at very [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=525.2s)]
*  fast pace. So our you know I think we're very well positioned from that point of view. Now [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  how we participate in those categories I think our core capabilities and no matter what happens [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=536.0s)]
*  with the consumer will always be is we want to have we want to be the best at consumer insights [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=542.96s)]
*  consumer intimacy as we call it. So really understand consumers. We want to build indispensable [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=548.0s)]
*  brands. We want to be very good at superior R&D and product development and then have omnichannel [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=554.64s)]
*  execution superior to others. So those are the four things we want to be the best at. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=561.76s)]
*  Now if you think about what you were saying the consumer is in the process of evolution as has [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=566.72s)]
*  been for the last hundred years. So we that's why it's so important that we're very good at [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  consumer understanding and through that consumer understanding what we what we what we learn is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=577.6s)]
*  that consumers are are looking for different needs throughout the day different occasions and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=583.2s)]
*  our mantra is we want to be always everywhere in consumer life. So always everywhere. Now if you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=588.24s)]
*  take always everywhere what it means for us we're going to have to continue evolving our portfolio [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=593.44s)]
*  and there's four vectors that we you know we're very focused on our innovation. One is permissibility [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  as you said and I'll talk more about how we're approaching big changes to big things versus [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=603.76s)]
*  smaller things. So permissibility is one. Convenience is another one which is which is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=608.24s)]
*  you know critical with lifestyles. The other one is functionality. Consumers want more more functionality [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=613.44s)]
*  with their beverages and their under foods and then taste. Taste is still the number one [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  factor of choice right. So those four vectors and obviously where the the the intersection of those [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=627.76s)]
*  four are the winning products. So we keep innovating against that. Now what are the big [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=634.64s)]
*  spaces for us? One is evolving the portfolio and with those vectors. The other one is we we want to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=639.84s)]
*  move our portfolio into meals. We think that the convergence between snacking and meals is more and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=646.24s)]
*  more. We have the right to participate in meals. Mini meals, convenient meals with our current [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  products but also other products and we're starting to include our products in recipes, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=659.76s)]
*  in cooking, in culinary and you will see more of that in home and away from home. The [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=666.4s)]
*  the other big pillar for our growth strategy is make your own beverages and I think the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=673.12s)]
*  beverage industry is going to be disrupted or it's going to be you know a lot of it disrupted or [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  will create additional opportunities when we enable the consumer to make your own beverages. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=683.92s)]
*  We're doing that through a couple of things. One is SodaStream. The SodaStream business will help [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=689.44s)]
*  us enable consumers to create their own drinks. We're adding our own brands to that ecosystem [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=694.48s)]
*  and and it's throughout the day and then we're going very hard at powders and tablets. If you [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  think our our largest beverage brand after Pepsi is Gatorade. Gatorade is growing in powders and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=707.12s)]
*  tablets and imagine the convenience, the personalization that we can create and the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=716.0s)]
*  great taste and functionality. Then for us a huge growth opportunity is international. We have a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=722.16s)]
*  40 billion dollar international business which is larger than most of the consumer companies out [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=728.64s)]
*  there but it's still small compared to the opportunity that we have. So those are big [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=734.48s)]
*  vectors. Now to your point on are you deciding to improve your existing products or build new [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=738.48s)]
*  products? Both. Where we're creating a lot of smaller brands that you might not even know there [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  are PepsiCo. To go to some you know I would say premium consumers that are looking for differentiation [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=753.28s)]
*  in chickpeas or in rice or in you know some lentils or plant-based that's fine. We're creating [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  those brands of the hidden path. We're creating a lot of small brands. The real impact we have in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=767.36s)]
*  consumer is when we are transforming some of the bigger brands into healthier brands, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=772.48s)]
*  more permissible brands and that is complex and that is why I think it's a competitive advantage [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=779.12s)]
*  for us to have the best R&D in the industry because it's very difficult to make a great [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=785.92s)]
*  tasting lace with very low sodium and with all natural colors and flavors. That's very complex. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=792.48s)]
*  It is much easier to have a potato chips with a lot of sodium and artificial and that is what's [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=799.84s)]
*  happening in the industry. We are able and in many countries we have lace already below WHO sodium [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=805.2s)]
*  standards and natural colors and flavors. I think that's a huge impact in society. When you take a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=812.32s)]
*  brand like Pepsi which had 11 grams of sugar that was the average for the industry not only for our [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=818.96s)]
*  brands and now has seven or five grams you're making a huge impact in society and consumers [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=825.2s)]
*  cannot tell the difference right. So that's the complexity of the R&D system having [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=833.44s)]
*  products that are very great tasting and much less sugar in this case obviously zero sugar [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=839.0400000000001s)]
*  has been a great success and that's a very complex. So the more complex the products are [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=845.52s)]
*  the better it is for us because we can create advantage with our R&D. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=851.68s)]
*  But that's very interesting because there's a big movement at the moment against ultra processed [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=856.4s)]
*  foods. There's clearly a lot of concern and scientists and dieticians are beginning to [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=863.4399999999999s)]
*  make links between health and the extent to which a diet is ultra processed. How much are you [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=868.24s)]
*  thinking about that or how much are you worried about that because I imagine I mean most of your [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=874.08s)]
*  products would fall into the ultra processed category. Well to me the ultra processed debate [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=878.72s)]
*  is a continuation of everything we had for 20 years about sodium and fat and sugar. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=884.72s)]
*  So it is just another chapter. It is much less scientifically defined I must say. So I think [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=893.44s)]
*  public policy needs to do more work on that. However the ultra process to me has a risk [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=901.04s)]
*  that we vilify everything that is processed. If we want to feed the world we cannot feed the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=910.24s)]
*  world with fresh food. There needs to be a certain level of processing and at the end of the day [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=916.48s)]
*  that's what we do in our kitchens. The logic I'm using when we're briefing our innovation [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  our R&D teams is like use kitchen logic. Use kitchen logic. Like we see our factories as [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=930.0s)]
*  very large kitchens. We cook food in our plants. When I talk to our associates in the plant [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=938.56s)]
*  they're running maybe a huge potato chips line. They say I'm a cook. I'm cooking. They are proud [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=949.2s)]
*  of being cooks. If you think about what we do we take a potato we peel it we put it through a [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=956.72s)]
*  fryer. By the way it's a much better fryer than anything we can do in our homes. We control the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=961.6800000000001s)]
*  oil temperature. We control the oil quality. There's no acrylamide. It's always perfect versus when [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=966.72s)]
*  we cook at our house it's different. So clearly we're thinking about kitchen logic. So doing things [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=972.32s)]
*  that we do at home like Doritos. Doritos is just corn that we take into the factory. We make it [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=979.76s)]
*  into a corn masa and then we bake it. That's something we do in our house. So how many [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=986.16s)]
*  ingredients is there in a Dorito? It depends. In a unflavored tortilla chips that you do for dipping [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=993.52s)]
*  it's corn and oil and a little bit of salt. Something like so if you use the kitchen logic [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1000.8s)]
*  I think we can probably bring a bit more logic to this ultra process because ultra process is [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1008.4s)]
*  everything. A tomato ketchup is ultra processed. We need this. A piece of bread is ultra processed. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1015.6s)]
*  So I think we need to bring some logic to that debate and not vilify everything that is [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1022.72s)]
*  cooked. Everything that is somehow processed to give us food safety, to give us long-term [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1029.68s)]
*  products, go to rural areas. How do we bring food to rural areas? So those elements. So I think we [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1036.48s)]
*  will eventually bring some rationality to that debate. But of course we're looking at this [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1042.08s)]
*  with the same lens as I was saying earlier. We see it as a potential risk but we see it as a huge [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1047.4399999999998s)]
*  opportunity for us to bring R&D capabilities, to innovate, to move our products into spaces that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1052.72s)]
*  consumers would prefer. So I wanted also to ask you about another possible challenge to your business [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  which is the coming on board of weight loss drugs. Which obviously yeah they're coming on and there's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1065.76s)]
*  been some predictions that this is going to radically change in particular in the US the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1071.44s)]
*  food industry there because the demand for snacks and the kind of many of the products that you make [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1076.24s)]
*  will simply go down. So I wonder first of all you know how much of a challenge do you see [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1080.72s)]
*  weight loss drugs as being long term and secondly how are you responding to that challenge? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1085.44s)]
*  Yeah I think it's a good, listen it's a disruption that if [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1091.44s)]
*  you know if it materializes it could help a lot of people's life, well-being. So I think from the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1096.8s)]
*  medical point of view I think it's great. Now there's obviously we've been studying this [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1105.36s)]
*  development and there's a lot of question marks on speed and level of adoption and affordability [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1110.0s)]
*  and all that. So I mean we're following this with different levels of projection and you know [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1117.28s)]
*  with certain levels of certainty we can say that even in this will be a long-term impact if any [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  and it will be very minor to our organization because the portfolio has already hedges in [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1133.28s)]
*  itself right. So we have products that will be a little bit impacted products that will be [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1139.52s)]
*  positively so we have a lot of protein based products, we have sports drinks, we have a lot [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1144.32s)]
*  of categories that are balancing each other. The good news for us is I don't think it changes at all [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1149.6799999999998s)]
*  the strategy of the company. So if you think about all the vectors of innovation I was [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1155.92s)]
*  referring to permissibility, functionality, taste, convenience. That remains still actually I think [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  we're in a very good place. I think we will have time to adopt in case this became [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1167.2s)]
*  a bit more of an accelerated adoption. And so the only thing we're doing with R&D is [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1172.5600000000002s)]
*  is you know trying to understand better the you know the what happens to the consumers that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1178.8000000000002s)]
*  are taking this direct as an opportunity for us to innovate in the needs of that consumer. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1186.0800000000002s)]
*  And so we think this will be a you know a reality the same as some people are [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1191.68s)]
*  refusing to buy certain type of products or if you are in the dairy industry now is [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1199.44s)]
*  the lactose intolerant. I mean the industries go through these kind of realities and [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1204.8s)]
*  organizations evolve and we have the R&D opportunities and the M&A opportunities [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1210.24s)]
*  if needed to just keep transforming our portfolio so that we remain best in class and high performing [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1217.28s)]
*  companies as we want for our people and for our shareholders obviously. So I'm always fascinated [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1224.24s)]
*  by how a big company like yours in the food and drink space has different sort of products [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1231.44s)]
*  for different markets and I think it's fair to say that a lot of the products in Europe have got [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1237.68s)]
*  are already lower sodium, lower sugar. Is that because this is an intention that you want to [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1242.88s)]
*  roll out everywhere or is it simply in response to sort of government regulation? I think [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1249.2s)]
*  I think it's a fair observation. We're using Europe as a kind of living markets for a couple [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1254.8s)]
*  of things. For as you said innovation based on permissibility and we're also using Europe for [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1264.08s)]
*  packaging innovation. I think those are two areas where Europe I think is ahead of the rest of the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1273.52s)]
*  world. In part is the consumer is more advanced. I don't know if the consumer is more advanced [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1278.72s)]
*  because we're educated since we're little kids of certain things or if it's just regulations [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1283.12s)]
*  are making us that way. I don't know what it is but Europe is an ecosystem where the infrastructure [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1289.4399999999998s)]
*  for waste recycling is there, where consumers are more aware of certain trends and what I think [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1295.4399999999998s)]
*  actually the governments are doing very pragmatic well-thought legislation to evolve the portfolio. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1301.9199999999998s)]
*  I'll give you an example. In the UK there was a sugar tax that was put in place [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1308.64s)]
*  exactly maybe eight or ten years ago and obviously the government worked with us with all the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1318.0s)]
*  industry to what would be a pragmatic taxation system that would help the industry to evolve [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1322.96s)]
*  to have a healthy portfolio for consumers. Nine years later 95% of the coal-up business [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1330.1599999999999s)]
*  in the UK, our coal-up business is non-sugar. It's been to me a great example of how [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  legislation can help consumer evolution in a way that industries we will adopt. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1347.9199999999998s)]
*  We have Good R&D, we have our Pepsi Max in the UK is a great product. It's loved by people and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  over time legislation in this case a very pragmatic well-thought legislation has helped us evolve the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1362.72s)]
*  portfolio. Now this legislation is being adopted in many countries and we are actually lobbying for [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1369.44s)]
*  this. We're not lobbying but talking to the governments to say this is a great way of evolving [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1375.44s)]
*  the industry. So you would choose to take even without legislation you would choose to take that [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1381.28s)]
*  product? Listen we're a company that like the way we're thinking about ourselves and Steven is here [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1386.72s)]
*  as part of my team. We're thinking about ourselves as a we want to be a best in class and admire [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1393.76s)]
*  company. We want to be a best in class and admire company and we want to do that in two elements [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1399.92s)]
*  obviously financial performance and business performance but also in terms of impact. So we [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1404.72s)]
*  think of ourselves a best in class and admire in financial and in impact and impact is what you're [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1410.08s)]
*  saying like we want to make sure that our company and I think it's going to impact the financial [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1417.6s)]
*  performance we want to be best for the planet and best for people and that's why we we created this [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1423.04s)]
*  framework called PEP positive. PEP positive is the way we want to win in the marketplace long term. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  We think that without a big transformation on the way we do business from the way we source [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1434.24s)]
*  agriculture to the products that we sell that we won't be able to be a best in class company on the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1440.64s)]
*  performance side for a long term. So a part of that is what we a pillar that we call positive choices. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1446.08s)]
*  Positive choices is evolving our portfolio to the trends that you were saying lower salt, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1452.64s)]
*  lower sugar but also adding diverse ingredients diverse like we made a commitment just a [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1458.4s)]
*  month ago about we want to have 100 I think it's 150 billion servings of diverse ingredients. The [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  most important one for example is whole grains. If you look at the American diet the most deficiency [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1472.6399999999999s)]
*  in the diet in the American diet is fiber fiber so consumers don't eat enough fiber. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1480.08s)]
*  So just one thing we're working on is a whole grain Doritos right so taking Doritos which is [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1487.76s)]
*  a huge brand in the U.S. massive brand and making it whole grain that would impact massively the U.S. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  diet. Do you think they'll buy it given a choice? They will buy it if we don't talk about it which [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1500.72s)]
*  is one of the challenges that we have as marketeers. As marketeers and you know if somebody [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1506.08s)]
*  has it please let me know and you know you guys can help me but if we talk about Pepsi reducing [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1513.12s)]
*  sugar people don't buy Pepsi reduced sugar. If we talk about Lays lower sodium people don't buy [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  Lays lower sodium. If we talk about Doritos whole grain people will not buy Doritos whole grain [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1527.04s)]
*  which is challenging. So we have to make all these transformations without telling consumers [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1532.3200000000002s)]
*  that this is a better product for them. That is a challenge and I think it's a pity actually [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1538.16s)]
*  because it would be much better if we could you know tell consumers this is a better [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1544.0s)]
*  product for you but it's as tasty but they don't believe in it. They don't believe in it so it's [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  a challenge so if anybody in the room is a marketeer that I love your advice how to do it because this [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1554.0800000000002s)]
*  is a million dollar question for the food industry. Now how do we make better products [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1560.32s)]
*  and talk about them and we create consumer preference based on that. It's a bit like when [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1564.72s)]
*  you chop up vegetables and hide it in your kids food without telling them the vegetables. Yeah [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1570.0s)]
*  exactly it's just there's so much perception. So we've only got five minutes left I did quickly [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1574.08s)]
*  just want to ask you about plastic as well you're in trouble in New York with the attorney general [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  over plastics. Why is it proving so difficult to get to move away from single-use plastics? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1587.92s)]
*  Again there's a consumer dimension to this. I mean we're pushing Sotherstream ecosystem as [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1594.72s)]
*  much as we can. The adoption the number one country is Germany with adoption is only 12% [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1601.04s)]
*  of the families. So 12% of the households have Sotherstream and they're moved to a [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1609.52s)]
*  plastic free sort of consumption. We keep working on it we keep adding better flavors we keep adding [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1614.8s)]
*  things to the system we're moving as I said to powders and tablets which will eliminate plastic. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1621.52s)]
*  Now in many cases it's infrastructure for recycling is lacking and the right [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1626.6399999999999s)]
*  legislation to create that infrastructure is lacking so EPR which is extended producer [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1635.28s)]
*  responsibility regulations and we have it in Europe for many many years and I was you know [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1641.36s)]
*  a little boy when I started here in Europe and it's been a great success. Now we're trying to [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1648.08s)]
*  get that in the US we're trying to get the US to adopt a good EPR. Some countries like China for [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1653.6s)]
*  example don't even accept that we take bottles and we put them back into bottles which is clearly a [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1660.1599999999999s)]
*  something we need to as an industry we need to convince the Chinese government but those are [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1668.16s)]
*  the two largest consumer markets China and the US. The US lacks the infrastructure China lacks the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1672.4s)]
*  regulation so we're working on this. This is going to be a journey of consumer education the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1678.48s)]
*  industry clearly evolving and in its solutions and making them consumer friendly and but we're [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1683.92s)]
*  all making progress I think is one of the topics in Davos there is a global plastic treaty that is [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1692.56s)]
*  you know is being negotiated hopefully we can find you know areas of common agreement between [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1698.32s)]
*  all these different industries and different countries and we have something that helps us [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  move forward especially infrastructure for recycling. I think this is the biggest enabler [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1708.3999999999999s)]
*  that will reduce plastic you know pollution in the world. Good well I hope we've got time just for [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1713.36s)]
*  a couple of questions maybe. Hello. It's good to see you. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1719.9199999999998s)]
*  Hi my name is Surendra I'm in plastic recycling by the way but I have a different question. When I [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1729.9199999999998s)]
*  travel in India where I come from even in the interior of the villages where it's difficult [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1736.24s)]
*  to reach out with petrols we see your lays. What's the secret that without increasing the marketing [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1740.9599999999998s)]
*  cost you are able to provide there? That's always fascinating to me. Yeah listen as I said one of our [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1748.4s)]
*  pillars and capabilities is this omni-channel perfect execution so I think we are we're very [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1756.0800000000002s)]
*  local in India where you know again is an example of how we can become very local have you know [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1761.92s)]
*  multiple touch distribution system that reach the very rural areas and with our products there is [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1767.92s)]
*  also a knowledge in terms of making the portions that are affordable at five rupees to some of the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1776.0s)]
*  consumers in those areas so there is an end-to-end understanding of the consumers how much they can [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1783.12s)]
*  pay and then go back and say okay how do we build a business of this you know a full supply chain [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1789.2s)]
*  that allows us to sell at five rupees five rupees is what is it now because it's been devalued is it [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1795.28s)]
*  four cents right something like that so we can sell you know a bag of lays in India in rural areas [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1800.72s)]
*  for four cents and still make a decent profitability for the distributors and for us [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1806.56s)]
*  so these are this is how companies like ours the way I think about our company is we're a global [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1814.1599999999999s)]
*  company but not really a global company we are a you know 200 local companies that are run [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1821.04s)]
*  very locally for the cost structure of the of that country for the consumer of that country and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1827.92s)]
*  and then we're obviously enabling those local units to win in the marketplace with technology [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1833.6s)]
*  that is global with you know with some capabilities that are global with some you know some brand [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  strategies that are global but but everything is is local and unless we are very local especially [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1845.68s)]
*  in our cost structures and go to market we won't be able to compete with you know with very agile [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1851.2s)]
*  indian companies that you're familiar with so that's the reality I think we're successful at [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1857.28s)]
*  being a large global company that has a clear global vision but then being very empowered in [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1862.64s)]
*  in the marketplace and being localized so that's how we think about the business here we have [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1868.88s)]
*  another question hi my name is Sikandar Bishanjo I'm part of anchor corporation which is a diversified [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1873.04s)]
*  conglomerate based out of Pakistan Pakistan yes I'm also a global shaper my question is on the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1877.36s)]
*  geopolitics for example what's happening in the middle east brands like yours take the hit as [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1882.9599999999998s)]
*  well how do companies like yours balance in these massive disruptions that are happening in the world [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1888.4799999999998s)]
*  yeah I mean it's we need to learn to live with these disruptions and and and the middle east is [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1895.28s)]
*  as you said a good example and Pakistan is one of the markets where we're feeling a little bit of [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1902.7199999999998s)]
*  backlash especially in the Karachi area with with our brands and it's something that will go [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1906.64s)]
*  eventually and the you know we're we're so ingrained in countries like Pakistan we treat [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1913.44s)]
*  our people so well we're we're you know we're Pakistan for Pakistan yet we have some backlash [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1922.4s)]
*  right the same in Egypt the same in other markets I think this is the reality of global companies we [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1928.48s)]
*  have to live through this kind of disruption luckily the portfolio is very diversified so we [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1933.52s)]
*  can you know we can navigate through these transitions but you know again the philosophy [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1939.52s)]
*  we have I'm sorry the philosophy we have is to be local to be a company that is very rooted in the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1945.04s)]
*  communities in every part of Pakistan we're we're supporting the communities we're trying to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1951.76s)]
*  for the Pakistani consumers to believe that we are genuinely a company that brings value to Pakistan [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1957.2s)]
*  and we do it through agriculture we do it through creating incredible jobs that people have the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1962.72s)]
*  opportunity to grow from you know the very basic of the of the of the organization all the way to [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1967.3600000000001s)]
*  the top actually our GM in Pakistan started from being a salesman he's the GM of Pakistan he's an [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1972.48s)]
*  incredible guy you know Furkan so you know that's how we think about the business and I think that [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1978.32s)]
*  long term that would isolate ourselves from you know from being kind of pushed back by by communities [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1984.24s)]
*  or by by countries long term I know this this kind of impacts in our brands will not last too [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1990.0s)]
*  long because we have this consumer loyalty and this community loyalty in a way. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOjYyAZJdE&t=1996.4s)]
