# Reddit CEO on Its Role in the 2024 Election, Authenticity and Community | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE)
*  What is something, it's seven months, what's something that you just have learned in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=0.0s)]
*  last seven months? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=4.94s)]
*  What is something that you didn't know before you went public? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=5.94s)]
*  Oh my goodness, well I can tell you, I know I'm going to regret these words, my goodness, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=9.5s)]
*  I can hear it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=14.66s)]
*  No, you should say them then. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=15.66s)]
*  I've really enjoyed being public. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=16.66s)]
*  I think being public has been much more pleasant than going public. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=18.02s)]
*  It took us two years to get out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  We thought we were going to go out in April 2022. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=28.38s)]
*  And so that was a journey. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=33.0s)]
*  So I think just being out and being able to work and think about the product and think [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=35.04s)]
*  about the team, that has been honestly a relief. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=40.12s)]
*  And so reaction from the market was good? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=43.86s)]
*  I mean, better than expected? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=47.04s)]
*  What you expected? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  It's certainly what we hoped for. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  We're up quite a lot and the goal at the IPO was, one of the reasons to go public at [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=53.48s)]
*  all is we wanted our users to have an opportunity to be owners of Reddit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Reddit is people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=68.12s)]
*  Everything interesting about Reddit was and is and will be created by our users. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=69.69999999999999s)]
*  And so we wanted them to have an opportunity to not just have that sense of ownership but [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  to be actual owners. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=79.24s)]
*  The thing about going public is and having our users in retail more broadly participate [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=81.5s)]
*  in the IPO, you really want the price to go up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=87.66s)]
*  So I think in that regard, it worked out really well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=91.88s)]
*  So we're very thankful and fortunate for how that's gone so far. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=96.72s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=99.5s)]
*  I want to come back to talking about your users. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=100.5s)]
*  But I want to talk about three different topics today. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=101.94s)]
*  They all start with A. We're going to talk about answers, AI, and ambitions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=104.38s)]
*  I'm going to start on answers because how many people here use Reddit? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  How many people use Google? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  How many people use Google to get to Reddit? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  So I use Reddit directly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=124.9s)]
*  I use Google to get to Reddit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=127.1s)]
*  And I just find that more and more I'm relying on Reddit for search, for getting information. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=128.78s)]
*  So your experience is, I mean, as the hand showed, not unique. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=135.1s)]
*  Here's kind of a wild stat that I learned just a couple weeks ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=141.34s)]
*  In the United States in 2024, Reddit is the sixth most searched word on Google. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  We're somewhere between news and maps. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  And so people are going to Google with the intention of ending up on Reddit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=155.54s)]
*  And I think what's happening is people know that Reddit has answers, advice, perspective [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  on just about whatever you're looking for. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=171.62s)]
*  So at this point, it does feel like we're married to Google. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we're seeing more and more people learn that Reddit has just [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=180.22s)]
*  pretty much everything that you're looking for. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=188.26s)]
*  Yeah, we can get in. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=190.62s)]
*  Maybe it's like a little bit of a prenup there we can talk about in a little bit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=191.26s)]
*  But in terms of people are calling this new wave search 3.0, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=195.3s)]
*  The idea of sort of melding of social and search. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=201.78s)]
*  Why do you think it is that Reddit has sort of seen this explosion in people coming for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=205.46s)]
*  information? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=211.26s)]
*  I think Reddit is communities and conversation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=212.26s)]
*  And we have communities for literally anything that you're into or going through. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=214.34s)]
*  And so a lot of internet searchers, a significant portion of just general searches on the internet [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=220.18s)]
*  are questions. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  And so if you have questions, there's just a high likelihood that Reddit, where people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  have been talking about everything for almost two decades, has an answer or perspective [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=233.18s)]
*  on whatever it is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=239.46s)]
*  And one of the interesting things that I've both kind of experienced as a user, but also [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=241.42s)]
*  as somebody working on Reddit, is we've seen how Reddit evolves with people's lives. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=248.61999999999998s)]
*  And so what I was into 20 years ago, let's call it programming in video games, it's still [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  on Reddit. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=261.38s)]
*  But now what I interact with on Reddit is like parenting in San Francisco. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=262.38s)]
*  And so Reddit is just really, really broad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=268.58s)]
*  And the way we describe it is basically Reddit, whether you're 17 or 70 or a nerd or normie, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=271.06s)]
*  man, woman, or anything in between, Reddit has a home for you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=279.74s)]
*  And I think that's unique on the internet, something that has that sort of broad appeal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=286.14s)]
*  You've said before that Reddit is the most human place on the internet. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=292.02s)]
*  That was your own quote. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=295.54s)]
*  AI has come along now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=298.22s)]
*  And I'll ask actually again, I'm just going to keep asking audience questions and having [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=299.94s)]
*  everyone raise their hands. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=303.26000000000005s)]
*  Who's heard of AI slop? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, AI slop is this idea that basically we're going to be invaded by all of this, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't know, I really want to say crap, just AI crap. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=311.98s)]
*  And we're going to kind of be washed away in this text that is not really human. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=315.94000000000005s)]
*  And part of that's a fear that will happen on Google, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=321.38s)]
*  That we'll have all these AI search results. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=324.1s)]
*  But if Reddit is the most human place on Earth, are you fearful that some of this AI slop [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=326.66s)]
*  might make its way to your platform? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=331.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, the AI has to come from somewhere. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=334.42s)]
*  And so the source of artificial intelligence is actual intelligence. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=336.98s)]
*  And that's what you find on Reddit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=343.38s)]
*  And indeed, the Reddit corpus is a significant part of the training of the major foundation [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  models. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=355.9s)]
*  Again, that's because there's colloquial words about pretty much every topic, constantly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=356.9s)]
*  up to date. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=366.46s)]
*  But I think your observation is true, which is it does seem like there's a general lowering [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=368.73999999999995s)]
*  of quality on the Internet, because more and more content is written by AI. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=373.62s)]
*  Which the paradox there is that I think it actually makes Reddit stand out more as the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=379.5s)]
*  place where there's all of this human content that ends up being used to train AI. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=385.02s)]
*  And so there's, I think, an interesting connection there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=392.14s)]
*  But what people want is to hear from other people. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=396.46s)]
*  And they want not just the answers and information from other people, but also that sense of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  belonging and connection and community that Reddit provides. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=404.97999999999996s)]
*  So do you think of yourself as the owner of the world's best AI training data? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=409.85999999999996s)]
*  We're certainly up there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=415.34s)]
*  It is a valuable corpus. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's unique about Reddit versus the other social media [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  platforms is Reddit's open. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=424.85999999999996s)]
*  And we've always been open. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  So you don't need an account. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=429.06s)]
*  You don't need to pay to see the content on Reddit. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  If you put something on Reddit, it's public. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  It can be indexed in search engines, which has, I think, benefited our community and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=437.38s)]
*  Internet consumers at large. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=441.18s)]
*  It's helped these big AI models come to exist. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=444.1s)]
*  Now, we've had to make some decisions about that and figure out our place in this ecosystem. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=448.82s)]
*  Earlier this year, we created what we call a public content policy, which sits alongside [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=454.62s)]
*  our privacy policy, which basically every platform has a privacy policy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=461.18s)]
*  This is what you'll do with personal and private information. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=463.9s)]
*  For Reddit, it's very simple. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=466.66s)]
*  It never leaves Reddit to the extent that we have any at all. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=467.94s)]
*  But our public content policy governs what happens to the public content that you put [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=471.94s)]
*  on Reddit. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=478.58s)]
*  So just to differentiate, private would be my direct messages to you or something? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=479.58s)]
*  Direct messages, what you're subscribed to, what you're looking at on Reddit. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=485.58s)]
*  That's private. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=489.78s)]
*  Now, on Reddit, Reddit's also unique in that we actually don't know your name. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=490.78s)]
*  We don't know your name and gender. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=494.54s)]
*  We do have to ask age now for increasingly for safety reasons. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=497.38s)]
*  But by and large, we try to minimize what we know about you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=502.02s)]
*  And what we do have, we keep private. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  But anything you write on the Internet, we want to be clear that this goes on the public [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=508.34s)]
*  Internet. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=511.26s)]
*  And what can happen with that data, which is, you know, we'll say we'll do commercial [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=513.94s)]
*  agreements subject to some important guardrails about, for example, not using that data to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=516.94s)]
*  identify our users. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=523.62s)]
*  We've done noncommercial agreements with nonprofits and researchers and that sort of thing as [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=525.54s)]
*  well because we know that information is useful to all sorts of entities, big and small, for-profit [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=528.5s)]
*  and not. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=535.74s)]
*  And for the audience, and I want to get into this, but you do have deals right now, OpenAI, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  Google, they're paying you for training data and they bring that in. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=541.9s)]
*  And that's, I assume, a healthy profit in the business. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=546.26s)]
*  Yes, so we do have partnerships, yes, with both Google and OpenAI. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=550.14s)]
*  We've also done free ones with places like the Internet Archive. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=554.0999999999999s)]
*  We have this whole initiative called Reddit for Research as well to make our corpus available [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=558.5799999999999s)]
*  for people doing research, whether it's on the Internet, whether it's on social dynamics [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=562.9s)]
*  or AI. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=567.5s)]
*  Again, we think generally the Internet is better when it's open and interconnected. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  But we also need to make sure that we're finding a way, you know, we're not just giving away [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=575.06s)]
*  the value of Reddit to the largest companies in the world for free. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=579.2199999999999s)]
*  Are there companies that you feel are taking that data and not paying? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the ones I didn't mention by and large. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=587.26s)]
*  There's like a Microsoft in there, is one of them, I'm assuming. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=589.58s)]
*  Look, we're in talks with just about everybody. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=595.1800000000001s)]
*  I'd say each are at various stages. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=597.58s)]
*  So you know, we'll see where these things land. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=602.54s)]
*  But like I said, I think it's better for the Internet to be more connected. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=604.34s)]
*  And that really is Reddit's heritage, is being open and being in there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=610.1s)]
*  So we just want to make sure we're doing so on terms that are, I think, sustainable for [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=614.94s)]
*  our platform. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=618.74s)]
*  And then just to bring it back to users, what do you say to the users who say, okay, I put [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=620.1s)]
*  this public information out there, now I'm being used as training data. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=624.4200000000001s)]
*  How can I profit off of that? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=627.62s)]
*  So again, I think it's important to be clear with our user base. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=629.7s)]
*  That's why we did the public content policy, that even without the AI world that we're [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=632.9s)]
*  living in, you're putting something on the public Internet. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=639.38s)]
*  We will do our best to safeguard it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=643.02s)]
*  We will do our best to only have relationships with partners that we think are trustworthy [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=644.9s)]
*  and will abide by our principles. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=650.74s)]
*  But you know, we've been getting scraped every which way. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=655.18s)]
*  And so we've invested a lot over the last couple of years in locking that down. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=658.66s)]
*  But it is an arms race. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=663.62s)]
*  So again, this is, I think, just important to understand about Reddit. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=665.06s)]
*  This is the public Internet. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  But again, we also try to protect our users by not requiring private information. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=672.06s)]
*  I think it's an important part of Reddit that you don't bring your real world baggage to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=682.06s)]
*  Reddit or take your Reddit reputation off of the platform. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=686.8199999999999s)]
*  And in this regard, Reddit's an anonymous platform and amenity is safety, which I think [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=694.1s)]
*  is a misconception. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=700.14s)]
*  People often wonder, oh, Reddit's anonymous. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=701.14s)]
*  Isn't that less safe? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=704.78s)]
*  It's actually more safe because people are free to be themselves and don't have to kind [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=705.78s)]
*  of deal with that kind of real world mixing. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=710.46s)]
*  One of the things that I think that has made Reddit so successful over the last couple [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=715.22s)]
*  of years is that you really cleaned up the place. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=718.5400000000001s)]
*  You're basically the cleanup guy, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=720.98s)]
*  You made more communities around substantial topics, got rid of a lot of misinformation [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=724.14s)]
*  or trolling or just bad behavior. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  General bad behavior, yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=733.26s)]
*  Bad stuff. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  You've got an election going on. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  And wanted to see, have you found that in this election process that it's been harder [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=741.22s)]
*  to keep some of that type of content off of the platform? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=746.74s)]
*  No. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=749.86s)]
*  Look, we've been through a number of big presidential elections. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=750.86s)]
*  We've been around 19 years. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=754.26s)]
*  So this is not our first rodeo by any means. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=756.02s)]
*  Look, emotions are heightened for sure. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=761.34s)]
*  But Reddit is, I think, naturally inoculated from a lot of the challenges you might see [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=765.94s)]
*  elsewhere on the internet. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=770.54s)]
*  First, our users self-organize into communities that we call subreddits. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=771.94s)]
*  So whatever your perspective is, whether it's in this election or anything else, whoever [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=778.0999999999999s)]
*  you people are, you can hang with them. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=781.5799999999999s)]
*  And then on Reddit, every user is a moderator because they can vote up and down. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=784.9399999999999s)]
*  And every post and comment on Reddit starts at zero points and has to earn its visibility. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=789.66s)]
*  We don't have an algorithm that cherry picks a piece of content and makes it popular. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  It has to earn its visibility one vote at a time, up or down. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  So naturally, polarizing posts can get the same number of ups and downs and then, therefore, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=803.66s)]
*  stay at zero. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=809.9s)]
*  And so Reddit just works in a fundamentally different way from other platforms. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=810.9s)]
*  And that really, I think, changes the tone of conversation and the incentives. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=816.42s)]
*  It seems quite different than X and what's happening on that platform right now. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=822.5799999999999s)]
*  Have you seen any benefit to your business? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=828.02s)]
*  Have you seen any benefit to what Elon Musk has done on that platform? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=832.38s)]
*  It's hard to pinpoint Reddit's growth to any one thing, not just any one thing with other [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=836.58s)]
*  platforms, but any one thing. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=843.46s)]
*  I think this has been one of the interesting things about Reddit is we have a two-decade [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=845.58s)]
*  perspective. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=849.1800000000001s)]
*  And so if you looked at our traffic graph over the last 19 years, you would not see [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  world events. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=856.12s)]
*  It's actually been very consistent. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=857.12s)]
*  Now on Reddit, there's always some subreddit, some community that's having a moment. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=860.18s)]
*  But when you look at them in aggregate, Reddit's just been very consistent. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=866.2199999999999s)]
*  And so our work over the last couple of years, and we're at all-time user highs last quarter. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=869.7399999999999s)]
*  We've been growing really nicely the last couple of years. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  What's driving that is not macro trends. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=881.9799999999999s)]
*  It's really we just made Reddit easier to use. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=885.66s)]
*  I used to do a talk like this, and maybe I'd give the pitch of my life about Reddit. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=888.42s)]
*  And then somebody would go check Reddit for the first time, and they'd open it, and they'd [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=892.62s)]
*  be like, what is that guy talking about? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=895.5s)]
*  This is just like memes, teenager stuff. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=897.1s)]
*  We've gotten much better at helping new users, when they open the app or visit the website [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=900.58s)]
*  for the first time, be successful in finding their home. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=907.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's really what's driving the growth over the last couple of years. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=910.8s)]
*  The White House just brought back their Reddit page a few weeks or months ago, I believe. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=914.5s)]
*  And they're active there. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=919.82s)]
*  So it seems like also it's more of these legitimate organizations and politicians or celebrities [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=921.1800000000001s)]
*  or whatnot also being active on the platform. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=927.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=929.78s)]
*  So in this case, the White House created an account to disseminate information about the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=930.78s)]
*  hurricane. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=935.02s)]
*  And in their words, I believe they said, we want to meet people where they are. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=936.02s)]
*  And so I think this is really fascinating. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=940.86s)]
*  They've been in, by and large, small local communities where they can talk to people [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=942.86s)]
*  who are having very specific issues. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=948.62s)]
*  And then politics more broadly, we have a thing on Reddit called the AMA, the Ask Me [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=951.74s)]
*  Anything. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=957.42s)]
*  And this is really a product built by our users for doing interviews on Reddit. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=958.66s)]
*  And it's one of the most humanizing things someone can do. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=963.3000000000001s)]
*  And so whether you're a politician, we've had some big ones over the years, or one of [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=967.22s)]
*  our most popular AMAs ever, a vacuum cleaner salesman, it shows, I think, a side of people. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=973.34s)]
*  And Reddit more broadly, I think, shows a side of humanity that we don't always get [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=982.78s)]
*  to see. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=986.58s)]
*  And I think that's what's really special about Reddit versus a lot of the rest of the internet. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=987.58s)]
*  It's funny because this is one of the posts on the White House page. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=992.34s)]
*  And you're totally right. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=994.9s)]
*  There's a lot of great posts there about what they were doing about relief. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=995.9s)]
*  But my favorite thing is if you scroll down on this page, they're all saying that this [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=999.38s)]
*  just looks like a Getty stock image. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1003.1s)]
*  And it truly is. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1005.34s)]
*  So it gets to the heart of what's, I think, really the community of Reddit. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1008.42s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1013.74s)]
*  I mean, look, if you're going to post a Getty stock image, you're also going to get called [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1014.74s)]
*  out on it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1020.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1021.5s)]
*  I mean, or if it looks like one. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1022.5s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to say. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1023.5s)]
*  It's a little far away. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1027.06s)]
*  But I can tell you. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1028.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1029.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1030.06s)]
*  Reddit has been, I think, the world's best bullshit detector since its inception. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1031.06s)]
*  And I think it's one of the things that people really appreciate about Reddit is that it [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1036.5s)]
*  is authentic. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1040.3s)]
*  It's not always squeaky clean. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1043.74s)]
*  It's not always perfect. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1045.62s)]
*  It's not manicured. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1046.62s)]
*  But it's real. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1048.38s)]
*  And that's what I think people crave. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1049.62s)]
*  And again, that's another thing I think driving the growth that we've seen over the last couple [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1051.5400000000002s)]
*  of years is people want real. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1055.46s)]
*  They want to know what other people say and think. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1059.0600000000002s)]
*  And that's really not just part of Reddit. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1062.46s)]
*  It's really all of Reddit. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1064.94s)]
*  I'm going to go to audience questions here in a few seconds. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1067.94s)]
*  But you have talked a lot about the open Internet. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1070.98s)]
*  And as you mentioned here, Reddit is many, many years old now. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1074.22s)]
*  If you look far out, what is your biggest fear about either AI or this next wave of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1079.54s)]
*  the Internet? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1086.78s)]
*  What is your fear? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1087.78s)]
*  I think I don't have a kind of a fear-based lens of the world. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1091.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm actually just very excited. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1097.8999999999999s)]
*  I've had the privilege, the true privilege of working on Reddit and seeing every day [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1100.6999999999998s)]
*  how people behave when nobody's watching. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1108.8999999999999s)]
*  And they are funnier and nicer and more supportive and kinder than I think we give the general [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1114.26s)]
*  population credit for. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1120.18s)]
*  And I know this because I see people every single day just helping each other. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1122.5s)]
*  On Reddit, you can spend one of a subreddit that's been really important to me over the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1127.82s)]
*  years to stop drinking. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  I quit drinking five years ago. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1132.7s)]
*  You can go to that subreddit today. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1134.82s)]
*  And I guarantee on the front page, you'll see somebody celebrating a milestone, maybe [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1136.78s)]
*  100 days, maybe a year, maybe five years. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1141.82s)]
*  You'll see somebody thinking about drinking again. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1144.34s)]
*  And you'll see everybody pulling them back. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1150.1s)]
*  And you'll see somebody who literally just had the worst day of their life and is posting [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1152.18s)]
*  about it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1157.06s)]
*  And there will be hundreds of people telling that person that they have a new lease on [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1159.14s)]
*  life as soon as they decide to take it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1165.74s)]
*  And they're giving that advice for no other reason than it feels good to do so or that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1168.02s)]
*  they want to be helpful. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1173.46s)]
*  Because you don't get to take it with you. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1174.46s)]
*  And I think that's what's really special. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1176.66s)]
*  And seeing people do that makes me actually very excited about the future and whatever [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1178.3400000000001s)]
*  small role that we can play in it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1184.46s)]
*  That sounds like to me the total antithesis of AI slop. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1186.8999999999999s)]
*  So I'm also optimistic when I hear you talk about that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1190.1399999999999s)]
*  We have time for probably one or two questions. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1193.9399999999998s)]
*  Any questions out there? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1198.6999999999998s)]
*  I would find someone. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1199.6999999999998s)]
*  What is your favorite subreddit? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1201.8999999999999s)]
*  We're going to go over there. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1202.8999999999999s)]
*  Favorite subreddit right now is probably Dadit. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1204.86s)]
*  It says the name implies it's a subreddit for dads. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1209.26s)]
*  And again, that subreddit is like a lot of these subreddits. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1211.5s)]
*  If you go to the front page, you'll probably see something funny. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1215.82s)]
*  You'll probably see something that'll make you cry. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1218.62s)]
*  You'll probably see somebody who just needs some help. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1221.34s)]
*  You'll probably see some poor guy who just needs a hug. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1224.1s)]
*  But that's I think it's the real of the world there for everybody to see and experience. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1227.78s)]
*  It's really special. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1235.4199999999998s)]
*  We'll go over here. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1236.4199999999998s)]
*  Hi, my name is Lottie Jones. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1237.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm from the news movement. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1239.4199999999998s)]
*  We do social first news for Gen Z. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1242.02s)]
*  And actually, it's not really a question, but I'd just love to hear you talk around [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1245.42s)]
*  how as more journalists and news sources are defecting from X, how you're working with [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1248.8600000000001s)]
*  news media, particularly around issues like tackling misinformation. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1256.18s)]
*  And then I suppose in a bit more of a positive place, how news and journalists as individuals [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1262.22s)]
*  stronger and better communities around their own desks and notions of expertise? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1268.98s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1275.6200000000001s)]
*  I think we'll look. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1278.06s)]
*  So Reddit's heritage has been in links. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1279.9s)]
*  When we started Reddit 2005, Reddit was only links. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1284.78s)]
*  So we only linked to external sources. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1288.54s)]
*  A lot of the rest of social media, they don't link anymore. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1291.26s)]
*  They try to keep people in. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1295.26s)]
*  And that's never been our aim. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1297.9s)]
*  And so a lot of Reddit is still links. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1301.5400000000002s)]
*  What we want to be is the conversation around whether it's news or anything else. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1303.74s)]
*  And so I think we've long had a relationship, an informal relationship with publishers, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1311.3000000000002s)]
*  because we send them a lot of traffic and we're the place that people talk about these [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1317.5s)]
*  things. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1320.74s)]
*  What I'd love to see is I think how we can better support that community. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1323.42s)]
*  I think creating, as we look forward, first class features for publishers, better ways [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1331.18s)]
*  for the authors, the writers, the creators themselves to be more present on Reddit, just [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1339.3000000000002s)]
*  talking in the mix, talking about their stuff. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1344.8600000000001s)]
*  And so I think there's a lot of opportunities there for sure. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1347.74s)]
*  I'd say today, from a feature point of view, it's OK. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1350.82s)]
*  But I just think there's a lot of things we can do there, again, in the spirit of the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1354.86s)]
*  web, just enriching the connections, enriching the experiences for both the creators and [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1359.86s)]
*  our users who are the talkers. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1365.46s)]
*  I'm going to go one more here. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1369.4199999999998s)]
*  Hello. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1372.74s)]
*  My name's Neryana Michael, and I can attest I like how optimistic you are. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1374.1799999999998s)]
*  Some of the realest conversations I've ever seen, I go down some rabbit hole. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1380.3s)]
*  It's amazing. It's real. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1384.1s)]
*  So I have a question. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1385.94s)]
*  Since a lot of the AI, many major companies are using this information that you've collected [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1387.82s)]
*  over the 19 years to train them over time, because it's such a vast amount of data, they [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1395.26s)]
*  will be so well trained that you mentioned, you know, you get an up vote or a down vote. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1403.46s)]
*  They'll be trained how to imitate a human, let's say, and they could somebody put out [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1410.38s)]
*  a million down votes or up votes that the regular humans, how do you stop that type [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  of interference that might in the future result from the information that the models may have [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1423.46s)]
*  learned of how to be more human and preventing those who may not want to use it properly. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1429.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1435.3s)]
*  So thanks for the question. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1436.3s)]
*  You touched on a couple of things there. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1437.3s)]
*  So yes, the conversation and the words on Reddit are used to train these models, which [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1438.74s)]
*  I actually think is important, helping these models be better. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1443.94s)]
*  These models are creating an incredible amount of value for humanity. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1450.46s)]
*  Obviously there are risks there that I think the greater community is working through. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1454.78s)]
*  What you mentioned, though, is voting. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1458.94s)]
*  And so we call that coordinated inauthentic behavior and or cheating would be the one [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1460.74s)]
*  word description of it. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1468.74s)]
*  And we've been fighting cheating or manipulation on Reddit for 19 years. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1470.18s)]
*  Long before AI, people have been trying to get to the front page of Reddit for whatever [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1476.66s)]
*  reason. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1482.3400000000001s)]
*  That is in particular what we look out for is groups of people trying to make something [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1483.9399999999998s)]
*  more popular than it would otherwise be. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1489.6999999999998s)]
*  It is an arms race. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1493.8999999999999s)]
*  We're constantly learning and evolving there. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1494.8999999999999s)]
*  But the good news is we can see everything. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1497.82s)]
*  And so it's hard to manipulate Reddit, I think, at scale, but something we take very, very [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1501.1399999999999s)]
*  seriously. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1506.82s)]
*  That's the most important part about Reddit, because that's what lets Reddit be real and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1507.82s)]
*  authentic as opposed to manipulated. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoAVZ2ferE&t=1514.54s)]
