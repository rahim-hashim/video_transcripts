# JPMorgan Chase’s CFO on Customer Behavior and the Local Banking Factor | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o)
*  So let's start broad on that US consumer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=0.0s)]
*  You guys, as Chase, have unparalleled access into data and health of the US consumer, both ins and outs. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=3.5s)]
*  So what are you seeing right now? How does that look? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=11.5s)]
*  Sure, and of course there's a lot to dig in here, but before we do, maybe I thought I would just give everybody a sense of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=14.5s)]
*  just the scale and type of data we look at, given the scale of our franchise. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=21.5s)]
*  Many of you probably bank with Chase, but we do bank 80 million Americans across both checking accounts, mortgages, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=26.0s)]
*  and of course with our leading credit card franchise. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=33.0s)]
*  So across those 80 million consumers plus 6 million small businesses in the US, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=35.5s)]
*  we have a fairly comprehensive view of not only their balance sheets, what's their deposits, what's their lending, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=41.5s)]
*  but also really their cash flow and spending. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=47.0s)]
*  And so that's the type of data we monitor at a very granular level. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=49.5s)]
*  We do supplement it, of course, with government data, with 20 years of bureau data, but that's just the richness of what we look at. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=53.5s)]
*  So kind of breaking down at what we're seeing, we just heard Speaker Ryan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=60.0s)]
*  The economy overall and the labor market overall continues to be very strong. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=65.0s)]
*  And so while we continue to look for cracks, if you really have to summarize it up, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=70.5s)]
*  we consider US consumers still being pretty healthy, and so are small businesses. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=75.5s)]
*  Now within that, there's plenty of trends that you can break down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=81.5s)]
*  We look at wages. Wages have largely kept up with inflation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=84.5s)]
*  Although in lower income segments, they've actually experienced the largest real wage gains over the sort of pre-pandemic to post-pandemic experience, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=88.5s)]
*  and that translates to higher spending as well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=96.5s)]
*  There's one measure we really try to boil it down to, and we call it cash buffers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=99.5s)]
*  It's a very simple concept. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=104.5s)]
*  It's basically the number of days that a consumer can continue to spend at their current rate without getting a new cash inflow, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=105.5s)]
*  whether it's new income or whether it is taking out another loan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=113.5s)]
*  And historically, that number was very, very stable anywhere between somewhere around two to three weeks, of course, depending on income groups. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=117.5s)]
*  And so most paychecks come every two weeks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=126.5s)]
*  So having a cash buffer between two to three weeks has consumers fairly stable until and unless unemployment spikes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=129.5s)]
*  And that's really sort of the underlying thesis we look at. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=138.5s)]
*  What about in terms of spending, right? There's been a lot of talk of, OK, all the numbers say the economy is good, but people are worried. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=142.5s)]
*  People are anxious. Do you see that in spending? Like in reality, are people acting anxious? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=149.5s)]
*  Not yet, although I would say people are certainly starting to change and modify some of their spending behavior at the margin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=154.5s)]
*  And so we can break that down a little bit in general. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=162.5s)]
*  Of course, during the pandemic, spending after the initial drop, spending really spiked and has been at the steady growth throughout 2023, even on a year on year basis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=166.5s)]
*  Towards the end of 2023 is when we really started to see spending, even on a per customer level and across most income groups, kind of stabilize, flatten on a year on year basis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=177.5s)]
*  And that's on a notional basis. So it doesn't mean that inflation adjusted. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=188.5s)]
*  Real spend has been declining slightly over the past few months. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=192.5s)]
*  And when you break that down even further, you look at sectors, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=197.5s)]
*  You look at what's happening in retail spending versus T&E versus groceries, et cetera, and dining. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=200.5s)]
*  And there isn't a big difference between what we would call discretionary spending and non-discretionary spending. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=207.5s)]
*  And that's really what you would normally start to see when people are becoming very, very cautious. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=213.5s)]
*  And so the reality of it is retail spending is down a little bit year on year. It was very solid during the holiday season. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=219.5s)]
*  It's down slightly. Within that, of course, there are some signs of where is it down? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=226.5s)]
*  It's down in department stores. It's down at electronic stores. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=231.5s)]
*  It's down sort of in home goods stores because everybody has pretty much fixed everything they wanted to fix in their homes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=235.5s)]
*  So there are areas where they're down. There are areas of slight declines in dining out, for example, offset by increase in groceries. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=241.5s)]
*  So you do see at the margin customers adapting and adjusting their spending, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=250.5s)]
*  but there's no real inflectionary point that we're seeing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=256.5s)]
*  And that's, of course, what we're monitoring. And we continue to look for any little cracks in the system. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=262.5s)]
*  So do we have like another summer of like the Taylor Swift economy of people outspending on entertainment? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=268.5s)]
*  I think it's stabilized. So the spending on travel and entertainment has been steady, but it's no longer really growing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=274.5s)]
*  And that's one of the areas that certainly last year was was pretty strong. But at this point, we would characterize it as steady. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=282.5s)]
*  What about is there any difference in the small business picture of any of that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=288.5s)]
*  You know, small businesses, interestingly, have even healthier cash buffers than consumers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=291.5s)]
*  So on a relative to 2019, the pandemic level, small businesses still have a little more cash buffers than consumers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=298.5s)]
*  Their spending, though, is declining a little bit as their margins are compressing between just really primarily the cost of labor and cost of wage inflation compressing their margins. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=305.5s)]
*  We look at, you know, we serve very small businesses. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=315.5s)]
*  So everybody who's sort of an S Corp, as you just heard earlier, and, you know, our small businesses taper out at around 20 million in revenue. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=318.5s)]
*  So we kind of serve a pretty wide scale. The smallest businesses have normalized, including in their delinquency levels on loan. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=327.5s)]
*  So we do see that smaller businesses are kind of getting to that point of normalization. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=336.5s)]
*  Larger businesses, I mean, their line utilization on their lines of credit is still relatively low and delinquencies are well below pre pandemic level. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=341.5s)]
*  So a little more to go for sort of the larger end of small business. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=348.5s)]
*  So all that sounds reasonably stable, healthy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=352.5s)]
*  It does. I mean, again, it's at the end of the day, health of U.S. consumer really comes down to the health of the labor market and containing inflation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=356.5s)]
*  So while those two things are operating and certainly they're better than where we thought we would be a year ago, that's really closely what we're watching. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=365.5s)]
*  And any other sort of little inflection points have not yet changed that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=374.5s)]
*  So the big moment this year then will be right. Chair Powell said this morning that the Fed's on track to cut rates. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=380.5s)]
*  What's first? What's the JP Morgan House view right now on rates? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=387.5s)]
*  You know, we try to really plan for a wide range of scenarios. So I wouldn't say we have one house view. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=391.5s)]
*  And Jamie's over here. Everyone else is here. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=400.5s)]
*  Yes, and we try to navigate, make sure that we survive any catastrophic or like tail end scenarios and have done a lot of exercise on what if rates go to seven percent or eight percent. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=403.5s)]
*  And then you do the opposite. You know, you have your some of you might be operating with Fed stress test, but you know, you have the opposite scenarios of what if rates drop to zero. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=414.5s)]
*  So we really try to make sure that we have a strategy that works in both tail ends that we can survive those and kind of operate in the middle. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=422.5s)]
*  I mean, our planning and guidance usually really follows implied rates. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=431.5s)]
*  So we've been expecting a declining rate scenario and every now and then six cuts, four cuts, five cuts. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=437.5s)]
*  So we're kind of planning for all of them. We know what the impact is of every incremental rate cut. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=445.5s)]
*  At the end of the day, what it really means for us and planning for it is specifically in my side of the house is what's going to happen to retail deposits. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=449.5s)]
*  There are a significant source of liquidity for the firm. There are a significant source of our balance sheet funding. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=460.5s)]
*  And so far, our rate paid betas have been historically low. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=467.5s)]
*  So really trying to forecast that and what does that mean for the company has been what the finance function is most focused on, really, in any bank these days. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=474.5s)]
*  I mean, I feel like what happened in the last few years with that was not at all what anyone expected. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=483.5s)]
*  So how are you forecasting when it's all? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=489.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, the hardest parts to forecast, especially when you're trying to do deposit forecasting, was the huge influx of liquidity from the fiscal stimulus that consumers receive and small businesses receive. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=493.5s)]
*  And that's why we've been monitoring. I think we had expected the declines over and the spend down of those excess deposits. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=506.5s)]
*  And as those have really started to materialize, I think we're better at calibrating what we're expecting in terms of deposit growth. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=516.5s)]
*  But, you know, candidly, we at Chase still expect retail deposits to be slightly down from here until lower rates really start to take hold. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=523.5s)]
*  And from what we've seen, that's really primarily due to consumers spending more so than customers moving their deposits to higher yield seeking alternatives, including money funds and online savings and every other options. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=532.5s)]
*  So this weekend marks the one year anniversary of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which was customers running away. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=547.5s)]
*  I'm sure you had a crazy weekend that weekend. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=555.5s)]
*  We did have a crazy weekend that weekend and a very crazy next month and a half or two months, I should say. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=557.5s)]
*  Right, right. So right. A little over a month later, you guys bought First Republic. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=562.5s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about how that's been going and what are you learning? What do you see from integrating First Republic? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=566.5s)]
*  Yes, I mean, look, the acquisition of First Republic for us is not how you would usually do an acquisition, right? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=573.5s)]
*  It was a very quick due diligence. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=579.5s)]
*  We really didn't have access to most of their data except for that very short due diligence weekend. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=583.5s)]
*  I actually remember I was flying back from India during that weekend and landed on Saturday, headed straight to the office. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=589.5s)]
*  So all of that is to say we had limited information about what exactly we were buying. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=596.5s)]
*  We did our best and obviously we had a lot of fairly conservative estimates to compensate for all of the uncertainty. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=602.5s)]
*  You know, overall, the integration is going well. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=608.5s)]
*  We expect to be materially done with integrating the franchise in the middle of this summer. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=610.5s)]
*  The big, of course, conversion that has to happen is the deposit systems and the branches. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=618.5s)]
*  They're still First Republic branches. For that reason, they're operating on First Republic systems. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=623.5s)]
*  So that should happen this summer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=628.5s)]
*  In terms of what we've seen from a and I should say we've already converted the mortgage portfolio, which was really one of the big assets we acquired. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=631.5s)]
*  I think in terms of what we're seeing, we're pleased with customer retention. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=640.5s)]
*  Many customers, as you would expect, you know, really took out a lot of their deposits in March and April, kind of leading up to that acquisition. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=645.5s)]
*  But from their deposits have really stabilized. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=653.5s)]
*  We've retained the vast majority of customers. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=656.5s)]
*  Of course, many customers had already moved some of their money to Chase and JP Morgan. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=658.5s)]
*  So we benefited from that during March and April. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=664.5s)]
*  And we've seen a little bit of deposit growth since then. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=667.5s)]
*  I think what we're really trying to figure out as we are working through the conversion is, you know, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=670.5s)]
*  how do we take some of the things that First Republic was really known for? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=678.5s)]
*  And some of you may have been customers is really, you know, that white glove personalized service, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=682.5s)]
*  but offer it in a controlled and scalable way that is expected of somebody the size of JP Morgan. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=688.5s)]
*  And how do we scale that beyond just the relatively small footprint of First Republic? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=696.5s)]
*  I mean, in the grand scheme of things, you know, we only acquired 80 branches and we have 4800. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=703.5s)]
*  So like the relative scale of what we acquired from a retail banking, after one banking standpoint is pretty small. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=710.5s)]
*  But we are really trying to gain that insight of customers love them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=717.5s)]
*  They really gave them a much bigger share of wallet. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=721.5s)]
*  And so we're trying to figure out how we translate that within our own franchise. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=725.5s)]
*  Have you figured out the cookies yet? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=728.5s)]
*  Chocolate chip cookies and umbrellas. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=730.5s)]
*  They were very much their trademark. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=732.5s)]
*  And so we're working on that. Stay tuned. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=734.5s)]
*  All right. I keep asking this question. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=736.5s)]
*  You will have to visit our new JP Morgan branch that will be opening in Columbus Circle. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=739.5s)]
*  I actually happen to live right around the corner from it, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=745.5s)]
*  but it will be one of the first two flagship branches that we are opening in a new format. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=748.5s)]
*  It will be branded JP Morgan. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=754.5s)]
*  And so that will be your first taste of whatever we serve there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=756.5s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=759.5s)]
*  Also, one year later, I'm just curious, what do you what do you guys think? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=763.5s)]
*  What do you feel about the state of the U.S. banking system right now? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=766.5s)]
*  We still got a couple of small banks struggling. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=769.5s)]
*  There's a whole question about the middle of the pack. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=771.5s)]
*  What's your view on how safe the system is right now? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=774.5s)]
*  I mean, look, obviously, having gone through that crisis a year ago, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=779.5s)]
*  completely understand the focus on it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=782.5s)]
*  And it is the right questions to ask. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=784.5s)]
*  Our house view at this point is that the couple of specific banks that are under focus [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=786.5s)]
*  are very much situational specific, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=793.5s)]
*  and it's really related to their specific exposure concentration. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=797.5s)]
*  So we don't think this is a broader systemic concern for the banking industry. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=801.5s)]
*  But all of that said, there are at least three things to really watch [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=805.5s)]
*  when it comes to the health of the banking system and regional banks in particular. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=809.5s)]
*  And those are, of course, liquidity, capital, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=815.5s)]
*  what happens in a higher for longer interest rate environment. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=818.5s)]
*  And especially with respect to capital, you know, Basel III is going to have more banks in scope. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=823.5s)]
*  And so we've been watching, and I think that's really the area of focus is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=830.5s)]
*  what we are seeing is banks in general have been building up capital, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=834.5s)]
*  building liquidity in preparation. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=838.5s)]
*  And it's just a matter of whether they're going to take it in one or two quarters [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=840.5s)]
*  or over a longer period of time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=844.5s)]
*  But we think it's manageable at this point, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=846.5s)]
*  so we wouldn't think what's happening right now is systemic. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=848.5s)]
*  Are they lending right now? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=852.5s)]
*  Like, is our audience able to walk into a bank and get a loan right now for the company? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=854.5s)]
*  Of course, there's still lending. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=858.5s)]
*  I mean, the key areas we are considering and thinking through [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=860.5s)]
*  when it comes through the different asset classes, right, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=864.5s)]
*  is Basel III in particular, besides credit risk, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=867.5s)]
*  it really has this very broad brush implication for operational risk capital. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=872.5s)]
*  And we can't ignore that. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=877.5s)]
*  And it is imposing operational risk capital even for lines of business and products [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=880.5s)]
*  that didn't historically have any significant operational losses. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=885.5s)]
*  So that's something that the industry is working through. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=890.5s)]
*  And of course, we have factored into our pricing sort of different expectations [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=892.5s)]
*  of future capital increases. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=896.5s)]
*  But we are still hopeful that the final rule will have some modifications. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=898.5s)]
*  But, you know, credit cards, if the rule passes as it is, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=903.5s)]
*  it would mean that we have to decrease credit lines. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=908.5s)]
*  It will mean that we will have to change some of the pricing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=912.5s)]
*  And we really need to focus on what is the right balance [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=915.5s)]
*  between customer impact and impact to the economy. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=918.5s)]
*  Same with auto, same with mortgage. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=922.5s)]
*  The gold plating that is in there just means there will be a little less credit [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=925.5s)]
*  at the margin and it will be more expensive. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=930.5s)]
*  So, yes, most customers, of course, can still do that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=932.5s)]
*  But at the margin, of course, we have to adapt. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=935.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=937.5s)]
*  You touched on branches briefly, but let's talk about where Chase is investing, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=939.5s)]
*  which is branches. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=944.5s)]
*  So you're building 500 branches, you've announced, which is not a small amount. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=946.5s)]
*  That's more than most banks have. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=950.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=952.5s)]
*  Putting you at like around 5,000, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=953.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=955.5s)]
*  What's, why, why branches? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=956.5s)]
*  So why branches? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=958.5s)]
*  And I know you gave this some really good coverage a couple of weeks ago, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=960.5s)]
*  but for those of you who may not have read his article, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=963.5s)]
*  we did announce 500 new branches over the next three years. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=966.5s)]
*  And that's on the back end of having already built 800 new branches [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=970.5s)]
*  over the past five years. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=975.5s)]
*  So it's a big continuation of an existing strategy. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=977.5s)]
*  And I think we've been pretty clear that it is different and distinguishes us [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=981.5s)]
*  from how our competitors think about the banking industry, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=986.5s)]
*  although I will say, you know, over the last couple of years, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=989.5s)]
*  some competitors have announced similar plans on a much, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=992.5s)]
*  much smaller scale than what we're doing. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=996.5s)]
*  Why do we love branches? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=999.5s)]
*  It's a very, very simple answer to that question in the sense [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1000.5s)]
*  that our customers love branches. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1003.5s)]
*  And so we follow a strategy that meets our customers' demands. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1005.5s)]
*  Now, do our customers love branches for the same reasons that they used them [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1010.5s)]
*  five or six or seven years ago? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1013.5s)]
*  No. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1015.5s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1016.5s)]
*  They used to come a lot to the branches for basic transactions, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1017.5s)]
*  and now they can do those in the mobile app. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1020.5s)]
*  They do those on the phone. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1022.5s)]
*  But customers still want to come and talk to a human being [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1024.5s)]
*  when they want to talk about a big amount of money they want to put into the bank, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1028.5s)]
*  when they want to talk about retirement, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1033.5s)]
*  when they want to talk about taking out the mortgage. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1036.5s)]
*  So there are just life moments and bigger financial decisions [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1038.5s)]
*  that are just much more comfortable when you are sitting across from a human. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1042.5s)]
*  And to give you a sense for, you know, the data we continue to look at, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1046.5s)]
*  I mean, nearly a million customers still go into our branches every single day. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1050.5s)]
*  And so, yes, they do things, they do different things when they walk in, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1055.5s)]
*  but those are a million people that we are servicing and serving [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1059.5s)]
*  and giving advice to across the entire income spectrum, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1064.5s)]
*  across various aspects of their financial lives. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1068.5s)]
*  And I should say a Chase branch isn't just a representation of our Chase footprint, really, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1071.5s)]
*  or our Chase products. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1077.5s)]
*  Many people wouldn't think about the fact that even though you can very easily apply [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1078.5s)]
*  for any Chase credit card online, a million credit cards, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1083.5s)]
*  a million Chase credit cards get opened in Chase branches every year. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1087.5s)]
*  So that's just a significant illustration of why we still continue to watch [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1092.5s)]
*  where our customers are leading us. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1100.5s)]
*  And it's the same truth about deposits. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1102.5s)]
*  I mean, you go open a checking account, if you opened it in the branch, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1104.5s)]
*  you're likely to put six times more money into it than if you opened it in digital. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1107.5s)]
*  So we think they're here to stay. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1112.5s)]
*  We think we have, you know, a really good, predictable, measurable strategy. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1114.5s)]
*  We look at it obsessively. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1119.5s)]
*  We are the only bank in the lower 48 states, and we have a long way to go. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1121.5s)]
*  I didn't mention upfront one other thing that I found very interesting when... [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1126.5s)]
*  I didn't grow up in the U.S., I should say. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1131.5s)]
*  And so when I started learning about the American retail banking system, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1134.5s)]
*  one of the things you find really fascinating is you look at the 50 biggest deposit markets in the U.S., [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1139.5s)]
*  and we all think about the top three large banks, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1144.5s)]
*  but in 19 of the 50 states, 50 biggest markets, not states, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1147.5s)]
*  in 19 of the 50 biggest deposit markets, the top bank is a local or regional bank [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1151.5s)]
*  that many of you probably never heard of, and that's what makes banking local. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1157.5s)]
*  And so you can't change that by having an uber-national, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1162.5s)]
*  very concentrated East Coast, West Coast strategy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1166.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting way to compete, too, right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1170.5s)]
*  So you have to go figure out how to beat the local market, the local leader in the market. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1173.5s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1178.5s)]
*  I do want to come to questions in a minute, but one more question on branches. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1180.5s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about how you look at them financially. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1183.5s)]
*  What do you watch to see, like, hey, this is a good branch, this is one that isn't so good. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1186.5s)]
*  This is why we're doing this. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1190.5s)]
*  Of course. So, I mean, yes, primarily branches are a marketing sales storefront, right? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1192.5s)]
*  And so the most important metrics we look at are we're deploying a lot of capital up front. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1200.5s)]
*  You're building it. You're signing a long lease, et cetera. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1206.5s)]
*  You're hiring a lot of people up front. So you're deploying a lot of capital up front. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1209.5s)]
*  When does that pay back? When does that break even, first and foremost? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1212.5s)]
*  And our break even is less than four years, and that's pretty predictable for us. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1217.5s)]
*  And then when does it pay back and when does it reach its kind of ultimate sort of mature value as a branch? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1221.5s)]
*  And that mature value continues to increase over time. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1228.5s)]
*  But, yeah, we look at that present value of a branch, and it's not just including deposits, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1231.5s)]
*  but including all of the investments referrals that those branches are going to make, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1235.5s)]
*  including the credit cards that we are going to refer, including the mortgages we're going to refer to. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1239.5s)]
*  So it's really a basic cash flow model. Many of you finance folks know how to do that, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1244.5s)]
*  but that's really what we look at, and we look at it for every single branch. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1252.5s)]
*  So we have a very specific model that looks at that particular zip code, that particular corner, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1256.5s)]
*  and based on all of our history of having opened so many hundreds of branches [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1262.5s)]
*  and all of the data that we have about local debit cards spending, local credit cards spending, local merchants, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1266.5s)]
*  everything we know about how many credit card customers do we already have near that branch, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1273.5s)]
*  that's how we kind of model it, and then we go back and stress test it, and of course they range. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1278.5s)]
*  Will that change with the next 500 versus the last 800? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1283.5s)]
*  You know, I think the next 500 versus the first 800 is a little bit less of the main factor, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1287.5s)]
*  and it's more, because to give you a sense, the next 500 is going to be kind of in two or three big buckets, I would say. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1293.5s)]
*  Many of them are going to be in the states that we just entered in the last four years, right? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1299.5s)]
*  So before we started this expansion in 2018, we used to be in 23 states. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1306.5s)]
*  We entered 25 states for the first time, so we have many, many markets where we have 2, 3% branch share. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1311.5s)]
*  That's not good enough in terms of really getting the best bank for the buck, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1319.5s)]
*  and there's a real sort of S-curve as you think about branch deposits, and so you need to get to... [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1324.5s)]
*  Sweet Spot is around 10% branch share, but between 5 and 10% branch share is where a lot of our branches are going to be [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1330.5s)]
*  filling in the markets where we just started. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1337.5s)]
*  We're farther ahead in D.C., which is where we started five, six years ago, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1341.5s)]
*  and we are way behind in some of the markets that we just entered last year. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1345.5s)]
*  So a lot of it is going to be there. A lot of them are kind of building out the suburbs around D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1350.5s)]
*  and then yes, we continue to have opportunities in some of our more mature markets, but those are much fewer. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1358.5s)]
*  So it's really more dependent on every single branch has its own DNA. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1363.5s)]
*  Does anyone have any questions? We can run mics around. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1368.5s)]
*  Got one in the middle here. She's over on your... [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1373.5s)]
*  Yes, hi. Adam Barsky. I'm a CFO from New York Power Authority. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1378.5s)]
*  Just we're going back to the health of the banking system, and I want to get your view of what you're seeing [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1384.5s)]
*  with regard to the commercial real estate mortgage space where you read about a lot of these things have to reprice or roll over. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1392.5s)]
*  People giving the keys back, all of these issues. How do you see that playing out? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1402.5s)]
*  Do you see it as another shoe dropping, or do you think there's capital to... enough capital whether that's stormed? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1409.5s)]
*  Yeah, great question, and I would just preface it with sort of in my side of the business, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1415.5s)]
*  we're primarily covering single family and very little really on the commercial side. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1420.5s)]
*  But all of that said, of course, even on the single family side of the business, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1426.5s)]
*  look, the good news is a lot of consumers did lock in, especially on the consumer side, right? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1431.5s)]
*  They locked in very low rates for 30 years, and so that we find that that cliff is still a ways out even for the arms that many people had signed up for. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1436.5s)]
*  So on the consumer side, we're pretty stable on that front. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1447.5s)]
*  Of course, on the commercial side, I was just talking about small businesses. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1451.5s)]
*  For example, most small business loans are also fixed terms. So for owner occupied real estate, those types of things, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1454.5s)]
*  those refinance waves will start closer to 26, 27, 28. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1463.5s)]
*  So there is definitely some period of time before some of that refinancing will come. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1467.5s)]
*  And that's really dependent on what the rate environment will be at that time. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1473.5s)]
*  From a multifamily perspective, at JPMorgan, our portfolio is very, very different than I think many of the competitors that we're watching right now, much less concentrated. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1478.5s)]
*  But yeah, no, there's definitely trouble in certain areas. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1489.5s)]
*  And that's where I go back to it's not unexpected. It's not unanticipated. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1493.5s)]
*  And I think overall the sector has been building up both reserves for that as well as capital to deal with it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1499.5s)]
*  So hopefully anything we'll see is going to be weathered well and a little bit more just a couple of players around the margin. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TDFX1pB6o&t=1506.5s)]
