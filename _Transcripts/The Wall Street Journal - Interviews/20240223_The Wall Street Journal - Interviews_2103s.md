# Behind Gene Editing’s Big Moment with Sickle-Cell Treatment | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU)
*  Jeff, the $2 million price tag is based on the idea that it's one and done for the rest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=0.0s)]
*  of your life, and that's going to save the health care system money. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=7.12s)]
*  What if it doesn't last for the rest of your life? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Is Vertex open to giving people rebates? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=13.32s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=16.0s)]
*  So let's just talk a little bit about what the data has taught us so far in terms of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=18.72s)]
*  the longevity. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=21.68s)]
*  We have patients, as you know, out more than four years now with a long-term effect that's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=22.68s)]
*  very, very stable. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  So I think that's sort of number one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=29.88s)]
*  The other thing that's obviously remarkable about this new generation of therapies is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=31.96s)]
*  that it is a one and done. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=35.76s)]
*  In other words, I think we treated 100 patients or so, Sam, in the Phase III trial, and of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=36.76s)]
*  those, 97% of the sickle cell patients were completely free of symptoms and 92% of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=42.48s)]
*  beta-thal patients were free from transfusion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=49.2s)]
*  So it is truly a life-altering, essentially curative kind of therapy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=51.3s)]
*  So with respect to price, obviously it's always a difficult one to set the price on these. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=56.16s)]
*  And this one was a little easier for two reasons. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=61.32s)]
*  One, this is a very expensive therapy to manufacture, very complicated since you have to take the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=63.48s)]
*  patient's cells out, edit them, put them back in, and there's a hospital procedure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=68.72s)]
*  But the other one was there's a very strong health economic argument for this particular [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=74.0s)]
*  disease. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=77.56s)]
*  There's well-documented evidence that for the average sickle cell patient, the lifelong [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=78.72s)]
*  cost of treatment is somewhere between $4 and $6.5 million. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=83.56s)]
*  And so if you actually do have a therapy that can take care of that, obviously at $2 million, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=87.6s)]
*  that's a tremendous savings to the health care system. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=93.0s)]
*  And so far we're seeing payers being very, very receptive to that, both at the government [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=95.36s)]
*  side and on the private paying side. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=99.88s)]
*  I think there's an acceptance that it's a good deal as well as a good therapy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=101.6s)]
*  They're not asking to give payments and not up front to break it up? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=105.72s)]
*  No, in fact, the opposite. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  So we went out and had some discussions beforehand. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  Sam will remember this about different payment models because we weren't sure what they were [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=115.84s)]
*  going to prefer. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  And universally, they prefer the upfront payment model as long as we were seeing these long [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  term effects. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  And Sam, I mean, how can these therapies help people with ultra, ultra rare diseases if [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  $2 million is kind of like the starting point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  If you have even fewer patients, the price is probably going to be even higher. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=137.52s)]
*  So will CRISPR be available for patients that have ultra rare diseases? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=141.4s)]
*  Yeah. First of all, I just want to say that, you know, having this drug, Casgevia, approved [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=146.56s)]
*  just 10 years after the elucidation of the platform is just remarkable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=152.56s)]
*  I think people talk about singularity and how, you know, machines become smarter than [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=157.52s)]
*  humans. But, you know, the fact that we as humans can edit our own genome to make ourselves [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=161.08s)]
*  better is a very important moment in the history of mankind. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=165.6s)]
*  And, you know, while we're celebrating that approval, I think it's, you know, I concur [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=170.56s)]
*  with everything Jeff said, which is, you know, the vertex has been so responsible in thinking [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=175.92s)]
*  about the price. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=179.56s)]
*  And it's not based on, well, here's the number of patients and here's how much money we need [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  to make. It's based on what value we're adding to the system. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=184.04s)]
*  And even the pharmacoeconomic lens, in the case of sickle cell, tells you that this price [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=187.44s)]
*  that we've used is actually going to create a lot of value for the system. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=192.64s)]
*  Hence, there's no pushback from payers and they welcome this responsible approach. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  So that doesn't mean that, you know, there's solutions for ultra ultra therapies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=201.24s)]
*  We say, oh, wait, one tenth the number of patients. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=205.56s)]
*  So the cost should be 10 times more. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  That is not at all how we're looking at it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=210.48s)]
*  In fact, we are going after both common diseases and rare diseases. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=212.52s)]
*  And in each case, we're going to apply that same lens, which is what is the benefit that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=216.36s)]
*  we're bringing to patients? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=220.32s)]
*  What is the value to the system? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=222.24s)]
*  And my prediction long term is that as we get to this new paradigm of medicine, of one [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=224.48s)]
*  and done and durable treatments, you actually will save the system money and make it more [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=230.2s)]
*  sustainable to bring medicines to more patients in need. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=236.0s)]
*  And Amy, the other thing is the technology is advancing, as you said. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=240.4s)]
*  I mean, we aren't sitting on our laurels. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  Sam and I are working hard together to make this faster, better and less expensive to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=244.4s)]
*  produce. And as we do that, we can both increase access and hopefully reduce price. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=249.4s)]
*  How long will it take to get a cheaper crisper? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=254.08s)]
*  It won't be a single thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=257.44s)]
*  But, you know, one of the things that Sam and I are working hard on together is today [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=259.04s)]
*  you have to have a fairly significant bone marrow ablation protocol before you get the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=262.88s)]
*  cells back. And then you need to be in the hospital for a while. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=267.4s)]
*  That's one of the reasons it takes so long and so expensive. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=270.0s)]
*  If we could make a gentler conditioning regimen so that this could be done essentially as [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=272.6s)]
*  an outpatient or done with a couple of days in the hospital, it would be a game changer, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=276.88s)]
*  both in terms of the number of patients that would have access to the drug, but potentially [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=280.92s)]
*  also the price. And we're I think we're making good progress. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  We're not there, but we're not going to stop till we get there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=286.92s)]
*  Yes. Sam, you talked about the potential for doing the gene editing inside the body, even [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=289.88s)]
*  for a later version of of Keshavie. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=294.6s)]
*  Where like where are you with inside the body gene editing not having to do it outside, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=297.68s)]
*  which increases the cost? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=302.64s)]
*  Well, that's something, you know, Jeff, you'll recall we talked about this years ago, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  which is you think about, you know, Africa and how we get to patients in Africa. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  Eventually we have to have something that's potentially in vivo because, you know, the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=313.24s)]
*  hospital systems, the infrastructure to do something that's an ex vivo cell therapy, it's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=317.92s)]
*  just not there. If you go to Botswana or Kenya, there's maybe one center that can that can do [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=322.04s)]
*  it, but not again. They're not qualified. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=327.12s)]
*  So what is the next wave is in vivo editing, which is not that easy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  It's complex biology. We're working on it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=334.32s)]
*  We have a grant from the Gates Foundation, you know, where Texas is also working on it in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  parallel. It's sort of like electric vehicles. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=340.0s)]
*  You know, when the Tesla came out, the models were more expensive and everyone asked the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=342.92s)]
*  question, how is this going to get less expensive? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=347.12s)]
*  And even before that was Fisker Karma. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=349.72s)]
*  But now you see EV vehicles that are much lower cost because technology enables lower [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=351.76s)]
*  costs with scale and improvement in sort of the supply infrastructure and everything else. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=358.48s)]
*  So I my prediction is I think it's hard to say when is there going to be less expensive [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=363.44s)]
*  CRISPR, because that's a very hard question. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=369.24s)]
*  You know, in the case of oncology or alginate CAR-T's, it may come sooner than you anticipate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=370.88s)]
*  But for some rare diseases, it may take a little longer because there's complex biology to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=376.4s)]
*  deal with. But the refreshing thing here is the companies that are the vanguard of this new [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=380.6s)]
*  wave like Vertex, maybe Regeneron, you know, we're not shackled with the old pharma mindset [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=386.68s)]
*  around pricing and how you think about profits. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  And so we're able to think independently and say what makes sense in the context of the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=394.36s)]
*  disease in the system. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=398.48s)]
*  I I know that there are a lot of disparities with countries outside the United States, but [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=400.32s)]
*  even inside the United States, many of the 16000 sickle cell patients in this country are on [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=406.0s)]
*  Medicaid. So what's going to happen? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=412.56s)]
*  I mean, there is a proposal for Medicaid, you know, reimbursing, but they want to do it based [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  on outcomes, not, you know, not upfront. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=420.8s)]
*  Where does Vertex, for instance, stand on that kind of proposal? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=423.8s)]
*  Yeah, we've been working on this, obviously, for a long time, even before the before the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=427.04s)]
*  approval. And I think we've made great progress. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=431.12s)]
*  If you think about the numbers in the U.S., about 100000 sickle cell patients, we think about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  25000 or so of those are severe enough to be amenable to this therapy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=437.76s)]
*  So start with 25000. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=443.16s)]
*  A lot of them are on Medicaid. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=445.04s)]
*  Today, we have 60 percent of those patients on Medicaid covered already and 25 percent more [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=446.76s)]
*  that we think were just weeks to months away. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=453.08s)]
*  So within a very short period of time, we'll have 90 percent of those patients covered on [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=454.88s)]
*  Medicaid. And again, what we're seeing is we go you have to go state by state. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=458.36s)]
*  Obviously, what we're seeing as we go to each state is it's a very simple education process. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=461.92s)]
*  When you show them the benefit and you show them the cost savings to the system, we're just not [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=466.72s)]
*  getting a lot of pushback. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=471.08s)]
*  And what about uptake? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=472.92s)]
*  What are some of the concerns that patient groups have have raised about uptake? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=474.76s)]
*  There have been concerns raised by the patient advocacy group. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  I think the biggest concern we're hearing, Amy, is the procedure is so complex that people [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  have to take a few weeks or months off work. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  They often have to travel because only specialized centers can do this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=488.68s)]
*  And then a third feature that's very important to patients and to us is preservation of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  fertility. And so we again have been working on that very hard for these patients. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=495.88s)]
*  We have permission from HHS to help patients with their travel expenses, their lodging [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=500.20000000000005s)]
*  expenses. We can get them to the center. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  So I think we've more or less solved that problem. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=507.16s)]
*  We're still discussing the fertility problem because there's a very complex set of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=509.88000000000005s)]
*  regulations around that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=513.6s)]
*  But I think we're making progress. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=515.08s)]
*  And if you ask me, I think we'll solve that problem in the next three to six months and be able [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=516.32s)]
*  to help patients with their fertility preservation. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=519.64s)]
*  I was thinking about that because, you know, in cancer care, for example, chemotherapy [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=521.88s)]
*  regimens can also damage your fertility. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=526.16s)]
*  But drug makers aren't covering egg banking for cancer patients. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=528.36s)]
*  Why does why did Vertex get involved with that kind of program? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=532.16s)]
*  Well, sort of like Sam said, I think Vertex and CRISPR have a common culture, which is quite [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  different from what you might call drugmaker culture. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, when we got into this, I remember Sam and I were told by lots of folks on Wall [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=543.7199999999999s)]
*  Street and elsewhere like, why are you doing this disease where you can't really make any [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  money and it's a difficult population to treat, etc., etc. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=550.56s)]
*  And our answer was because we now have the technology to actually cure this disease that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=553.84s)]
*  hasn't been treated well for 60 years. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=557.36s)]
*  And we're going to do that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=559.2s)]
*  And it's the same for these sorts of things. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=561.0s)]
*  I mean, Vertex has a long history of making sure that every patient has access to our [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=562.52s)]
*  medicines, regardless of their zip code or their ability to pay, and also that we can help [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=567.36s)]
*  them out with some of the other costs, which are sort of the hidden costs of getting these [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  therapies. And that's a cultural similarity, I think, between us and CRISPR. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=574.76s)]
*  But you are going to make money. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=578.72s)]
*  We hope we'll make money eventually. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=580.76s)]
*  I mean, that is you are a business, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=582.2s)]
*  Your culture is making money. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=585.44s)]
*  If I may add something, Amy, on the question on the fertility, which is, you know, I don't [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=587.2s)]
*  know how many in the audience here have actually met with some of the patients that have sickle [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  cell. And time is of the essence. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=595.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think early days we're working with a patient advocacy group and there was one [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=598.96s)]
*  person was a patient advocate who was 32 years old, you know, pretty fit, would go to the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=603.48s)]
*  gym all time and one day just died, you know, because he had a stroke. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's the thing about sickle cell is there's like this sword hanging on your head. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=612.12s)]
*  And not to mention the chronic pain and everything else. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=617.2s)]
*  So, yes, there are a lot of challenges, you know, in terms of hospitals having to increase [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=619.4000000000001s)]
*  capacity, which, by the way, is not a big challenge. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  I think people write about it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=626.84s)]
*  We have to solve the fertility equation. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=628.36s)]
*  But, you know, many cases, I think patients will say, look, I cannot live with this disease [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  anymore. I need a drug. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=635.96s)]
*  I need a therapy tomorrow. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=637.36s)]
*  I cannot wait. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=638.84s)]
*  And that's why we did we acted with such urgency in the clinical trials through COVID, you [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=639.96s)]
*  know, in the pandemic time frame. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  It was very hard to have patients in the hospital because hospitals were overrun. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  Even in that time frame, we made sure we were a pedal to the metal in getting patients this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  therapy so that they have an option when this disease is, you know, in many cases could be [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  deadly for them. So I think that just to put all this in context, right, there's, you know, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=662.52s)]
*  since this is the first approved therapy in sickle cell, everybody's writing about an [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=667.2800000000001s)]
*  angle. There's an article about fertility or angle about hospital capacity. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=671.24s)]
*  But the reality is there's a great unmet need for the first disease that was discovered [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  as a molecular disease in Chicago where you were practicing. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=680.96s)]
*  And we had no solution for 70 years. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=686.32s)]
*  You know, that's the bigger picture, I think, that will allow this to, you know, be have a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=689.76s)]
*  greater uptake than most people imagine. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  One of the strange things that happens in this disease, and we saw in CF too, is when you [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=698.12s)]
*  really get to know the patients and these disease, you get to know the patients when you're [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=702.48s)]
*  developing these therapies. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=705.4s)]
*  And one of the things you realize is this complete shift in their outlook on life. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=707.48s)]
*  So our CF patients before therapy, they weren't thinking about having children. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=712.12s)]
*  They weren't thinking about working and they were not thinking about living to be 60 or 70 [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=715.76s)]
*  years old until we had a therapy that essentially cured them. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=719.0s)]
*  And suddenly now they want to get pregnant. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  They want to go back to work. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=723.72s)]
*  They want to have a normal life. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  And we're starting to see the same kinds of things here, that patients who had no hope [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=726.12s)]
*  about really a future life are beginning to think about that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=730.2399999999999s)]
*  And that's a remarkable thing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=733.52s)]
*  How many years out do you think a patient needs to be without an episode to say I'm cured? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. That's a tough question. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=742.0s)]
*  I tell you my belief. It's a belief and we need to demonstrate this. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=743.4799999999999s)]
*  But everything we know about the technology says once you do an edit like this, it's there for [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  life because it's in the DNA and that DNA is there in those cells for life. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=751.68s)]
*  And these clones seem to be quite, quite stable. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  So everything we're seeing so far says that's true in lots of patients, not in 20 percent of the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=757.4s)]
*  patients or 30 percent. But the proof is in the pudding. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think when we start to get out seven or 10 years each year, our confidence will go up. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=764.88s)]
*  And the other thing I'll add, which is, you know, this question comes up a lot because in many [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=770.4799999999999s)]
*  cases, those who are not deep in the technology, it's like once bitten twice shy in gene therapies, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=775.56s)]
*  traditional gene therapies which use AVs, they're not integrating into the genome. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=780.16s)]
*  They're sitting there in the nucleus, but they don't replicate. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=785.28s)]
*  Right. So when cells replicate, you dilute the number of, you know, vehicles carrying the gene that [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  you want to put in the patient. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=793.7199999999999s)]
*  And so you do have a major durability question. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=795.68s)]
*  So in the case of some of the gene therapies, three, four years out, you started losing [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=798.04s)]
*  durability. So the question people ask is, is that same thing going to happen in gene editing? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  And the answer is no, because here you're actually editing the genome which replicates as cells [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  replicate. And so it's a permanent thing. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=811.4s)]
*  And in fact, I would say again, you know, maybe as a small biotech, we make these arguments. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=813.88s)]
*  We were saying that if you see durability for six months, that's a signal durability for life. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, obviously, with the regulators, we have to settle on a much longer time frame of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=824.76s)]
*  observation. But the fundamentals indicate that durability can be seen very quickly. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=828.08s)]
*  How young do you want to go for getting gene edited? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=834.28s)]
*  I mean, you said that the advantage is to try to edit before you've had so much damage. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=836.92s)]
*  So do you want to be a kindergartner and get gene edited? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  Great question. And we face this question in CF for many, many years. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=847.56s)]
*  And obviously, the responsible way to do this and the way that we've done it is you start with the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=850.8s)]
*  older patients. And today, as you know, we're approved for patients 12 and older. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=854.4s)]
*  But there is no doubt in my mind that we want to go younger. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=857.8s)]
*  In CF, we're treating patients who are six months old now with our medicines. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=860.84s)]
*  And so far, they're not getting the disease. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=864.32s)]
*  And that's the goal here, right? Because the damage that you have before you're edited [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=866.12s)]
*  doesn't necessarily go away. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=869.84s)]
*  So the goal is do the editing as early as possible so you don't have the heart attacks and the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=871.6s)]
*  strokes and the kidney damage. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=875.16s)]
*  And then you don't have the symptoms of the long term sequelae of the disease. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  So was there animal data in like, you know, animals that are comparable to the age of a [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=880.72s)]
*  young child? The way there was with adults. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=885.88s)]
*  That's why you felt confident to go forward and get such young children. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=888.12s)]
*  Yes. So today, as you know, we're treating five to 11 year olds in our clinical trials and that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=891.08s)]
*  trial, I think Sam is now fully enrolled. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=894.84s)]
*  So we will see those data soon. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=896.6s)]
*  And my prediction is actually those kids will do even better because they're younger and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=898.44s)]
*  they're more resilient and they're better with the treatment. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=902.12s)]
*  And then they won't develop the sequelae of the disease. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=904.44s)]
*  I know you're not doing gene editing of embryos, but should we? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=907.08s)]
*  I mean, then you wouldn't need to take any medicine. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm having a start, which is my answer until about three, four months ago is absolutely not. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=914.76s)]
*  You know, where the technology is not there. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=922.92s)]
*  We're just not ready to take on something like this where you need to edit an embryo. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=924.6s)]
*  And why do you need to do that? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=928.88s)]
*  Because there's, you know, if you're doing IVF, you can select embryos that are normal. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=929.92s)]
*  You don't have to do it. And, you know, I get invited to all these ethical debates about whether we [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=934.16s)]
*  should do it or not. And then, you know, you hear some of these family stories. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=938.88s)]
*  You know, there's a story of a family that has, you know, they they have this carrier gene [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  fragile X, which is a which is a problem. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=948.8s)]
*  You don't want to have a child with that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=950.52s)]
*  And the problem is they couldn't produce any more embryos. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=952.24s)]
*  And they're faced with this choice of saying, do I take a risk of editing an embryo or do I do adoption or something [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=955.24s)]
*  else? And the question is, what's fair? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=960.52s)]
*  You know, it's not to me. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=962.8399999999999s)]
*  It's not such an easy answer on these topics. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=965.16s)]
*  My stance right now is CRISPR stances. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=968.52s)]
*  We're not going to touch embryo and embryonic gene editing because there are a lot of complications that we don't [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=970.4s)]
*  understand yet. You know, it's how do we get all these features develop from one cell and one embryo? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=975.7199999999999s)]
*  Because there's spatial issues of chromosomes inside the cells. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=981.0799999999999s)]
*  And there's so much more to understand. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  So I just don't think we're ready for it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=987.92s)]
*  It was our stance when the WHO had convened a meeting. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=990.0s)]
*  But, you know, from a ethical standpoint, is it a no forever? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=993.8800000000001s)]
*  I don't know, because there is still a need for many people like the story I told you where there's no other option. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=998.72s)]
*  Is that something Vertex would ever consider? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  I never say never, but we're not considering it today. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1007.7600000000001s)]
*  And one of the reasons is we're fortunate in the diseases we're going after, like sickle cell and beta-thal, that we don't [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1010.44s)]
*  need to do it. We will be able to treat very early. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think we will be able to do this without editing embryos. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1017.96s)]
*  And to Sam's point, I just think we need to understand a lot more about the dynamics of what happens when you edit [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1020.68s)]
*  embryos. How much uptake do you do you want to see with this drug before you declare it a success for from the company's [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1026.76s)]
*  perspective? So I hate to say this. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to mean this unerring, but I already declare it a success because we've already cured whatever, you know, a hundred [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  and some patients. And that's remarkable. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1043.0s)]
*  If you talk to those patients, you would feel like it's a success. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1044.76s)]
*  So I've already declared a success, but we want to make it available to as many of those hundred thousand patients as [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1047.6399999999999s)]
*  possible. And the first step will be this therapy. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1053.1999999999998s)]
*  But that's why we're so we have such urgency around getting these gentler conditioning regimens and in vivo, because then all [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1056.08s)]
*  the patients will be able to take it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1062.28s)]
*  That's that's always been our goal in every disease we treat. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1063.52s)]
*  One of the themes throughout the day has been that we have all these new ideas and new therapies, but a very, very old [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1066.56s)]
*  system. So it's not so old. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1074.6s)]
*  I didn't think, you know, heads of companies. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1078.6s)]
*  But, you know, Sam, you talked about this, but I'd love to hear a little bit more. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  What what changes does the system need to make to really fulfill kind of a CRISPR revolution? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1087.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I would say that I'm actually been surprised by how malleable the system already is. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1095.6s)]
*  You know, when we started out on Zephyr, we took our lumps in the early days, you know, with the regulators. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  We had some early meeting with payers and it didn't seem easy at all. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1109.1599999999999s)]
*  And to me, I was like, well, the you know, we need takes a village to make this happen. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1112.76s)]
*  We need the whole system to adapt to all this. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1116.8s)]
*  But what we found that in the last as people saw data and saw the power of the technology, we found that the regulators are [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1119.48s)]
*  leaning in a little bit to enable these therapies. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1127.56s)]
*  In fact, at the JP Morgan conference, Peter March made comments about how compared to gene therapies, CRISPR is that much more predictable and they think it's safer for patients. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1131.2s)]
*  So we found them leaning in, you know, the current administration leaning in with this initiative. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1141.48s)]
*  So I actually, you know, probably change my stance about how the system was not equipped at all for therapy like this. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1146.72s)]
*  And a lot of it's kudos to Vertex and the work they've done in educating the ecosystem, I would say, around how to think about a therapy that's different from the way we've thought about pills in the past. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1153.5600000000002s)]
*  It's about two things. It's education and early education. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1164.48s)]
*  We started this four or five years ago, long before we had approval. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  And then it's just the quality of the data. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1171.24s)]
*  This is these sorts of transformational therapies can move the system. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  And they have moved the system not only in this disease, but in multiple diseases. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1176.92s)]
*  Is it going to be possible to get access to this drug, though, in countries that have fewer resources, have fewer hospitals that are able to put a patient, you know, in the hospital for a long time while they're getting all these regimens? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1180.24s)]
*  You know, what do you see this in terms of uptake outside of the United States? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1194.52s)]
*  I think Sam said it really, really well. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1198.52s)]
*  Our goal is to get access to everybody. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  This technology today, it's going to be very difficult, both because of the cost of producing it, but even more so the lack of infrastructure. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1202.6s)]
*  In many of these countries, and you can't do a bone marrow transplant if you don't have a center that's done a lot of bone marrow transplants. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1209.64s)]
*  That wouldn't be ethical. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1214.8000000000002s)]
*  So right now, those are the two big big stumbling blocks. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1215.72s)]
*  But the hope is, as we get the technology better, as we go to gentler conditioning and then we go to in vivo therapy, that's going to open up the rest of the world. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1219.16s)]
*  That's the way to get there. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1226.2s)]
*  So really, we have to figure out the in the in inside the body editing. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1227.96s)]
*  That's do you think that's the biggest change? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1232.0s)]
*  That's one approach. You know, there are many approaches for all taking. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1235.0s)]
*  There's a target conditioning, I think, could be a major driver of that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1237.84s)]
*  If you can get that working, which may take a shorter amount of time versus in vivo gene editing, which has many more complexities around biology, but also of tissue editing, etc. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1242.0s)]
*  So but one thing I want to frame is, you know, when someone asked me the other day is like, oh, how long may it take for in vivo gene editing for sickle cell? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1253.76s)]
*  I say, you know, could be eight to 10 years and say, oh, my God, that's a very long time. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1261.1599999999999s)]
*  Let me remind you, this disease we've known about in the molecular base of over 70 years and pharma has done zilch in 70 years. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  And now we have a therapy that's approved. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  And now we're moving at breakneck speed to make this all happen. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1274.0400000000002s)]
*  The next gen with targeted conditioning and then in vivo within a decade. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1277.88s)]
*  I think that's pretty fast when you think about how complex treating these patients are. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1281.88s)]
*  So when we started this thing, I think I told you this when we started and say, I remember, you know, seven years ago, there was just tremendous. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1287.0400000000002s)]
*  Skepticism and sort of honestly, just people saying, don't do it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1294.2s)]
*  I mean, Wall Street said, don't do it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1298.24s)]
*  Regulators said, don't do it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1300.52s)]
*  It's going to be too hard. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1301.72s)]
*  It's going to take too long. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1302.48s)]
*  People inside the company, the founder of Vertex was vehemently opposed to us doing this, just said, it's going to take 20 years, 30 years. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1303.76s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1310.0s)]
*  It's too hard. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1310.92s)]
*  And yet, you know, you see what happens. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1312.1200000000001s)]
*  So I think one of the lessons here is when you see the technology and you know that it has the power and the potential to work, it's worth jumping on it even through all that opposition, because that opposition [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1314.2s)]
*  fades away as the results start to come. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1323.8s)]
*  But the 70 years that you that you were talking about that it took so long, you know, to sort of get something wasn't only because of science. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1326.04s)]
*  It also was because of disparities. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1335.04s)]
*  And sometimes drug companies don't focus on certain groups that have fewer resources or are underrepresented to sort of, you know, advocate for themselves. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1337.6s)]
*  Do you see that changing? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1347.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, we're trying to change that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1350.44s)]
*  I mean, that's that's the big, you know, interestingly, the early days of the deal with Vertex, you know, you had independently decided that sickle cell and thalassemia were indications you wanted to work on through your internal process. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1353.92s)]
*  For us, it made the most sense from a technology, you know, we already had technology risk, so we don't want to take a lot of biology risk. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1366.08s)]
*  We're like, let's find a disease where we know what the genetic change we need to make is, or we know what the cause of the disease is from a molecular basis. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  So two different reasons why we arrived at the same indications. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1380.64s)]
*  But, you know, there was this overhang of of disparity, not just in the health system, but among investors. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1384.44s)]
*  Investor skepticism often drives which way people go. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1391.48s)]
*  And luckily for us, we said, you know, it doesn't matter. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1394.8799999999999s)]
*  We'll show that technology works. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1398.08s)]
*  And we had the good fortune of being having the crisper halo so we could raise money. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1399.48s)]
*  But a lot of biotechs that would say, OK, if you have a small molecule or antibody that's not as sexy and you want to raise money to treat sickle cell disease, you were not going to be able to raise money. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1403.76s)]
*  And Vertex had obviously the advantage of saying, you know, you have a drug approved and you don't have to think about the shackles that we put on you. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1412.52s)]
*  So it's not just the system. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1421.8s)]
*  Investors also have a driving force in some of this. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1423.0s)]
*  But I think the fact that we've gotten to this point has changed the mindsets for many other companies. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1426.0s)]
*  I see a lot more companies taking risks now with diseases that were not in the frame of what investors were thinking about that previously wouldn't have happened. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1431.6s)]
*  Can you give an example that you think is representative of this change? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1440.0s)]
*  Think about some of these ultra rare diseases. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1444.76s)]
*  There's like GST 1A or SCID. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1446.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, some of these diseases where, you know, people will do the math and say there's not enough patients or, you know, this is going to cost a lot of money to do. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1449.32s)]
*  But now companies are saying, what if we buck the regulatory framework, not buck the regulatory framework, what if you help with the regulators change the way we think about a platform way of getting things approved where it's, you know, you get approved for one type of SCID. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1455.6399999999999s)]
*  It can be approved for other types of SCID. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1467.92s)]
*  You know, so novel ways of thinking about drug approval, how you spend against that drug approval. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1469.24s)]
*  And that'll change how people think about the return equation. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1475.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1477.84s)]
*  And I think people are starting to do that now. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  Whereas before you just had a dogmatic view and saying, you know what, I'm going to develop something for cancer because, you know, with cancer, you're going to get paid anyways. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1480.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, our pharma is going to buy you. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1487.6399999999999s)]
*  And that that is a refreshing thing that we're seeing across the ecosystem. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1489.36s)]
*  But you both are also working on common CRISPR for common diseases as well. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1494.1999999999998s)]
*  Is that more complicated when there's, you know, multiple factors that go into driving conditions, you know, heart disease or other kinds of your heart disease? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1498.32s)]
*  I think are nice. Yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1508.28s)]
*  You know, for us, one lens I took was, you know, we as a leader in the CRISPR space, we felt we also have the responsibility to say it's not just rare disease in the early days. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1509.8s)]
*  The framing was CRISPR. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's six thousand rare genetic diseases. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1522.1999999999998s)]
*  That's what CRISPR is going to do. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  And I said, OK, what is the biggest cause of mortality? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1526.8s)]
*  Heart disease, cancer and diabetes. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1529.28s)]
*  And we said, OK, let's think about is there a solution there that could be polygenic? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1531.6s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a single gene. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1536.84s)]
*  And so we're now doing these trials where we have a single injection against a known cardiovascular risk factor that could reduce your LDL cholesterol by 50 percent for life. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1538.48s)]
*  Now, again, all these questions emerge that you're asking, should we do it earlier? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1550.56s)]
*  Because the younger you do it, the better. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  Because once you already have damaged vessels or you have a lot of plaque forming there, you know, is it hard to reverse those things? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1555.76s)]
*  So we're going through the same challenges, the same skepticism by a lot of investors saying, you know, this this no one's going to do this. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1561.92s)]
*  Why would anyone do gene editing for a risk factor? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1569.0s)]
*  But but that's how you change the system in a way. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1572.28s)]
*  So that's our effort. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1576.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm a lot older than Sam. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1577.52s)]
*  So I lived through this probably three or four times in my career. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1579.48s)]
*  I literally remember the days when monoclonal antibodies were on the outs and anybody that was doing monoclonal antibodies was stupid and they were never really going to make it. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1582.48s)]
*  And the first ones failed. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1589.6000000000001s)]
*  I remember the days when RNA therapies were people said, that's not really a drug. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1590.72s)]
*  You'll never make it into a drug. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1594.76s)]
*  I remember the days in CF where people said, you'll never make a small molecule that can refold a protein. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1596.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just impossible. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1600.84s)]
*  And so a lot of this is just bucking the trends and being confident in the science and taking the science forward, at least in my life. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1601.92s)]
*  Every time we've done that, we've both done good for patients and the company has done very well. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1609.96s)]
*  You've mentioned age a few times during this conversation. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1614.2s)]
*  Any thoughts on CRISPR for anti-aging? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1618.04s)]
*  No, I wish I did. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1620.84s)]
*  I keep asking Sam, is there anything for baldness or anything for age? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1623.84s)]
*  And you keep saying no. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1626.6799999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you on anti-aging that there's all these conferences happening and there's two schools of thought. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  OK, there's one school of thought that says do a lot of preventive medicine like cholesterol reduction. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1634.2s)]
*  You take these CRISPR medicines and you're going to live longer disease free. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  The other school of thought is what if you just fix neurodegeneration, keep your brain intact, and then it's just a notion of replacing your organs. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1644.64s)]
*  And so the regenerative medicine approach, you know, so you create artificial kidneys. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1653.56s)]
*  People are doing, you know, edited artificial kidneys. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1659.28s)]
*  You know, but the first step in that regenerative medicine approach, which we're both doing, is towards diabetes. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1662.8s)]
*  You can actually find, create cells and engineer them to replace your pancreas. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1668.36s)]
*  And if we're able to achieve that, that does send us a big signal towards this school of thought. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1673.08s)]
*  The conferences that are going in this direction are going to make more money than the other one that's preventive medicine. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1679.28s)]
*  But we'll see. I do think that, you know, longevity is going to get impacted by all these medicines and we are going to live longer. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1684.4s)]
*  But the question is, you know, you don't want to just live longer. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1692.8400000000001s)]
*  You want to live healthier for longer. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1695.92s)]
*  That's the key, right? And the big differences in sickle cell and CF in diabetes is not only are you going to live longer, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1697.24s)]
*  the quality of life is just dramatically and instantly improved. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1702.88s)]
*  And that's you're not treating symptoms, you're not treating for life. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1706.68s)]
*  You're improving the quality of life right away. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1709.0800000000002s)]
*  Audience, I really want you to participate in this conversation, especially because of what my next question is going to be. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1711.5600000000002s)]
*  So after I ask this question, please get ready with your questions. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1717.64s)]
*  And that is CRISPR for all. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1720.76s)]
*  I mean, do you both this is already an inflection point just with this drug approval. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1723.76s)]
*  I mean, we already, you know, put that set that flag there right from the beginning. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1727.96s)]
*  But is every single one of us eventually going to get gene edited? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1732.28s)]
*  I'm like, we're all going to get CRISPR at some point in our lives. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1738.32s)]
*  I hope not. Sam, what do you think? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1740.88s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, this is a ethical question for society. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1744.08s)]
*  You know, CRISPR for enhancement, I'm not sure is the right thing. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1748.04s)]
*  You know, there's so much unmet need with diseases that we need to fix or people that don't have the have normal functioning, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  whether it's organs or whether it's debilitating conditions that prevent them from leading a normal life. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1759.64s)]
*  We have a lot of work ahead of us to do to solve that, to bring everybody towards the normal. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1766.44s)]
*  And, you know, the only way you think about CRISPR for all is CRISPR for all is some sort of enhancement that people are seeking. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1771.72s)]
*  And I don't know that we should go there yet. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1778.44s)]
*  I think, you know, I'm sure people think about it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1780.0s)]
*  You can't always control with the new technology like that. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1782.3600000000001s)]
*  But at this point, working on the first phase, which is disease amelioration, followed by a second phase where there's prevention, you know, editing for prevention. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1785.4s)]
*  And then we get to that third phase where we may contemplate these things. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1795.68s)]
*  But that's still, to me, at least a couple of decades away. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Are there questions from the audience? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1802.28s)]
*  OK, I see someone in the front here with a raised hand. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  Can you say your name and? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1811.92s)]
*  Hi. Yes, it's working. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  Hi, I'm Leslie Gordon, the parent of a child who had progeria and the co-founder of the Progeria Research Foundation. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1817.32s)]
*  And progeria is a premature aging disease and children die in their teens of heart disease. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1825.52s)]
*  And it's very tempting to be editable because it's caused by a single base change and 90, the same base in 90 percent of cases, one base. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1831.64s)]
*  So here's my question. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1841.76s)]
*  You know, we think about this all the time. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1844.4s)]
*  A lot of people talk about and you mentioned platform manufacturing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1846.08s)]
*  My question to you is, what do you really see? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1850.6000000000001s)]
*  What does that really what is that exactly? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1853.68s)]
*  What what does that look like to you? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1856.32s)]
*  Because everybody sort of says it and dances around it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1857.68s)]
*  But I don't I can't picture it concretely. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1860.48s)]
*  How is that really going to happen? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1863.64s)]
*  Great question. Yeah, sure. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1866.88s)]
*  So obviously, manufacturing is is a huge piece of these therapies and it's a very complicated piece. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  This is not making pills and putting them in packages. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1873.6s)]
*  It's a lot more complicated for a lot of reasons. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1876.84s)]
*  So that's sort of the the bad news side of the story. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  It takes a long time today. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1881.0s)]
*  It's expensive and it's very complex. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1882.12s)]
*  On the other hand, again, going back to my old monoclonal antibody days, I would have said the same thing in 1995 about monoclonal antibodies. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1885.28s)]
*  And over time, we had a thousand fold increase in yield and a thousand fold decrease in cost. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1892.08s)]
*  And it got much faster. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1896.1599999999999s)]
*  And we're already starting to see that here. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1897.48s)]
*  So I think in the ex vivo approaches, we will be able to simplify the manufacturing, make it less expensive, less complex. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1899.28s)]
*  But we'll still it's still going to be there as an ex vivo sort of thing. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1906.08s)]
*  And that that that's just impossible to overcome in that approach. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1909.1200000000001s)]
*  So that leads to the in vivo technologies that that Sam is talking about. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1912.1200000000001s)]
*  That's a whole different ballgame. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1916.36s)]
*  The manufacturing there is in many ways much, much simpler, even though the biology of delivery is much, much more complex. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1917.76s)]
*  But that's where all of this will be going. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1924.48s)]
*  And I think it will be then amenable to a lot of other diseases. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1926.76s)]
*  A big part of this and perjury is an example is delivery. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1930.3600000000001s)]
*  Delivery is a problem. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1932.96s)]
*  Right. And it depends on which tissues you need to deliver to and how many tissues. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1934.16s)]
*  We have a very active preclinical program in Duchenne muscular dystrophy in gene editing. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1938.72s)]
*  And it works beautifully in mice and it works beautifully in dogs. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1943.44s)]
*  But as you begin to scale it towards humans using AV, it's just not there yet. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1946.24s)]
*  And so we just have to solve the delivery problem because the editing problem has been solved. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1950.4s)]
*  Are there other questions? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1955.24s)]
*  That was a really good one. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1956.76s)]
*  No, I'm going to. Oh, wait. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1960.36s)]
*  I do see one. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1962.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1963.68s)]
*  Yes. Great. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1965.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1966.4s)]
*  Sorry. Thank you for this conversation on sickle cell disease. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1967.4s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1970.4s)]
*  My name is Dr. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1971.72s)]
*  Beverly. I'm patient consultant for patient engagement and cultural competence. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1972.72s)]
*  And I'm also on the board of sickle cell outreach organization in Westchester, New York. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1976.76s)]
*  And the fact that these patients are called drug seekers when it's not supported by medical [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1983.28s)]
*  literature is unconscionable. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1988.32s)]
*  My question concerning what you're discussing, what do you see the pros and cons of stem [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1990.8s)]
*  cell transplant versus the use of vertex in patients with sickle cell disease? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=1997.24s)]
*  Because I thought there were some good results from the stem cell transplant patients who [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2003.1599999999999s)]
*  have had it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2007.32s)]
*  Well, these are a kind of stem cell bone marrow stem cell. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2008.72s)]
*  That's what Casjevi actually is. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2011.8400000000001s)]
*  It's not an embryonic stem cell, but it's a bone marrow stem cell that's been engineered [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2015.1200000000001s)]
*  and then re homes to the bone marrow. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2019.2s)]
*  But there are other approaches, as you say, that are using different kinds of stem cell [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2021.72s)]
*  approaches. For example, in our diabetes programs, we're taking embryonic stem cells, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2025.3600000000001s)]
*  differentiating them into beta cells and then putting them back into the patients. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  And we're essentially curing those patients of type one diabetes. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2035.04s)]
*  So it really depends a little bit on each disease and what's best suited for the disease. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2037.72s)]
*  But the beauty of these bone marrow diseases, these immunologic diseases is if you can edit [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2042.24s)]
*  or get into the bone marrow stem cell, you can essentially replace the defective cell [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  with a cured or a normal cell. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2050.84s)]
*  If I may add something quickly, because we're out of time. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2053.12s)]
*  A lot of the stories you see the patient education, that's why it's so important, are [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2055.64s)]
*  around allogeneic stem cell transplants. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2059.88s)]
*  There have been cases where, you know, if you're taking an allogeneic stem cell transplant, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2062.2000000000003s)]
*  you're taking someone else's cells, you know, if they're matched and putting it into the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2066.0s)]
*  patient's body. Right. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2069.6s)]
*  And if it's not a perfect match, a lot of times you have a rejection or you have other [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2070.96s)]
*  outcomes. And in fact, there's a chance of death. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2075.28s)]
*  And so those are the stories that come out on the allogeneic stem cell transplant. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2077.68s)]
*  With Casgev, it's the patient's own cells. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2081.24s)]
*  And that makes a huge difference. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2084.28s)]
*  It's still a stem cell transplant, but it's an edited stem cell transplant. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2085.64s)]
*  And I think that's the part we all need to educate patients on, because not everybody [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2089.04s)]
*  understands the nuances of one versus another and what the puts and takes are. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUJAXxyHsDU&t=2092.96s)]
