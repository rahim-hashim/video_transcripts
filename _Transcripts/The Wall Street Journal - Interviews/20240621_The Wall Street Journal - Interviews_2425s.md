# Pinterest CEO on E-Commerce, AI and the Presidential Election | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg)
*  And I wanted to get your opinion about what this US presidential election is going to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=0.0s)]
*  be for US businesses in general. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=5.28s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=7.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=8.4s)]
*  I don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else in terms of those kinds of things. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=9.4s)]
*  But a couple thoughts I'd have is like, one, I think consumers and businesses have shown [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=15.76s)]
*  us time and time again that they're resilient. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=20.2s)]
*  And wherever the election goes, you're going to have roughly half the people that would [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=22.2s)]
*  have wished for a different outcome. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=25.76s)]
*  But at the same time, I think you're going to have, you know, consumers will go on with [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=27.76s)]
*  their life. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  They're going to be planning life moments. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=32.88s)]
*  They're going to be shopping. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=34.08s)]
*  You know, even with sticky inflation, things like that, consumer spending has actually [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=36.32s)]
*  been quite resilient. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=38.92s)]
*  And so, you know, we're not a platform where people go for political content. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  We don't take money from from political ads. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=43.92s)]
*  And so we're very much focused on just how do we make sure that when the when consumers [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=46.72s)]
*  are looking for a reprieve from that sort of toxic political content, that they have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=51.08s)]
*  that place they can go for an oasis away from that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=57.0s)]
*  Do you think, though, we're going to see a pullback in ad spending as we get close to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=59.16s)]
*  the election? Marketers often feel that there's a lot of noise, clutter, the divisiveness [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=63.52s)]
*  gets ugly. Do you think we'll see in general ad spending? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=68.36s)]
*  I think advertisers are going to be extremely mindful of where they place their ads as we [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=71.68s)]
*  get to to the election. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=76.72s)]
*  I think, you know, there's, you know, multiple reasons we don't take money from political [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  ads. You know, there's going to be a tremendous amount of money spent on political ads. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=82.2s)]
*  We won't take a penny of it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=84.8s)]
*  And that's for two reasons. One, that we do want consumers to have a choice for a safe [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=86.8s)]
*  space. From that, there are there's a there's a place for that for a place for that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=92.88s)]
*  discourse. But Pinterest isn't that place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=97.0s)]
*  So that's the one reason. The second reason is that advertisers, you know, as as we [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=101.0s)]
*  approach the election, I think advertising to be increasingly concerned about where they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=106.36s)]
*  place their ads. They're always concerned about, you know, what environment they place [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=109.8s)]
*  their ads in. I think they're going to be looking for a safe space for their ads. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=113.12s)]
*  And I think with the proliferation of Gen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  AI, I think your misinformation, things like that have been a huge issue across social [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=120.4s)]
*  media and for ad platforms. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=125.88s)]
*  And I think with Gen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=128.28s)]
*  AI, there's been a proliferation of the ability for people to make malicious content, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=129.24s)]
*  higher, you know, higher quality malicious content, more deceptive malicious content. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=134.88s)]
*  So I think it's a massive issue for a lot of platforms. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=140.4s)]
*  And so, you know, we're certainly mindful of that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  But again, we're not a place for political discourse. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  So we think we have a good alternative to that for advertisers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=146.72000000000003s)]
*  And we see that reflected already in the way that advertisers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=150.56s)]
*  We brought up safety. Right. And that's sort of at the heart of what's going on right [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  now. Obviously, the U.S. surge in general announced on Monday that he's going to push [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=157.08s)]
*  for warning labels on social media platforms, advising parents that using them are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=161.08s)]
*  basically hurting their mental health. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  You have been very outspoken about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=168.8s)]
*  This industry needs to do more. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you agree with the mandates that he's putting out? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=174.08s)]
*  And do you think Congress will pass it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=176.56s)]
*  Yeah. So, yes, I've been quite outspoken on this, I think, as the first and so the only [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  CEO of a social media company to say that the comparisons of social media and big [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=183.28s)]
*  tobacco are in many ways appropriate. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=187.36s)]
*  And, you know, we've done a lot to make sure that we are addressing issues on our own [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=190.8s)]
*  platform around those things. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=195.92s)]
*  And I reached out to Surgeon General Murthy to congratulate him on the efforts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=198.16s)]
*  I fully support being proactive on these issues. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=202.56s)]
*  And our focus on this is that in the same way that big tobacco in the same way that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  big tobacco needed warning labels and thoughtful regulation, you also need a health [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=211.92s)]
*  revolution to counter it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  And so while I think that warning labels may be helpful and appropriate in some cases, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  particularly done thoughtfully, we're also really focused on how do we give consumers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=224.88s)]
*  an alternative and, you know, how do you give them alternative for a healthy space? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=228.88s)]
*  So we're very focused on that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=234.0s)]
*  But would you actually, he listed things he wants you all to do, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=235.12s)]
*  And you do some of them already. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=238.72s)]
*  But do you agree that you would take those three things that he put out there? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=239.84s)]
*  I think an interesting parallel to this, you know, there's sort of the warning labels on [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  tobacco. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=248.32s)]
*  I think there might be a better analog in this when you think about, like, nutrition [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  labels where, you know, I'd love to see a world where consumers are more informed and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=252.0s)]
*  could differentiate between like, oh, you're going to have, you know, nutrition information, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=257.28s)]
*  whether you order a cheeseburger or order a salad. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  But what that nutrition label says is very different. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=264.88s)]
*  Yeah, but nobody looks at those labels. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=266.96s)]
*  We don't even understand those labels today. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think I think those things probably do have I think there are people that do look [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=270.64s)]
*  at those. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=274.08s)]
*  And but I think your point of like, how do you make it easy for the consumer is valid. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=275.68s)]
*  And I think this is one of the things that we're seeing, you know, over the last two [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=280.4s)]
*  years, we've seen seven consecutive quarters of accelerating user growth on our platform. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=284.08s)]
*  Gen Z is now our largest, fastest growing demographic, more than 40% of the platform. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=289.2s)]
*  And one of the top reasons that Gen Z states they come to Pinterest is that they see it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=293.44s)]
*  as an oasis away from the toxicity they experience elsewhere on social media. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=298.0s)]
*  So I think this is exactly to your point, like, yes, labels can help. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=302.32s)]
*  That may have a place. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  But I think this is my point on how do we help create the health revolution? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=306.8s)]
*  Even if people don't look at the nutrition labels, they know the ordering of salads [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  better than ordering the cheeseburger for them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  And how do we start to give consumers an alternative? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=316.16s)]
*  Because I think they haven't really had that alternative. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=318.08s)]
*  And so we've been tuning our platform for positivity, you know, things like diversity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=320.72s)]
*  by default in our feeds, you know, body type ranges, skin tone ranges, hair pattern selection, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=325.68s)]
*  these kinds of things that are helping to create a more positive environment. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  And so we're just making it easy for consumers to choose a place that they know is going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  to be healthier and doing that for teens. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=339.28s)]
*  But you have so many young kids on your platform, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=341.28s)]
*  So are they capable of making that decision? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  And don't you think should the business be regulated by the government at this point? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=346.32s)]
*  So, you know, again, I think there's probably a place for thoughtful regulation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=350.88s)]
*  And the parallel I use for this all the time is that, you know, so we've been talking about [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  big tobacco, let's talk about the auto industry. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=360.4s)]
*  There was a time when the auto industry was against safety standards for the automobiles. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=362.48s)]
*  Go back to like Ralph Nader's unsafe at any speed, the National Highway, NHTSA, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  National Highway Transportation Safety Act, where you started to regulate seatbelts in the cars. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=371.76s)]
*  But fast forward a few years. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=377.36s)]
*  And, you know, while, yes, you have seatbelts in every car, you know, auto manufacturers now [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=379.44s)]
*  compete on their safety records. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=383.6s)]
*  And so I'd love to see a world in social media where social media companies started competing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=386.56s)]
*  on their safety records. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=390.8s)]
*  And so we're not sitting around waiting for regulation to do the right thing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=392.32s)]
*  So, for example, you know, approximately a year ago, we came out and said we're going to make [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=395.92s)]
*  Pinterest private only for under 16. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=402.8s)]
*  We're going to do age collection on 100% of our users before regulation requires us to do it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=406.08s)]
*  We're going to do private only for users under 16. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=410.0s)]
*  Because we just, from what we saw on other platforms and even some activity on our own, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=413.6s)]
*  we came to the conclusion that it wasn't safe for children under 16 to have a publicly discoverable [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  profile online. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=425.36s)]
*  And so we said private only for under 16. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=427.44s)]
*  So we're not sitting around waiting for regulation to do the right thing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=429.92s)]
*  And, you know, is there a place for regulation? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=432.8s)]
*  I do think, can you set a baseline with regulation? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that would be great. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=437.44s)]
*  I would hope that the regulation, though, starts to set some standards that could actually [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=438.16s)]
*  spur competition. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=442.48s)]
*  So if you fast forward back to the auto example, while there is regulation that you should have [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=443.44s)]
*  safety belts, you also started to have crash test ratings. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=447.52s)]
*  And now you don't have regulation that stipulates every single sensor you put in the car. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  But auto manufacturers compete on their safety record. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  And so from a world, you know, a few decades ago where auto manufacturers, you know, many [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=458.96s)]
*  of them were saying that safety regulation would be against the business model to a world today [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=463.76s)]
*  where like you don't just want to buy an automobile that meets the minimum standards. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=468.24s)]
*  You want to put your family in the car that performs the best against those and auto [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=473.04s)]
*  manufacturers compete on it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=478.0s)]
*  Why can't there be a world like that for social media? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=479.68s)]
*  And so we're not waiting for that to appear from the ether. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=481.84s)]
*  We're trying to go create that and doing the right thing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=485.36s)]
*  And I think it's more important because when you talk about the automobile, it was my dad [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=487.12s)]
*  buying the automobile. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=491.2s)]
*  It was my mom. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  In this case, it's my 13-year-old or my 18-year-old. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=493.12s)]
*  And that's the difference. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=496.32s)]
*  On that point, though, I think this is one of the things when we made that change to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=497.28s)]
*  do private only for under 16. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=500.96s)]
*  You can imagine we had a lot of discussion of this inside our company of like, oh, is [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=502.64s)]
*  this going to hurt us with young users? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  Because, you know, it's going to take away something that the young users want. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=509.2s)]
*  As we had a lot of discussion on this and where we ultimately landed was we were just [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=512.24s)]
*  going to do it because it was right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=515.76s)]
*  And that and we were making a bet that in the long term that would work out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=517.52s)]
*  And the next quarter when we announced our results that quarter, we had to give some [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=521.36s)]
*  caution around, hey, this could be a headwind user growth. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=526.96s)]
*  Our stock dropped almost 20 percent in the immediate aftermath of that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=529.36s)]
*  But fast forward a year later, we've more than doubled. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=533.12s)]
*  And part of that is that what we found to your point of Gen Z and their part of this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  choice as well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=542.4s)]
*  Yes, Gen Z, I think in some ways you can look at Gen Z and say that they have become trapped [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=543.52s)]
*  in social media because of all their friends are there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=548.0s)]
*  They have to be there, too. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=549.76s)]
*  But they're looking for something different also. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=551.44s)]
*  And so what we found is as we've provided that rather than that being a headwind for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=554.0s)]
*  us, Gen Z users, when you ask them, one of the top reasons they will state is they see [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=559.04s)]
*  us as an oasis away from that toxicity. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  So being in a private space is actually working well for us with Gen Z users. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=565.76s)]
*  So I think there are so many examples of where you can do well by doing good. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=570.4s)]
*  And I think there's more of that that we're trying to do that I hope the industry does [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=575.04s)]
*  as well. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=577.52s)]
*  Maybe you just have the good kids and the bad kids will just go somewhere else. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=577.92s)]
*  But that's a whole other thing. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  There's hundreds of millions of them. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  So you obviously are on this positivity kick and God bless you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=585.28s)]
*  But you also had your issues, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=593.36s)]
*  There was the news outlet that found last year that men were creating sex themes image [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=593.68s)]
*  boards for little girls, little girls on the platform. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=597.76s)]
*  Tell me how you went about fixing that because it happens every couple of weeks. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=600.88s)]
*  There's another social media platform. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=607.28s)]
*  The Journal has done extensive investigations, obviously, much of which Congress has called [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=608.88s)]
*  these companies to the floor to question them on this and pushing this forward. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=614.08s)]
*  How did you fix it and how do you prevent it from happening over and over again? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=619.2s)]
*  So it's a great point. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=624.32s)]
*  These issues have been across every social media platform. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  And that had been found on many other social media platforms prior to Pinterest. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  We were quite surprised to find that there was some of that happening on Pinterest. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  To be clear, the content by itself was innocuous. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  But then with people collating together and they made lewd comments or things like that, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=640.48s)]
*  that's quite disturbing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=644.48s)]
*  The sad reality, the sad reality, had we wanted to just ride out the press cycle on that, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=646.24s)]
*  we could have. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=651.36s)]
*  We absolutely could have. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=652.64s)]
*  And that's what most other platforms have done. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=653.52s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=655.12s)]
*  There's some great investigative journalism from Wall Street Journal on this where it's [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=656.16s)]
*  happening in the influencer and creator community. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=660.64s)]
*  And had we wanted to ride out the press cycle, sadly, we could have. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=663.36s)]
*  But that's not what we did. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=666.88s)]
*  When that happened, that's what led us to, we weren't aware of it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=668.48s)]
*  As soon as we became aware of it, we moved aggressively to go take action against those [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=671.76s)]
*  bad actors using AI to go spot the bad actors, remove them. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=675.2s)]
*  But those were the things that led us to the conclusion that it's just not safe to have [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=679.44s)]
*  a child under 16 publicly discoverable online. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=683.2s)]
*  And that's when we went to private only. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=686.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=688.16s)]
*  And we just felt it was the right thing to do. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=688.64s)]
*  But sadly, we could have ridden out the press cycle. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=690.24s)]
*  Many of the platforms do. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=692.64s)]
*  But that's not what we chose to do. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=693.52s)]
*  We're trying to create a different environment. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=694.64s)]
*  We can't get away with riding out the press cycle anymore. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=695.76s)]
*  Because now what most journals are doing is going back six months later, five months [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=697.84s)]
*  later, a year later, and keep checking. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=701.6s)]
*  And that's why the work on Meta has been so successful. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  Because that's what they were doing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=705.84s)]
*  It was just keeps repeating every couple of months. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=707.44s)]
*  The industry needs accountability. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=709.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=710.64s)]
*  We called for that a year ago here. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=711.36s)]
*  Last year here at Cannes, we launched the Inspired Internet Pledge. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  And what we called for in that was accountability for the industry. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  We said, let's start with ourselves and let's measure ourselves as an industry on emotional [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  well-being outcomes, on our safety standards. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=726.08s)]
*  Let's measure ourselves on that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  Let's publish it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=729.2s)]
*  Let's share what works and try to get better as an industry. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=730.24s)]
*  Does self-regulation really work? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=732.88s)]
*  Every day in Cannes and every day in this business, it's another consortium, another this. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  How realistic are these big issues? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=739.76s)]
*  And they are real. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=742.24s)]
*  I mean, these are our children. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=743.0400000000001s)]
*  Do you think self-regulation could fix this? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  So to me, it's not an either or. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=747.5200000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=749.2s)]
*  Again, I think this is a place where thoughtful regulation is likely very appropriate. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  I think there's lots of examples of sort of market failures happening. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=755.84s)]
*  So I think thoughtful regulation is appropriate, underscore unthoughtful. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, part of what I would call for in that is regulate the outcomes versus the tactics. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  I think the technology moves so fast, it's going to be hard to keep up with every single tactic. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=767.76s)]
*  But you could regulate the outcomes, just like we have crash test standards. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=772.64s)]
*  Why can't we start to think about what are the emotional well-being outcomes? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=776.64s)]
*  And so that's what we were calling for. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's not an either or. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  Again, big tobacco needed thoughtful regulation. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=784.72s)]
*  But you also need a health revolution to count on. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  There are great businesses built out of that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=789.28s)]
*  And so we want to prove there's a real business model built on positivity. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=791.2s)]
*  A more recent example, you had lots of auto manufacturers funding climate misinformation [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=796.0s)]
*  not that long ago. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=801.92s)]
*  And you've had some good government interaction to create investment vehicles, things like that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=803.28s)]
*  But when did you start to really get momentum around electric vehicles? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=808.88s)]
*  When there was a good business model in it, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=812.48s)]
*  And so we're trying to prove that there's a good business model and positivity. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=814.72s)]
*  And two years in, it's working. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  If you're making money, people will do it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=820.48s)]
*  It's working. That's right. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=821.68s)]
*  Do you have children? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=822.72s)]
*  Yes, one daughter, 10 years old. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=823.84s)]
*  10 years old. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=825.92s)]
*  Does she use social media? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=827.12s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=828.56s)]
*  When will you allow her to use it? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=829.28s)]
*  So 13 is the current age, but platforms are created very differently. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=831.04s)]
*  Is there one or two you would allow her to have? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=838.4s)]
*  We're doing a lot of work to say that at Pinterest, we think that can be a safe space, obviously. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  But 13 is our minimum age. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=845.92s)]
*  So at 13, she wants to be on Pinterest today. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=847.76s)]
*  We do things together on Pinterest, but on her own at 13. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=852.88s)]
*  But to say it very directly, this is a big part of why I came to Pinterest. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that as a father of a young daughter, I find the prospect of her being on social media [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  absolutely terrifying. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  I think every parent should be terrified as well. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think when you look at the emotional wellbeing impacts to young people, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=872.88s)]
*  you've had the Surgeon General come out with this. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=878.24s)]
*  Jonathan Haight recently with the Anxious Generation [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=881.76s)]
*  that really put together a good summary of the research on this. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=885.52s)]
*  But the research has been overruling and clear for quite some time [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=888.16s)]
*  that there's meaningful impact on emotional wellbeing from a lot of what's happening on social media. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=891.36s)]
*  It disproportionately affects young people and disproportionately affects young women. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=896.48s)]
*  And so as a father of a young daughter, it's deeply personal for me that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=901.6s)]
*  I want us to build a great business. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=906.4s)]
*  But I want us to build a great business that we can be proud of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  and that we'd be okay to have our young people on [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  and that other parents can have their young people on as well. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=913.52s)]
*  Talk about the push and pull that you face in trying to do this. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  You talked a little bit about how you won't want political advertising, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  but that's really not all that hurts children. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=924.08s)]
*  It's normal advertising every day. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=926.96s)]
*  Do you accept the dry-it drug craze? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=930.0s)]
*  Do you accept those on your platform? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=932.48s)]
*  We don't. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=934.08s)]
*  And I think this is where there's always more work to do even for us. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=936.32s)]
*  We've talked about tuning the AI for positivity, tuning for inclusivity. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=940.64s)]
*  We've seen great progress there. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=944.48s)]
*  One of the recent launches we had in our inclusive AI was body type ranges. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=947.12s)]
*  To say, hey, there's not just one image of beauty. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=951.6s)]
*  And people come in all shapes and sizes and there's lots to be proud of. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=954.96s)]
*  And so I think there's more work for us to do on this. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=959.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think on the advertising, we are thoughtful about where we take money. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=964.32s)]
*  And so taking money from political advertising. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  But what's that like when you've got a CFO who's like, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=970.64s)]
*  there's how many billions of dollars now going into these drug diet, drug ads? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=973.44s)]
*  We have a fantastic CFO who is absolutely fully aligned with, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=978.24s)]
*  we're going to have a great business by doing our things. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=982.32s)]
*  So he's like, OK, you don't need to take that money. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=984.48s)]
*  She. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=986.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=986.9s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=987.4s)]
*  Good she. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=987.9s)]
*  Woo, she. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=988.4s)]
*  Love it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  Love it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  Now that's positive. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=994.0s)]
*  She is absolutely aligned with that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=994.5s)]
*  Our entire team is. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=996.64s)]
*  This is the business we want to build. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=998.08s)]
*  And again, I think that is, I came to Pinterest for this reason. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=999.36s)]
*  That I think we can build a great business on positivity. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1004.08s)]
*  That is my hope. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1007.92s)]
*  Not just that I don't want us to just be back to that auto safety example. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1008.8s)]
*  If there's a future state of the world where we build the Volvo social media, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1015.04s)]
*  that's great. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  But I think even better, if we can inspire the broader industry to compete on safety, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1018.8s)]
*  that's what will be a win for me and our whole team. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1023.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1025.68s)]
*  We're going to move to AI. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1025.84s)]
*  But I'll give you one more question on this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1026.72s)]
*  Obviously, everybody's algorithm is going to fix everything. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1028.72s)]
*  But one of the things that's really interesting is the fact that these algorithms [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1032.24s)]
*  basically promote addiction. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1036.4s)]
*  It's like, Netflix does it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1038.88s)]
*  Right now, that thing comes up, your next program. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1040.72s)]
*  How do you avoid having that algorithm when you're selling advertisers on the fact that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1042.88s)]
*  you're now growing better than most companies with this Gen Z? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  How do you make sure that you're not doing that kind of thing? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1051.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a fantastic question. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1054.64s)]
*  I think there's AI, like any technology, can be used for good or for bad. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1057.44s)]
*  And so we're very focused on how do we use AI for good. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  And so we talked about tuning AI for positivity. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1064.72s)]
*  We actually use AI to spot bad actors on the platform and get them off. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1067.52s)]
*  But there's also things that we're doing to look at, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1072.08s)]
*  well, what kind of engagement do we want on the platform? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1075.28s)]
*  So one of the big changes I made when I came into Pinterest was that, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1077.76s)]
*  you know, if you look across social media, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1081.36s)]
*  I think a big part of what made social media more toxic [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1082.72s)]
*  was when AI was put in charge of the content that we see. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1085.6s)]
*  And it was given the objective of maximizing your view time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1088.6399999999999s)]
*  And what happened is that, you know, the AI figured out pretty quickly that, like, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1091.68s)]
*  what keeps you looking the longest is showing you triggering content. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1096.48s)]
*  Even more precisely because people say, oh, I don't just see triggering content. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1099.76s)]
*  I see some positive stuff, too. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1102.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's figure out how to keep you on the dopamine roller coaster. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1104.16s)]
*  I showed you some negative stuff for a little while. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1106.72s)]
*  Now I can show you some positive stuff. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1108.96s)]
*  Oh, you've been happy for too long. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1110.4s)]
*  Let's bring you back down and show you some negative stuff. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1111.84s)]
*  And then, oh, after a little while that bring you back up. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1113.68s)]
*  It feels like hand. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1115.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, so if you just ask the AI to solve for view time, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1117.68s)]
*  this is the outcome. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1123.44s)]
*  This is what we've seen. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1124.16s)]
*  We all had this experience that, you know, social media used to be a place where you [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1125.68s)]
*  reconnect with long lost friends and it was helping democracies rise up and all these things. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1129.6s)]
*  And then one day it wasn't. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1134.72s)]
*  Well, what's shifted? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1135.68s)]
*  It used to be a chronological feed of what your friends posted. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1136.56s)]
*  And then over time it became way before the current conversations on Gen. AI. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1139.28s)]
*  AI has been in charge of what you see on social media for many years. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1143.76s)]
*  And it just figured out that you linger for longer on triggering content, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  on things that may make you feel worse about yourself. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1151.04s)]
*  And so back to what we're doing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1152.96s)]
*  We're tuning for positivity and we're not optimizing for view time. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1154.8s)]
*  So when I came in, we shifted from a view time optimization to an action based optimization [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1158.96s)]
*  where and giving users more explicit ability to say what they're interested in. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1164.56s)]
*  So let me make this more tangible. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  When Pinterest was optimized for view time maximization, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  we saw a lot of the same triggering content rising on Pinterest. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  You see on other platforms. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1178.96s)]
*  That was deeply troubling. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1180.24s)]
*  When we shifted to optimizing more for things that users say they want to see again, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1182.0s)]
*  where then you're engaging their conscious mind. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1186.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not just what you looked at, which can get sort of made you look kind of content. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1187.84s)]
*  But when you trigger their conscious mind and ask, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1191.84s)]
*  like the metaphor I use for this a lot is, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1195.04s)]
*  we've all had this experience of being stuck in a traffic jam. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1197.4399999999998s)]
*  And you know when you get to the front of the traffic jam, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1200.1599999999999s)]
*  you shouldn't look at the car wreck. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1202.32s)]
*  We know that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1203.76s)]
*  But we all do. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1204.8s)]
*  I sat here for 45 minutes. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1205.52s)]
*  I want to know what happened. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  So we all sneak a peek. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1207.28s)]
*  In a world where the AI determines what you see, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1208.96s)]
*  and it's asked to match my view time, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1211.68s)]
*  it says, oh, you looked at the car wreck. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1213.44s)]
*  I'll show you another car wreck. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1215.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh, you looked at that one too until it's all car wrecks. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  But if you ask somebody, do you want to see another car wreck? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1218.5600000000002s)]
*  Most people would say, oh, goodness, no, that was terrible. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1222.24s)]
*  So we started not just in the AI, but in what we tuned for saying, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1224.96s)]
*  well, let's find ways that the user can state what they're interested in. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1229.0400000000002s)]
*  And that's when all of a sudden, instead of in child psychology, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1232.3200000000002s)]
*  sort of say downstairs brain versus upstairs brain. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1237.52s)]
*  You engage the upstairs brain. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1237.92s)]
*  And the upstairs brain says, I don't want to see the triggering stuff. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  And you get a choice. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  So we're bringing in more choice. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1242.48s)]
*  We're tuning not for view time, but for actionability. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1244.16s)]
*  And back to your question on advertising, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1247.68s)]
*  it actually aligns well with the business model. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1249.6000000000001s)]
*  Because if you look at our growth, how we've doubled our revenue growth rate [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1252.4s)]
*  from H1 to H2 last year. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1257.68s)]
*  And then we doubled it again in what we published last quarter, roughly. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  And a huge part of that has been driving actionability for advertisers. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1263.92s)]
*  But back to the view time issue, so much actionability for advertisers [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1267.2s)]
*  were helping people to do things that engage in the real world. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1270.56s)]
*  Not just what they wanted to see. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1274.0s)]
*  And what they wanted. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1275.28s)]
*  So whether it was, help me find a great outfit for Cannes, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  or refresh the wardrobe for summer, or how do I cook a meal [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1278.8s)]
*  that's going to be great to gather a group of friends or family? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1282.0800000000002s)]
*  How do I redesign a room for hosting? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1285.1200000000001s)]
*  These are all things that have tie into what people are doing in the real world. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1287.2s)]
*  So we're building a business around not just positivity, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1290.16s)]
*  but we're building a business around what you do off of Pinterest. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1293.6000000000001s)]
*  Off of that screen. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  We brought up AI and obviously everybody's been using it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1298.56s)]
*  And sometimes you say to yourself, maybe the machines need a little help, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1300.8s)]
*  and maybe some humans should be hired to do some of this stuff. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1304.0s)]
*  But that's a whole other conversation. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1306.0s)]
*  Obviously, AI is the topic. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1308.0s)]
*  How is it going to impact everyone? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1309.52s)]
*  Obviously, Google and Meta have dominated this industry for so long now. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1312.24s)]
*  Do you think with Gen.i coming along, that there will be a restacking of the tech industry? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1317.3600000000001s)]
*  So I think it's a disruptive technology for sure. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1324.96s)]
*  I think though, I think it'll play out in maybe some different ways than people expect. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1329.6s)]
*  So a couple things I'd say. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1335.68s)]
*  One, sometimes you hear this argument of like, isn't it going to be the one, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1336.64s)]
*  isn't going to be the case that just the largest get better, right? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1340.48s)]
*  Because it's a game just for the largest platforms. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1344.16s)]
*  And I think it's actually a little more similar to like cloud computing, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1346.56s)]
*  where there's I think a democratizing element of Gen.i as well. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  Where in cloud compute, it made it so you could have looked at cloud computing a decade ago and said, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1355.84s)]
*  doesn't that mean just a few platforms are going to be the winners? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  But in reality, yes, you'd only have a few platforms that are massive in cloud compute. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1364.08s)]
*  But you have so many more businesses that can thrive now because they're [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1368.8s)]
*  able to easily access building blocks in cloud compute. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1373.28s)]
*  You know, we've done five startups, right? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1376.16s)]
*  The first three of those startups, like we had to build our own data centers. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1378.48s)]
*  Like, oh my gosh, like no startup now would even conceive of building their own data center. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1381.28s)]
*  It's so much easier to get going. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1385.2s)]
*  That had a democratizing effect. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1386.4s)]
*  I think with Gen.i, you're going to see similarly, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1388.08s)]
*  there will be building blocks available to a lot of folks. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1390.08s)]
*  And one of the things I've said on this, I talked about this at Davos almost five years ago, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1392.64s)]
*  exactly five years ago now, that, you know, AI thrives on feedback loops. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1398.48s)]
*  So I think as these AI building blocks become available, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1403.68s)]
*  businesses really ought to be looking at like what are the unique feedback loops in their business? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1406.64s)]
*  Because then you can take off the shelf AI and train it to do something unique in your business. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1410.72s)]
*  And for us, this is where we have human curation at scale, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1415.3600000000001s)]
*  where it's not just that we can show you great shopping recommendations, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1418.48s)]
*  people spending time on Pinterest planning outfits, planning vacations, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1421.2800000000002s)]
*  so we can make great recommendations from our AI. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1424.96s)]
*  You brought up that training though. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1427.6000000000001s)]
*  Basically, the business of digital advertising, you know, it's the surveillance economy. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1430.0s)]
*  But as we move into this AI world, privacy is going to be at the forefront again. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1434.88s)]
*  How are you training your models on the content? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1440.3200000000002s)]
*  How much of a consent are your users giving? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1444.0s)]
*  And do you think this is the next, you know, surveillance economy on crack cocaine that we're about to see? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1446.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, here's the thing. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1452.3200000000002s)]
*  I think you've got to, you know, platforms each operate in very different ways. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1453.44s)]
*  I think you've got to sort of like peel it back a little. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  And so if you think about privacy, I've been talking about this for a while, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1460.3200000000002s)]
*  with cookie deprecation coming, you know, Apple already made their move on cookie deprecation, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1464.64s)]
*  Chrome cookie deprecation is coming, Q1 next year. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1468.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's moved a few times, but I think it's clearly going to happen. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1471.52s)]
*  You know, as third party cookies go away, I think that shifts the whole industry from the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  surveillance issue to how do you do these things in a privacy safe way. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  But then I think you're also going to see delineation across platforms around where [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1484.64s)]
*  users have real intent and where users can find the ads helpful. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1488.8000000000002s)]
*  Let me make that a little more tangible. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1493.28s)]
*  Right, but do they want you training it on their content? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1494.32s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1496.96s)]
*  Let me make this a little more tangible. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1497.84s)]
*  If you look at most of social media, this is where Pinterest is very different than [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1499.36s)]
*  the rest of social media or most of social media. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1501.68s)]
*  Most of social media that users in an entertainment based context, they're there to, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1504.0s)]
*  whether they're watching funny dance videos or watching longer form content, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1508.32s)]
*  they're there for entertainment. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1510.96s)]
*  And the ads are an interruption from that thing that they're trying to do. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1512.6399999999999s)]
*  And while you would hear like, oh, well, we can serve you great ads because of the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1515.84s)]
*  influencers that you're following. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1518.8s)]
*  Which one do you think mattered more? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1520.16s)]
*  The handful of influencers you were following on that platform or the fact that they were [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1521.6s)]
*  tracking across every single retail site across the entire internet. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1525.04s)]
*  Obviously the latter. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  As cookies go away, I think you'll see a delineation between entertainment based social [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1530.32s)]
*  media platforms and platforms where the consumer expresses intent directly. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1535.04s)]
*  And to be very clear, Pinterest doesn't need to track you around the internet to know what [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1539.28s)]
*  you're interested in. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1543.1999999999998s)]
*  People come to Pinterest and tell us what they're interested in. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1544.32s)]
*  That not only puts us in a place to be able to serve great relevant ads, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1546.6399999999999s)]
*  without third party cookies, it also says that the ads are aligned with the user. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1552.08s)]
*  So instead of it being the case that, oh, I went and looked at this thing and now it's [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  following me around the internet. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1561.36s)]
*  I came to Pinterest and said, help me with what to wear to can. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1562.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1566.1599999999999s)]
*  But if I see an ad that shows me a great relevant outfit, that's a good thing. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1566.3999999999999s)]
*  Are they okay with you training? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1568.56s)]
*  But that's the point. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1569.52s)]
*  Even though you're doing it within your own holes and you're not tracking them outside, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1570.3999999999999s)]
*  if you're training your models based on their data, how explicit is that for them? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  And do they understand that? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1579.28s)]
*  I think this is one of the primary reasons people come to Pinterest. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1580.08s)]
*  So if you ask users on Pinterest, I think it's really about agency for the user. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1582.24s)]
*  And so when the user's tracked around the internet without their knowledge, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  that's not agency for the user. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1588.96s)]
*  When they're seeing recommendations on a platform that are based on them being tracked [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1591.12s)]
*  around the internet, that's not agency for the user. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1594.24s)]
*  When a user comes to the platform and says, help me find a better outfit to wear to can. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1597.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1601.28s)]
*  And you show them great recommendations and they say, oh, you understand what I want to wear. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1601.9199999999998s)]
*  And you make a great recommendation. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1607.76s)]
*  That's agency for the user. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1608.96s)]
*  So on Pinterest, users are actually curating their tastes on Pinterest. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1610.0s)]
*  They want us to show them recommendations from that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1614.32s)]
*  I think there the user has agency. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1616.96s)]
*  I think that's where you'll see delineation between the platforms of where were the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1618.48s)]
*  recommendations without the user's conscious thought? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1622.24s)]
*  Where were they with the user's conscious thought? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1626.0s)]
*  And to be very clear, users come to Pinterest seeking those recommendations is what they're [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1627.76s)]
*  there for. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1632.48s)]
*  And we're curating based on what they've expressed on Pinterest, not tracking them around the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1633.6s)]
*  web to make recommendations off of those. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1640.16s)]
*  Well, I think we will celebrate cookie deprecation and now we've just replaced it with your [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1642.8s)]
*  shopping behavior because that's going to be better. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1646.08s)]
*  That's the other thing that's hilarious. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  We're like, oh, it's going to get better with stopping cookies. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1650.16s)]
*  It's just going to be your shopping behavior. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1652.0s)]
*  I think there's going to be a whole new tidal wave of that that's going to happen. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1653.6s)]
*  Well, I think it depends on, again, I think it's about what the user understands is happening. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1656.08s)]
*  So the world that I love to see, and this is what we're solving with shopping on Pinterest. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1661.36s)]
*  I think the first 25 plus years of e-commerce sort of solved for buying and killed shopping. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1667.04s)]
*  The distinction being that the first 25 years of e-commerce is sort of utilitarian. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1671.9199999999998s)]
*  How do I get the cheapest and the fastest? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1677.04s)]
*  But you have, depending on what data you look at, 70 to 80% of shopping has not yet gone [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1679.12s)]
*  online. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1686.8s)]
*  So what's that other 70 or 80%? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1688.1599999999999s)]
*  It's walking into a great boutique and having someone help you style an outfit. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1691.2s)]
*  It's walking the bazaar. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1695.92s)]
*  It's being inspired. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1696.96s)]
*  It's discovering. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1697.8400000000001s)]
*  And so that's what we're trying to build on Pinterest. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1698.96s)]
*  And again, I think when the user says, I understand this is personalized to me. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1700.96s)]
*  I wanted to personalize to me. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1704.8s)]
*  It's personalized to me based on actions I took where I curated on this platform. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1706.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that is with the user's understanding and the user has agency. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1710.96s)]
*  I think when it happens that users are being tracked around the web and they're seeing [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1714.48s)]
*  a recommendation on a platform where they had no shopping intent, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1718.0s)]
*  I think that's more the sort of insidious nature of what you're describing. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1720.96s)]
*  We'll talk about retail, but I still want Amazon to buy you so I can just click in an [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1724.5600000000002s)]
*  order from Amazon. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1728.24s)]
*  But that's just my dream. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1729.0400000000002s)]
*  But both things should be true. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1730.0800000000002s)]
*  Amazon's a great partner for us. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1731.5200000000002s)]
*  I think having simplicity when you're ready to purchase and then also being able to walk [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1733.7600000000002s)]
*  that bazaar and discover. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1736.8000000000002s)]
*  But then when you do discover, seamlessly buy. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1737.8400000000001s)]
*  That's been part of what we're solving. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1739.7600000000002s)]
*  We're doing with great partners. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1740.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1741.5200000000002s)]
*  We have a few more minutes and I just wanted to ask you about TikTok, obviously, because [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1741.8400000000001s)]
*  basically most marketers are walking down the cross that right now and being like, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1746.8000000000002s)]
*  oh my God, don't ban this thing. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1749.76s)]
*  We really, really need it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1750.96s)]
*  As the government sort of pushes for either this to be sold or to kill it altogether, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1753.28s)]
*  is this an opportunity for you? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1758.56s)]
*  And are you seeing Adulas shift at all from you? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1760.08s)]
*  Are you benefiting in any way or are you using that in your pitch? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1762.24s)]
*  Well, what I'd say is first of all, we're not sitting around hoping for the demise of [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1765.44s)]
*  other platforms. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1768.72s)]
*  We're busy building a great platform that's very different than what people find elsewhere [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1769.52s)]
*  in social media. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1773.12s)]
*  And by the way, for the last two years, we've seen that. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1774.32s)]
*  That's what's accelerated our growth with both users and advertisers that we're building [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1776.48s)]
*  with this unique intersection between social search and commerce. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1780.3200000000002s)]
*  This is different than anything else in social media and different than anything else you'd [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  find in sort of traditional search or those kinds of things. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1787.2s)]
*  That's really working for us. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1789.92s)]
*  We're focused on continuing to just differentiate on our own. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1790.8s)]
*  That's working with advertisers, working with users. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1792.8s)]
*  That said, you talked about regulation. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1795.3600000000001s)]
*  I think one of the very few bipartisan issues has been concern over ill effects on social [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1798.0800000000002s)]
*  media. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1804.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1805.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1805.52s)]
*  And there are different flavors of that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1806.16s)]
*  But I think you're seeing that with governments around the world being really concerned around [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1810.72s)]
*  what's happening on these social media platforms. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1815.68s)]
*  Do you agree that government should have went after TikTok in this way? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1818.0s)]
*  So without coming on any one platform, I do think to say that governments are increasingly [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1820.56s)]
*  concerned with what happens with your data, where it's going, what's being done with it, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1826.96s)]
*  and are going to take action to make sure that consumers are protected. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1831.2s)]
*  I think you see that happening around the world in lots of different flavors. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1834.32s)]
*  And I think you should expect more of it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1837.12s)]
*  And again, as that happens, that's where we feel really good that we have a much more, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1838.32s)]
*  we have intent to express directly on our platform. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1844.0s)]
*  And so we're able to give users great recommendations in a privacy safe way. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1846.24s)]
*  But I think you're going to see more and more of that. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1849.76s)]
*  It's bipartisan here in the US. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1851.12s)]
*  I think it's happening with governments around the world. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1852.24s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1854.0s)]
*  Since he's not going to tell me that Amazon's buying them tomorrow, I'm going to open it [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1854.48s)]
*  up for questions. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1858.56s)]
*  Anybody have a question for him? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1859.76s)]
*  Gentleman in the back. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1861.28s)]
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1864.56s)]
*  My name is Harvey. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1865.36s)]
*  I am from London, as you can tell from my accent. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1866.24s)]
*  Quickly, I want to ask you about, you spoke about Pinterest not tracking users outside [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1869.52s)]
*  of the platform. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1874.48s)]
*  How does the Pinterest pixel behave differently from the Facebook pixel? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1875.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so I think there's a difference. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1880.48s)]
*  So as cookies deprecate, there's sort of two things to think about. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1881.76s)]
*  There's when was it being used to serve relevant ads? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1884.96s)]
*  And when is it being used for ad measurement? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1890.1599999999999s)]
*  And so as we think about that, I think companies are in similar boats on ad measurement where [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1892.72s)]
*  everybody's got to move to privacy safe measurement where instead of measuring that one individual [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1897.76s)]
*  user, how do you move to privacy safe features like clean rooms and things like that? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  And so the whole industry is moving in that direction. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1904.96s)]
*  My comments on the relevancy of the ads, those kinds of things, we don't need to track users [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1907.2s)]
*  around the internet to know what they're interested in. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1913.52s)]
*  They come to Pinterest and tell us. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1914.88s)]
*  We're not reliant upon tracking activity across other retailers to know what they're [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1916.32s)]
*  interested in. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1920.0s)]
*  They tell us directly. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1920.32s)]
*  So just like the rest of the industry, we're moving towards privacy safe measurement. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1921.92s)]
*  But I think we're very well positioned relative to the rest of social media in that users [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1925.68s)]
*  express intent directly on our platform. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1930.96s)]
*  We know users' preferences because they curate on our platform versus needing to track them [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1932.96s)]
*  around sites across the web. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1937.44s)]
*  But don't you then track them when they go to the retail site from your site to make [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1938.64s)]
*  sure that you can then offer the advertiser proof of return of the ad they saw? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1943.52s)]
*  So this is the measurement point? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1948.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1950.4s)]
*  This is where the whole industry is moving towards privacy safe measurement where instead [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1950.48s)]
*  of measuring that one user, you start to do things that basically look at like cohorting [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1953.04s)]
*  and those kinds of things that are privacy safe. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1957.92s)]
*  So instead of it being that one user that's measured, you're measuring at cohort levels [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1959.44s)]
*  and those kinds of things. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1963.3600000000001s)]
*  The whole industry is moving toward that. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1964.08s)]
*  And so we're moving in that same direction. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1965.92s)]
*  But if a cohort means that you're a Walmart or let's just take any client and they put [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1967.92s)]
*  up a thousand names into a cloud and say, can you target these people? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1972.4s)]
*  These are our customers. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1975.44s)]
*  Number, number, 10. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1976.96s)]
*  And then you give them back. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1978.0s)]
*  Well, are we getting to a point where it's 40% of the cohorts that you gave me, but not [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1978.96s)]
*  individuals actually clicked? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1983.92s)]
*  I think that's generally correct. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1986.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1988.48s)]
*  And instead of knowing this specific user bought this specific thing at this specific [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1988.72s)]
*  place, it'll be more, okay, you know, users in a cohort behaved in this kind of way. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1991.8400000000001s)]
*  And so that's privacy preserving technology. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1996.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1999.04s)]
*  Any other questions? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=1999.44s)]
*  One in the front. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2000.24s)]
*  My name is Carrie. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2002.24s)]
*  I own a global communications agency, Sway. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2003.2s)]
*  I am a global campaigner on suicide bereavement and suicide prevention. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2007.1200000000001s)]
*  And Pinterest has taken some remarkable steps. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2012.32s)]
*  I also have a daughter who's six and 16. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2015.44s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you the question. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2018.32s)]
*  You've talked a lot about the children, but I'd love to know your position on the parents. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2019.92s)]
*  Is one of the biggest problems we have is the generational divide in technology and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2023.92s)]
*  parents just not getting out of the tech or how to help their children. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2028.48s)]
*  And so I'd love to know what programs you have for parents and how you're advancing [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2033.1200000000001s)]
*  that conversation. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2036.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2037.36s)]
*  Fantastic question. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2037.6s)]
*  So two things I'd say. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2038.88s)]
*  I think the first is, you know, we've got to make it easier for parents to do the right thing. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2040.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2045.84s)]
*  And, you know, I'd love to see a world, you know, where consumers have more choice and [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2046.64s)]
*  more clear understanding of how different platforms are going to deliver different kinds [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2054.16s)]
*  of content. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2058.16s)]
*  If you look at the prior media world, you know, at some point you stop calling it social [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2058.56s)]
*  media. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2062.16s)]
*  It's just media because it's where most of the consumption of media is happening now. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2062.4s)]
*  But in the prior media world, you understood, you know, in a cable TV environment, for [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2066.4799999999996s)]
*  example, you knew like, oh, well, these kinds of TV stations, you know, may not have safe [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2070.72s)]
*  content for my kids. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2075.12s)]
*  These ones do. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2076.3999999999996s)]
*  And I can make a choice of, you know, which ones I let my kids watch. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2077.2s)]
*  Well, as the content fragmented over the last several years, the platforms actually [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2081.4399999999996s)]
*  consolidated. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2086.7999999999997s)]
*  So you had just a few platforms and a user lost choice. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2087.52s)]
*  I would love to see a future world where in the same way that you can say, oh, well, you [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2091.2799999999997s)]
*  know, I know if I put it on the Disney Channel or, you know, network TV before 8 p.m., it's [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2095.2s)]
*  going to be generally safe for my kids. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2101.04s)]
*  You know, I hope it's not just us. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2103.2799999999997s)]
*  I hope there's a future world where there's multiple platforms and the platform sort of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2104.3999999999996s)]
*  fragment back out and users make choices based on what types of content. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2107.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, if I want political news, I can go to this platform that's the town square for political [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2110.56s)]
*  news. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2114.56s)]
*  If I want places where I know, you know, my kids are going to be safe, I can go over here. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2115.04s)]
*  And so I think we've got to give consumers more choice and then on parents make it easier [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2120.24s)]
*  for them to take safe actions like knowing, OK, this platform functions differently than [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2125.2799999999997s)]
*  this one. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  I think also on parental tools, the parental tools have to be easier as well. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2129.84s)]
*  We're like, you know, right now they tend to be buried. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2135.12s)]
*  They're way deep down in the settings. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2137.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't figure it out. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2138.96s)]
*  And, you know, two ways we're approaching that one is, you know, try to give simple, you [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2140.48s)]
*  know, tools where, you know, with us, when we did age collection, parents can go in and [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2144.64s)]
*  set a passcode for like, OK, here's the age of the person using this app. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2150.24s)]
*  Here's the passcode that either parent knows. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2153.28s)]
*  Super simple. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2154.8s)]
*  But then also we're just trying to make it safe by default. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2156.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2159.0400000000004s)]
*  And I think we need more of that where, you know, safety should be the default. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2159.28s)]
*  And that's the way that we're trying to operate. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2163.6800000000003s)]
*  And we're not perfect. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2165.84s)]
*  We've had a lot of lessons learned from the past, you know, tuning for more positivity, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2167.36s)]
*  tuning to keep bad content off, but then trying to make it easy for parents to take the right [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2172.0s)]
*  action. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2177.1200000000003s)]
*  I think when your daughter's 13, you're really going to want the government to say no social [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2177.6000000000004s)]
*  media for 13 year olds, anybody under, because as a parent, it's a struggle because every [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2181.68s)]
*  parent sitting here, like if we could get a mole around a table and say none until 13, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2186.72s)]
*  then I can say it because you don't want your kid to be the only kid in school that doesn't [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2191.04s)]
*  have it that has an emotional effect on them as well. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2194.08s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2196.7999999999997s)]
*  In fact, I would say, you know, you've got to parse the platform. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2197.3599999999997s)]
*  But when you look at a lot of these most insidious sort of things on the platform, I would say [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2200.8799999999997s)]
*  it may be 16 or 18 on some of these things. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2206.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2208.16s)]
*  And it's not just the social aspects of it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2208.64s)]
*  I think you have to look even deeper where, you know, you talk about like triggering content, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2210.56s)]
*  surfacing, things like that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2214.96s)]
*  But there's other things you look at in terms of like the way products get designed where [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2216.08s)]
*  so much of what's affecting teenagers is how these platforms prey on social hierarchy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2220.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2225.84s)]
*  So we all went through this of like, oh, were you with the end crowd or not? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2226.4s)]
*  Like, you know, think about that in junior high. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2229.52s)]
*  Like, did you make it into the end crowd? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2231.36s)]
*  And that was really hard to go through. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2232.7999999999997s)]
*  You're trying to find your place. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2234.72s)]
*  Well, now, you know, you'll have apps that'll say, oh, I'll show you where you sit in the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2236.3199999999997s)]
*  social hierarchy and, oh, if you're too low in the social hierarchy, not to worry. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2240.8799999999997s)]
*  The way you can improve your status in the social hierarchy is more messaging on our platform. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2246.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  And so I think these kinds of things, you know, those may not be safe at any age, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2252.0s)]
*  but I think some of these things, you know, again, this is why we made the choice that [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2257.2799999999997s)]
*  under 16, no publicly discoverable profiles, private messaging only, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2261.3599999999997s)]
*  because, you know, we view these things as probably not safe below 16. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2265.28s)]
*  And so I think 13 may not even be old enough because if you look at, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2269.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, sort of from a child psychology perspective, the mind is still developing [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2273.6800000000003s)]
*  at that point. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2276.7200000000003s)]
*  So preying on these issues of social hierarchy, you know, showing triggering content, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2277.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, 13 is probably not a good age for that either. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2282.32s)]
*  I say lock them in the closet till they're 18. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2284.5600000000004s)]
*  Do we have time? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2286.48s)]
*  Do we have time for one more question? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2287.6000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2289.44s)]
*  One more. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2289.84s)]
*  There's a gentleman all the way in the back that's been like jumping up and down and I [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  feel bad. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2293.1200000000003s)]
*  So we're going to get him. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2293.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2296.72s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2323.68s)]
*  I talked before about doing well by doing good. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2324.72s)]
*  And this will be one, by the way, that will just give you like a little bit of uplift [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2327.36s)]
*  for humanity, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2330.56s)]
*  So as we've talked about inclusive AI, there's things where we've designed the product, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2331.84s)]
*  you know, things like hair pattern searches and body type ranges and these kinds of things [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2336.96s)]
*  that say, hey, there's not just one image of beauty. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2342.32s)]
*  People shouldn't have to work hard to be seen. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2344.48s)]
*  We've also done things like diversity by default in our product. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2346.72s)]
*  And back to that, like, make you feel good about humanity. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2350.24s)]
*  We actually found that diversity by default in our feeds was higher engagement across [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2353.52s)]
*  user types. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2359.52s)]
*  So it's not just that people want to see more people like themselves. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2360.56s)]
*  People want to see results that reflect the population and all the beauty of all the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2364.16s)]
*  different kinds of people that are in the population. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2369.04s)]
*  And so we remain deeply committed to, you know, how we, you know, how we drive diversity, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2371.9199999999996s)]
*  how we serve the diverse population on our platform well through things like diversity [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2379.2s)]
*  by default, things like inclusive AI. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2384.72s)]
*  And it's another example where like you can build a good business by doing the right thing [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  and users actually find it more engaging. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2393.3599999999997s)]
*  And we've seen that with these specific features, you know, things like, you know, hair pattern [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2396.56s)]
*  searches and skin tone ranges and these kinds of things, they are some of our highest resonating [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2402.56s)]
*  user features. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2408.0s)]
*  And so again, you know, there's some of these things that like, you know, regulation can [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2409.2s)]
*  be a baseline. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2413.44s)]
*  But I think it's so much better. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2415.04s)]
*  Why can't we prove there's a good business in doing the right thing? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2417.36s)]
*  And this is a great example of it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMUcYI4W2gg&t=2420.48s)]
