# OpenAI VP on Competing with Deepseek, How ChatGPT ‘Reasons’ and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o)
*  So Srinivas, let's just start with the definition of reasoning and why it matters for the enterprises [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=0.0s)]
*  here in the room that AI models are capable of reasoning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=7.8s)]
*  What is OpenAI's definition of reasoning and why does it matter to a corporate enterprise? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=11.02s)]
*  Yeah, so reasoning fundamentally is the ability for AI systems to think longer and solve more [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=16.4s)]
*  complex problems, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=25.52s)]
*  So if you ask a human a very simple question, we almost immediately give you an answer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=27.52s)]
*  If you ask you a hard math question, you can't give an answer immediately. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=33.28s)]
*  You may have to think much longer about this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=36.92s)]
*  You might have to reason through this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=38.92s)]
*  And so fundamentally, the ability for an AI system to do that and take more complex tasks [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=41.56s)]
*  and think longer and be able to evaluate whether it's on the right track, that's what we call [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  as reasoning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=51.16s)]
*  Is reasoning also what puts us onto the path to artificial general intelligence or AGI, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=52.88s)]
*  which OpenAI has talked a lot about? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=58.56s)]
*  What does that mean and is reasoning on the path towards it? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=60.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=63.96s)]
*  I mean, I think the word AGI has lots of different interpretations and meanings, but one way [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  we have talked about it is that the ability for AI to solve economically valuable tasks, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=69.72s)]
*  right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=76.08s)]
*  And so there are a lot of tasks in the world that are important for us as a society and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=77.08s)]
*  to do them, you need to be able to handle complex tasks and think through problems deeper. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  So absolutely, I think it's on the path. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=86.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=88.08s)]
*  So one of the things that we've talked about earlier today is this idea of AI agents and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=89.08s)]
*  OpenAI. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=93.2s)]
*  You've released your own AI agents, one of which is called Operator, which is an agent [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=94.2s)]
*  that can use a computer on behalf of humans and another called Deep Research, which generated [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=99.44s)]
*  a lot of excitement for its ability to do information research on behalf of humans. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=103.72s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about how those agents have been used amongst your customers and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=108.76s)]
*  the people who use Chai GPT. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=113.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=116.04s)]
*  First, I would just also say that we've talked about agents, but really zooming back, this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=117.04s)]
*  is just an incredible time that we are living through in technology. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=122.68s)]
*  And I think we've been talking about AI as being one of the most, it's probably the biggest [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  technological transformation of our lifetimes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=132.4s)]
*  But I do think this year especially is going to showcase that in a very profound way. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=135.08s)]
*  And just to give you an example before I answer a question, we recently launched O1 and then [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=140.36s)]
*  O3 Mini. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=147.0s)]
*  And more recently, we even showed how the model thinks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=148.34s)]
*  Like we improved what we call the chain of thought summarizer. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  And when you look at the model and when you pose it a complex, say a math problem or a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=154.84s)]
*  science problem, and then you look at the responses and you see how it's thinking through [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=158.68s)]
*  this, like you get goosebumps sometimes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=163.4s)]
*  And I think that's just like, it's so magical to be able to have these AI systems that are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=166.68s)]
*  thinking through complex problems. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  So I just want to say it's just incredibly exciting. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=172.56s)]
*  And to answer your question how people are using this, I'll give you a few examples. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=177.24s)]
*  So I think there's a company, Oscar Health, that is using it to understand patient outcomes [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=182.84s)]
*  in a much better way through reasoning models. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=189.22s)]
*  It's using the operator agent? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  No, it's actually using our fundamental O1 model. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=193.84s)]
*  I'll come to operator and deep research in a second. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=197.04s)]
*  But one way you can think of operator and deep research is like there is a base reasoning [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=199.76s)]
*  model. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=203.92s)]
*  Our latest one is O3 Mini. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=204.92s)]
*  We started with O1 and then that will continue. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=206.28s)]
*  And then things like operator and deep research are things that are kind of built on top and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=208.84s)]
*  that are specialized for those specific tasks. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=212.88s)]
*  I'm going to start with the base reasoning models and how they're used and then we can [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=215.68s)]
*  talk specifically about operator and deep research. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=219.04s)]
*  So O1 is used by Oscar Health that I mentioned. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=221.04s)]
*  Reasoning models are also used in biosciences. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=225.92s)]
*  So there's really interesting use by a company for doing better estimation of clinical trial [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=228.84s)]
*  outcomes so that then they're using that answer to figure out which drugs to put out for drug [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  discovery. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=240.72s)]
*  There's an amazing example from Berkeley National Lab where they are trying to use reasoning [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=241.72s)]
*  models to understand what genes may be or what mutated genes may be causing these symptoms [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=246.24s)]
*  for rare diseases. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=254.28s)]
*  So these are incredibly powerful examples where reasoning models are helping us in these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=256.12s)]
*  really difficult and complex problems for us to solve. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=259.68s)]
*  There's also use for it beyond healthcare in areas like tax analysis. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=263.04s)]
*  And so it's quite varied. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=268.44s)]
*  I think we're seeing this use for strategizing through problems. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=270.04s)]
*  We are using it for researching problems. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=273.44s)]
*  We're using it for coding. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=275.84s)]
*  We'll come to maybe later. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=276.84s)]
*  And yeah, so there's a very wide set of uses. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  So that's sort of how people are using reasoning models. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=281.88s)]
*  Now we're using reasoning for also a couple of examples you talked about, deep research, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  which we launched fairly recently and then operator. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Deep research is the system where you can take a reasoning model and try to do tasks [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=293.0s)]
*  that you might want to do advanced research. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=298.64s)]
*  Maybe you are analyzing the finances of a company or of an entire sector. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  And we typically do searches. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=305.04s)]
*  We click through documents. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  We read through documents. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  We look for certain pieces of information. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  We put that in and we try to summarize it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  We might do follow-up searches. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=314.04s)]
*  So now we have these AI models that is capable of automating this on our behalf. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  And one analogy you can think about is that a human might take several hours to complete [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=320.36s)]
*  these tasks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=328.04s)]
*  Typically, if I ask you for, tell me how the retail industry has changed in the last decade, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=329.04s)]
*  that's not a very obvious task. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=335.0s)]
*  You're probably going to spend hours coming up with a research report. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  Now we have models that are capable of doing that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=339.68s)]
*  And it's probably going to finish that in order of minutes and come back with you with [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  an answer. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=346.08s)]
*  So that, I think, is an incredibly powerful tool. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=347.08s)]
*  Operator is another example where we can now have AI systems that can operate on our behalf [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=350.12s)]
*  within a browser context. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=356.28s)]
*  So if you want to make a reservation at a restaurant for this weekend, but you kind [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=357.52s)]
*  of know what you want, and then say, make me a restaurant reservation for a Mexican [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=362.3s)]
*  restaurant this weekend, it knows to go search OpenTable. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=368.1s)]
*  It knows what you like. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=371.14s)]
*  It's like, oh, is this available? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=372.14s)]
*  And it can automate that on our behalf. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=373.22s)]
*  You can keep through links and things. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think that's, we have deployed these and I think it's still early days and we're [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=376.14s)]
*  going to learn a lot from how people are using it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=381.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=384.1s)]
*  One of the things that you mentioned in terms of the excitement of working in AI at this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=385.1s)]
*  period of time that I want to ask you about is the emergence of DeepSeek, the Chinese [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=389.82s)]
*  AI firm and its own R1 model, which is a reasoning model. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  And this idea that there's a lot of downward pressure on sort of foundation models across [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=400.7s)]
*  the board because supposedly DeepSeek's R1 model was trained for just a few million dollars [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  supposedly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=411.94s)]
*  And so what does the release of a model like DeepSeek's R1 mean for your own 0.1, 0.3, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=413.32s)]
*  0.3 mini reasoning models? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=419.2s)]
*  And is there a price pressure for you? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=421.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think what DeepSeek showed is that you can actually have a good model for, in [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=424.0s)]
*  more cost-effective ways than the current generation of models we had launched before. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=430.68s)]
*  But I would say it's just the technology trend that is, they've showed another point in that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=435.24s)]
*  trend. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=439.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=440.32s)]
*  Over the last few years, the price of a GPT-4R model has come down 150 times within a matter [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=442.32s)]
*  of a couple of years. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=448.88s)]
*  And so you're going to see a continuous trend in which highly capable models are going to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=450.88s)]
*  continue to get cheaper. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=456.4s)]
*  And DeepSeek, I think, had some innovations there, and they demonstrated another point [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=458.08s)]
*  in that price capability curve. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=461.28s)]
*  And we're going to continue our trends, and you're going to see our models getting cheaper [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=464.68s)]
*  as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=468.08s)]
*  I think what they proved is that this trend is going to continue, and you're going to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  see us and other companies probably also do that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=472.4s)]
*  One of the things that you've said in response to DeepSeek is that you are investigating [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=475.56s)]
*  whether DeepSeek used or distilled your training data, your models, in creating its own model [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  or its own chatbot. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  So what is the status of that investigation? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=488.44s)]
*  Are you still looking into whether that was the case? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=490.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're still looking into it, and we are evaluating it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  I think we don't have anything concrete to share. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=495.24s)]
*  Depending on the evaluations, we might be able to share something later. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  But more importantly, I think the important trend is that we're going to continue to have [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=502.2s)]
*  amazing models at much lower price points than before. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=507.12s)]
*  And there's also this general trend about distillation. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=510.72s)]
*  Distillation means you can build a smaller model that can learn from a larger model. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  And we have distillation actually as a feature in our own platform end-to-end. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  So this is not the first time we can actually fine tune a mini model on top of, for example, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=523.92s)]
*  a photo model. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  And you can do that end-to-end in our platform. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=531.88s)]
*  And that means that companies can get highly capable models for their specific tasks at [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=533.7199999999999s)]
*  much lower price points than before. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=539.12s)]
*  And so I think that as a trend you're going to continue to see, and you're going to continue [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=541.68s)]
*  to see that on reasoning models too. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  And one of the most amazing things is that we have this now process called reinforcement [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  fine tuning that can take the same reasoning technologies that we have used to develop [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=550.8s)]
*  our own models. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  And we are offering that to our customers to be able to fine tune smaller models for [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  their specific tasks using the same reasoning technology. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=564.52s)]
*  So I think the trend about all of this kind of points to that, right, which is that you [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=566.9799999999999s)]
*  can get smaller models that are cost effective for specific tasks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=570.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think this may resonate for a lot of the enterprises in the room. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=574.5999999999999s)]
*  To what extent will costs come down for your reasoning models, for your most powerful models? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=577.16s)]
*  You talk about how the costs for some of them have come down at least 150 times, but there's [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=582.8199999999999s)]
*  still quite a ways to go, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=587.24s)]
*  So how much cheaper can they get? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=588.92s)]
*  I think I would just use the historic trend. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=590.8s)]
*  I think generally I would say in a given year the price has come down probably 10x for a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=593.16s)]
*  similar capability. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=596.92s)]
*  I mean, there's lots of innovation that happens, both when we build next generation models, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=597.92s)]
*  but also in how we optimize these models to run more efficiently on a GPU fleet. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=604.12s)]
*  And I think that trend is going to continue. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=609.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=611.12s)]
*  I want to ask you about Stargate, which is this supposed $500 billion venture, this joint [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=612.12s)]
*  venture that you announced with President Trump alongside SoftBank and Oracle at the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=617.84s)]
*  White House. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=622.8s)]
*  Why does OpenAI need all of this compute? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=624.4s)]
*  And the answer may be obvious. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=627.52s)]
*  You may be saying, well, you should know this. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=628.52s)]
*  Can you tell the audience why you need so much compute and what that will enable? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=631.64s)]
*  Maybe it's better reasoning models. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=636.04s)]
*  Maybe it's AGI. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  What is it for? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=639.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a couple of dimensions. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  One is in order to advance intelligence, we know that there are certain scaling laws, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=642.3599999999999s)]
*  right, which is you apply more compute, you apply more data, and also there's, of course, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=647.88s)]
*  algorithmic innovations. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=652.4s)]
*  We can continue to get better models which are more intelligent, and we have unlocked [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  two different dimensions of scaling. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=658.7600000000001s)]
*  The first dimension of scaling is what we used to have in the GPT era, where you're [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=660.7600000000001s)]
*  training these large language models. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  And the second dimension is we unlocked is you can apply more compute during what we [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=668.0s)]
*  call as inference, when you're asking questions and the model is responding. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=671.6400000000001s)]
*  And that is another dimension with which we can scale models. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=675.6s)]
*  So first, we believe that with more compute, you can continue to build better, more advanced [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=678.2s)]
*  intelligent models. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  The second is, once you have, and we talked about the cost of these models coming down, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=684.16s)]
*  what that means is that the opportunities for building applications and to deliver benefits [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=690.8399999999999s)]
*  is just enormous. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=696.24s)]
*  Every time cost comes down, you're enabling an entirely new series of applications that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=697.24s)]
*  is more affordable for people all over the world. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=701.92s)]
*  So a huge part of what we need in the infrastructure is also to be able to deploy these models [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=704.4s)]
*  for all the various applications that, incredible applications that people are building. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  So I think in some ways, this revolution is going to be very profound, much like electricity [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=713.6s)]
*  maybe 120 years ago. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=718.88s)]
*  And so I think we need a lot of infrastructure to be able to really deliver the benefits [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=721.4s)]
*  of AI to all of humanity. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=725.0s)]
*  So is it really on the inference side, the using the model side, that sort of the AI [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=726.76s)]
*  usage will move to? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=732.28s)]
*  And I also wonder, did Deepsea kind of, at least I think to the news media and a lot [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  Silicon Valley, made us think that, you know, did we over index on the GPU side? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=739.36s)]
*  Did we try to mass too many graphics processing units and we all saw what happened in this [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=743.92s)]
*  sort of market correction with Nvidia? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=748.76s)]
*  So are you saying that is it on the inference side? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=750.64s)]
*  No, it's both on training and inference. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=752.64s)]
*  I think I mentioned that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=754.72s)]
*  It is not just on inference. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=755.72s)]
*  It's both on training and inference. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=756.72s)]
*  I think the market correction is over exaggerated. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=757.92s)]
*  I also think it's important to realize that there is a lot of research that goes behind [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=761.0s)]
*  the scenes before you train a model. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=766.04s)]
*  And sometimes when you talk about the cost of training a model, you have to include the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=769.28s)]
*  entire cost of all the different research experiments you're running. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=773.56s)]
*  And that gets lost sometimes in the headlines. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  And so in order to lead, there's an enormous amount of research that goes behind the scenes. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=780.0s)]
*  It's not the final, you do like a hundred experiments before you decide which experiment [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=784.68s)]
*  you want to proceed on. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=788.92s)]
*  And so those don't get accounted for in some of these headlines. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=789.92s)]
*  So is it feasible that DeepSeq trained its model on just a few million dollars? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=794.64s)]
*  Is that what we're talking about? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=798.88s)]
*  So I think there is a very different question about what does it take to run a single run [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=799.88s)]
*  versus what does it take to have a system that can continuously produce research innovation. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=804.04s)]
*  So is that a no maybe? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=810.08s)]
*  I can't speak for them because I don't have insights into how everything was done, but [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=812.64s)]
*  I'm giving you an insight from how in general the research works. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  And then there's a very different system for, there is a lot of research that happens behind [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=821.14s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=825.24s)]
*  And then when you train a single model, the cost of that single model, yeah, that could [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=826.24s)]
*  be very different, but you have to add all of this in aggregate. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=829.66s)]
*  I want to ask you a question about the sort of engineering challenges around being at [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=832.78s)]
*  such a sort of important AI company at this pivotal period of time. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=839.1s)]
*  When you're building for these hard problems, like the enterprises that want to use your [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=843.62s)]
*  products as well as the consumers, the millions of consumers who are using your products. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=848.58s)]
*  I also wonder if all the headlines, especially the latest around Elon Musk providing this [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=853.0200000000001s)]
*  takeover bid to the tune of $97.4 billion for open AI, does that become a distraction [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  to you? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=864.86s)]
*  It's something that we heard Brett Taylor, the chairman of your board, talk about earlier [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=865.86s)]
*  today. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  How do you stay focused on building and solving for the hard challenges when there's so much [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=870.0600000000001s)]
*  going on around you? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=874.2600000000001s)]
*  I'll focus on the engineering challenges. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=876.26s)]
*  I think Brett and Sam have answered the other question about Elon already, and I can just [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=878.22s)]
*  repeat their answer. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=883.26s)]
*  The mission or the company is not for sale. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=884.26s)]
*  The engineering challenges are actually incredibly exciting, right? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=888.18s)]
*  And so obviously there's a lot of interesting challenges in how we build models, how do [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=891.14s)]
*  we scale these models, and every new model has a new scalability limit that we are hitting [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=895.5s)]
*  on infrastructure. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=901.54s)]
*  So there's enormous amounts of engineering challenges and training models. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=902.54s)]
*  Really interesting challenges in how do you optimize inference, how do you bring costs [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=905.62s)]
*  down. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=909.2199999999999s)]
*  But there's also enormous engineering challenges for us in deploying these products at scale. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=910.2199999999999s)]
*  Our products have grown just incredibly fast and probably one of the fastest growing products [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=916.62s)]
*  in the history. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=921.14s)]
*  If not, it's probably the fastest growing product. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=922.14s)]
*  So that means how do you prepare your engineering organization to scale? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=924.14s)]
*  There's also interesting challenges because once you take AI and deploy it in the real [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=928.06s)]
*  world, it has to learn to interact with all the systems that people care about. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=931.26s)]
*  It has to interact with the various applications that are in an enterprise. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=935.78s)]
*  It has to understand the unique data sets that enterprises have, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=939.26s)]
*  And so there is a lot of engineering innovation that we also have to build in enabling the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  AI to understand applications, understand documents and all of those things. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  And I think there is going to be tremendous amount of innovation and opportunity in doing [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=950.02s)]
*  that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=954.26s)]
*  And as we prepare for an agentic future, how do you enable enterprises to automate workflows [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=955.26s)]
*  using this agentic technology? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=960.54s)]
*  What are the primitives that we need to build? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=962.0999999999999s)]
*  How do we make it as simple as possible? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=963.3399999999999s)]
*  How do we make it cost effective? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  I think there's a fascinating engineering challenges. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=967.02s)]
*  So can we expect to see more product innovation directly from open AI in that regard where [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  you have specific sectors like healthcare or legal or retail that have very different [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=974.74s)]
*  uses for your technology, though you've often talked about it as a sort of general wear [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=980.38s)]
*  everything for everyone. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=985.5s)]
*  But do you expect to build more specific, maybe vertical tools, for instance? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=986.7s)]
*  So we are enabling lots of other people to do that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=991.7s)]
*  And what we are generally doing is building the tools that enable other people to build [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=995.5s)]
*  all these applications. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=999.42s)]
*  And the set of tools that we will build will be very general in nature, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1001.18s)]
*  It will enable a healthcare company, enable a financial company to take our models, take [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1005.1s)]
*  our tools and figure out how to integrate it within and then build these amazing applications [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1010.94s)]
*  on top of them. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1015.14s)]
*  But what about for the companies that need something more from you? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1016.9399999999999s)]
*  Do you expect that you might release something like a bespoke tool or something more custom? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1019.74s)]
*  I think customization is a very big part of our strategy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1024.66s)]
*  And we have already launched a whole suite of customization tools for enabling companies [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1027.42s)]
*  to customize GPT-40, for example. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1032.22s)]
*  And more recently, we launched this tool called reinforcement fine tuning, which is incredibly [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1035.46s)]
*  exciting, right? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1039.74s)]
*  Which is that with this new reasoning paradigm, if you can express certain workflows or tasks [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1040.74s)]
*  in your company and provide a way to evaluate the answer, you can now build customized models [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1046.1399999999999s)]
*  that can learn from that with very, very few examples. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1052.9399999999998s)]
*  Sometimes it's just on the order of tens of examples. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1056.98s)]
*  That is a very profound shift from the previous era of customization. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1059.74s)]
*  The previous era, you need thousands, maybe even more. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1062.98s)]
*  But now with very few examples, the reasoning models generalize really well. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1065.98s)]
*  I think that is enormously exciting. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1069.98s)]
*  Basically, the fundamental primitive is take any task, figure out how you want to think [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1071.74s)]
*  through it, and find a way to evaluate it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1076.3400000000001s)]
*  If you can express your jobs to be done or if you can express your problem in that way, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1078.54s)]
*  you're going to have AI that is going to be amazing at it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  And that is just a fundamentally amazing primitive for us to have. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1086.46s)]
*  I want to ask about the amazing AI you have and ask about the importance of it being proprietary, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1089.22s)]
*  that it's sort of locked behind closed doors rather than open source. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1095.26s)]
*  And I know that you do open source some of your models. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1098.54s)]
*  But not too long after the release of DeepSeq's R1 model, your CEO Sam Altman said that we [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1101.1s)]
*  may be on the wrong side of history here. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1106.4599999999998s)]
*  Maybe we need a new open source strategy. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1108.06s)]
*  So I wonder, what do you make of that statement? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1110.26s)]
*  Does it mean that you do need to start open sourcing 01, 03? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1114.1399999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1119.02s)]
*  Yeah, we are having internal discussions. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1120.02s)]
*  And I think we've always, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1121.86s)]
*  One is that when we talk to our customers, it's not just about whether a model is open [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1130.58s)]
*  source. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1134.86s)]
*  They care about an entire ecosystem. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1135.86s)]
*  They care about having models that are very high quality of service, that is cost effective, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1136.86s)]
*  that is easy to use, that is customizable. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1140.82s)]
*  And I think for our mission to deliver benefits to humanity, we believe that building those [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1143.1399999999999s)]
*  products is also really, really important. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1146.6599999999999s)]
*  In addition to that, I think as Sam said, we're going to have internal discussions on [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1149.98s)]
*  whether we want to rethink any of them. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1153.82s)]
*  Historically, we've always been worried about the safety of our frontier models being open [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1156.22s)]
*  source because it's very hard to understand the risk and the different ways in which people [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1160.98s)]
*  can use them. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1166.14s)]
*  And so as we learn more, we're going to learn and adapt our strategy as well. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1167.54s)]
*  But to come back to what maybe enterprises care about, it's not just about whether the [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1171.74s)]
*  model or the weights are open source. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1176.14s)]
*  They care about actually having an amazing product that is easy to use and can solve [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1177.56s)]
*  their problem, that that's cost effective. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1181.26s)]
*  And that's what we hear consistently and we're going to continue building that too. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1183.16s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  I want to make sure that we have time for audience questions here and I see quite a few. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  I think Larry, you were one of the first to raise your hand. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1191.4s)]
*  The gentleman back there actually. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1198.8400000000001s)]
*  Go ahead, Larry. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  Thank you for what you do. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1200.8400000000001s)]
*  Amazing time. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1203.72s)]
*  A year and a half or so ago, Meta released Cicero, which basically is a game, plays a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1204.72s)]
*  game of diplomacy. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1212.32s)]
*  They injected customized strategic reasoning with language models to play the game. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1213.6399999999999s)]
*  It plays quite well. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1219.6s)]
*  My question is how far away are we from a time when mere mortal companies like ours [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1221.24s)]
*  or mine can take our own specialized reasoning models and deploy them with a tool like yours [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1230.24s)]
*  and get not in the domain of game playing but in our domain, similar kinds of capabilities, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1238.62s)]
*  like real agent behavior that has embodied our proprietary logic for doing fairly complicated [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1245.1799999999998s)]
*  tasks? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1250.4199999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1251.4199999999998s)]
*  I actually think this is the time. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1252.4199999999998s)]
*  Our reinforcement fine tuning product should enable exactly the use cases that you're talking [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1255.5s)]
*  about, which is every business, every enterprise has a very custom task. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1261.06s)]
*  You have a certain thought process. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1265.34s)]
*  If you can objectively figure out how to evaluate the thought process, we now have [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1267.54s)]
*  generalizable models that can learn that very quickly. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1272.34s)]
*  I would absolutely try that and experiment with it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1275.5s)]
*  Yes, in the blue. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1278.78s)]
*  Hi, Srinivas. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1281.78s)]
*  This is Madhu. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1282.78s)]
*  Hi. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1283.78s)]
*  Question to you. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1284.78s)]
*  When do you build an operator-like model to build the application itself? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1285.78s)]
*  Will you move into the application side? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1288.58s)]
*  If so, what is the time frame? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1291.02s)]
*  Can you repeat the question? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1295.02s)]
*  Like the operator is doing the operating the thing, when will you come with a model which [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1296.18s)]
*  will actually build the app itself, the SaaS applications? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1299.5s)]
*  I think there's ... One is that the quality of the coding models that we have is improving [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1303.94s)]
*  quite a bit. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1309.44s)]
*  Today people are using assistive coding for all kinds of software, both within their IDEs [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1311.3s)]
*  but also even within ChatGPT, we have the ability to create lightweight applications. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1318.1s)]
*  You can create JavaScript. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1323.06s)]
*  You can create simple websites. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1324.06s)]
*  I think the technology to create simple applications very easily is already there. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1326.0s)]
*  And as the complexity of ... As the reasoning capabilities of the models improve, you should [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1330.48s)]
*  be able to use them to create more and more complex applications on your behalf. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1336.24s)]
*  I think one of the areas where we will see reasoning models deployed is in the area of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1339.56s)]
*  coding. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1344.28s)]
*  As that complexity or that reasoning quality improves, you should be able to create more [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1345.28s)]
*  complex applications fairly easily. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1349.76s)]
*  Yes, Satish. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1351.76s)]
*  We're going to have a mic runner up heading your way. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1353.52s)]
*  Srimas, thank you. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1358.04s)]
*  Exciting times indeed. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1361.24s)]
*  I work in a financial institution organization. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1363.68s)]
*  One of the slight roadblocks for broad adoption and adaptability of OpenAI is the question [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1366.4s)]
*  of explainability. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1373.56s)]
*  I'm excited to hear you talk about chain of thought. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1374.56s)]
*  Can you expand on it and see how we can adopt it? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1379.04s)]
*  I think the chain of thought is basically the inner monologue. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1381.92s)]
*  In some ways, you can think about it. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1389.0800000000002s)]
*  If I ask you a complex question, you're thinking through it and coming up with an answer. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1390.44s)]
*  That monologue that goes through in the model is what we call as the chain of thought. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1396.24s)]
*  That is basically the reasoning process that it is using to come up with an answer. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1399.96s)]
*  Most recently, we used to summarize those chains of thoughts and then provide them as [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1404.64s)]
*  summarize COTs in the product. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1408.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, we have expanded on them and you can get a lot more insight into what the chain [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1411.32s)]
*  of thought process looks like. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1415.24s)]
*  I actually think it's one of the most powerful tools for explainability, which is people [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1416.64s)]
*  have always asked, how are you coming up with these answers? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1420.8s)]
*  This is how I thought about the problem. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1424.56s)]
*  Here's how we evaluated it and here's why I think it's the right answer. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1426.64s)]
*  I think it is a very big step forward to helping people have answers around explainability. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1430.32s)]
*  And Shavim. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1437.24s)]
*  Shavim Mohammed with Carmex, CIO and CTO. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1440.92s)]
*  We've been a very early adopter of OpenAI, a big fan of it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1445.28s)]
*  We're using OpenAI, Chatchat, GPD before people knew what OpenAI, Chatchat, GPD was, so it's [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1449.48s)]
*  been cool. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1453.28s)]
*  We have a lot of different tools and applications within the company. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1454.28s)]
*  Some are customer-facing, some are internal. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1458.04s)]
*  One primary question or concern we have still to work through is, how do we make sure the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1460.52s)]
*  proprietary information we have, proprietary data we have, the knowledge we have from a [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1466.2s)]
*  security perspective, we're not using that to make the model smarter that's available [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1469.72s)]
*  to others, right? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1473.64s)]
*  That's one thing that we have to walk the fine line and balance it because obviously [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1474.64s)]
*  we got that knowledge for over 30 years that differentiates us. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1480.88s)]
*  We don't want to give that same knowledge and train a model the competitor might be [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1484.68s)]
*  able to take advantage of. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1487.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1488.92s)]
*  We take this super seriously and for all of our enterprise and teams customers and for [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1489.92s)]
*  API, we do not train on your data. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1495.24s)]
*  And so that's a promise that we have made and you should have complete confidence. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1499.06s)]
*  We are happy to work with you and tell you how things work, but basically, yeah, we do [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1503.3799999999999s)]
*  not train on our customers' data. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1507.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1509.02s)]
*  I think we have time for one, maybe two more questions. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1510.02s)]
*  I think over here we have one. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1513.78s)]
*  The gentleman in the jacket. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1515.94s)]
*  Hi, Stephen Carvele. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1518.1799999999998s)]
*  Question for you around operator. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1521.52s)]
*  What's generally next? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1523.58s)]
*  Because it's such a, it's one of the capabilities from the agent standpoint we've all looked [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1525.74s)]
*  forward to and there's just a myriad of use cases obviously. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1530.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's super exciting. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1535.74s)]
*  I think we want to iteratively learn how people are using it. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1538.6599999999999s)]
*  We want to, the confidence in the model's abilities to do certain actions. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  When does it check with you? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1550.34s)]
*  I mean, today we have restrictions and guardrails on if you want to, before paying something, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1551.4599999999998s)]
*  I want to ask you for confirmation, right? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1556.1s)]
*  So I think there's just a wide variety of use cases that we expect people to use it [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1559.4199999999998s)]
*  for and deploy it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1563.8999999999999s)]
*  But then since it's early enough, we also want to learn iteratively on how well it's [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1565.36s)]
*  working in all these use cases. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1568.9399999999998s)]
*  More broadly, what you can imagine is that the quality of the models is going to improve. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1571.3s)]
*  You're going to build more trust with the models. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1576.62s)]
*  You're going to build trust because you also expect it to confirm with you on when you [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1579.26s)]
*  want you to provide input versus have the model go do its things. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1584.62s)]
*  And these are things we're going to learn and iterate. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1588.82s)]
*  And more broadly, the operator should not just work in a browser. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1591.22s)]
*  It should probably be able to handle an entire computer or any different environment. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1595.34s)]
*  So I think there's lots of other dimensions that it's going to grow into as well. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1599.14s)]
*  So it's still a business for human inclusion? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1601.98s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1605.02s)]
*  We wanted to operate on your behalf with your consent and with your preferences, absolutely. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1606.02s)]
*  Well, I have one final question for you, Srinivas. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1611.74s)]
*  I know that most, if not all, the folks in this room have used Chad GPT or some version [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1615.3s)]
*  of GPT. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1620.1s)]
*  How does OpenAI use its own products? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1621.42s)]
*  How do you use Chad GPT or any version of your APIs? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1624.66s)]
*  Yeah, we use it for lots of different things. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1627.54s)]
*  As an engineer, I'll start with that and then I'll talk about the other functions. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1629.78s)]
*  We'll make it quick because I threw this question in at the end. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1633.1399999999999s)]
*  Engineers, we use it for coding as a coding assistant. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1636.1799999999998s)]
*  We use it to find bugs in our code. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1639.54s)]
*  We have lots of Slack channels where people ask questions about certain technologies or [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1642.22s)]
*  certain APIs. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1646.34s)]
*  And we have automated assistants that help answer these questions. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1648.1399999999999s)]
*  Knowledge sharing internally, there's always projects going around in a company. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1653.54s)]
*  And like, oh, what is that project? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1656.58s)]
*  How do I learn more about it? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1657.58s)]
*  We have a tool that does that. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1659.3799999999999s)]
*  So you can just go, what does project X mean? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1661.34s)]
*  And it'll give you a nice summary. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1663.14s)]
*  And beyond engineering, we have our finance team use it for, you know, we do lots of legal [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1665.46s)]
*  contracts with various vendors. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1672.66s)]
*  They use these models to analyze these contracts and like see if there are any subtle things [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1674.7s)]
*  we should know about. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1678.74s)]
*  We use it for customer service and answering questions inbound and automating that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1680.42s)]
*  So it's just used all across. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1685.7s)]
*  I think that may be refreshing for some of the folks in the room because that's also [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1687.46s)]
*  what they're using AI for. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1690.82s)]
*  So thanks so much for your time. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1692.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-t1Pg3eX4o&t=1694.22s)]
