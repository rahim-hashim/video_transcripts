# F1's James Vowles on Williams Racing, How to Win in Formula 1 and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0)
*  James, you've been in Formula One for over 20 years at this point, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=0.0s)]
*  a pretty crazy, transformative time for this sport. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=4.0s)]
*  You spent the bulk of that time at Mercedes, the very pinnacle of it, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=7.0s)]
*  eight world championships in a row, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=12.0s)]
*  and in 2023 you moved to Williams for a very different kind of challenge, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=14.0s)]
*  a bit closer to the back of the grid. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=19.0s)]
*  How do you make that shift when you're thrown in the deep end? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=20.0s)]
*  So I had the privilege and honor to really be part of an organization and a team [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=24.0s)]
*  that did everything you can almost do in a sporting world. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=28.0s)]
*  We won everything that there was to win. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=31.0s)]
*  And it became an organization where we were really just fine-tuning small details of it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=35.0s)]
*  And I'm built slightly differently. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=40.0s)]
*  I'm someone that really enjoyed the journey when we were building down to foundations [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=43.0s)]
*  and changing almost the world through what we were doing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=47.0s)]
*  And when I get to the point where I just feel as I were into the detail, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=50.0s)]
*  that's the point for me of which I need to start finding a new challenge that pushes me on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=54.0s)]
*  And at the end of 22, really, I felt it was a natural, organic way [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=58.0s)]
*  to either change significantly what I was doing within Mercedes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=62.0s)]
*  or go and really establish myself elsewhere in a new challenge. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=65.0s)]
*  And it was very organic. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=70.0s)]
*  There was a call with Williams that took place. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=72.0s)]
*  There was, for transparency, a call with three other teams, actually. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=74.0s)]
*  It was just coincidence that took place. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=76.0s)]
*  But Williams and myself just gelled. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=78.0s)]
*  It's an organization that, hopefully, may or may not know this, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=80.0s)]
*  but Williams today is the second most successful team on the grid. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=85.0s)]
*  That isn't Mercedes. That isn't McLaren. It's Williams. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=89.0s)]
*  They have 114 wins to their name, nine championships, seven drivers championships. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=93.0s)]
*  And to have the opportunity to be at the helm of that, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=98.0s)]
*  but not just to be the helm of that, do that with investment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=101.0s)]
*  I put a number on the table and no one blinked. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=105.0s)]
*  I went, okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=108.0s)]
*  To do that, you get once in a lifetime opportunity. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=110.0s)]
*  So it wasn't actually a hard decision. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=113.0s)]
*  It was an easy decision the day I did that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=116.0s)]
*  And when we spoke, you told me that when you first came into Formula One, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=118.0s)]
*  a team was maybe 250, 300 people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=123.0s)]
*  At Mercedes, it was a staff of over 1,000. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=126.0s)]
*  At Williams, you're not far off that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=128.0s)]
*  How can you explain it? How do you manage that kind of expansion? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean, it is mad when you think about it, isn't it? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=135.0s)]
*  It's two racing cars and I've got 1,100 roughly is where it will end up. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=137.0s)]
*  People designing, building that car and operating that car. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=141.0s)]
*  So exactly that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=146.0s)]
*  When I first started, this is now around about the year 2000, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=148.0s)]
*  I was employee number 255. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=151.0s)]
*  And I did everything. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=153.0s)]
*  You sort of worked a little bit in vehicle dynamics, a little bit in aero, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=155.0s)]
*  a little bit in race engineering, a little bit in software, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=158.0s)]
*  a little bit of research and development. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=161.0s)]
*  And I loved it because you got to learn so many different disciplines [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=163.0s)]
*  and you were empowered to do a large amount. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=167.0s)]
*  What happened though is, as you would imagine, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=170.0s)]
*  as the sport grew and it became more and more competitive, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=172.0s)]
*  we also added individuals to the organization in order to get there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=175.0s)]
*  And if you look back, many of you hopefully Google it afterwards, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=179.0s)]
*  a sort of 2000s car, you'll see it's just very straight edges. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=182.0s)]
*  Now go and look and hopefully you can have a look at our car across the weekend [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=186.0s)]
*  and you'll see if there is a straight edge, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=190.0s)]
*  typically I'll come across and get angry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=192.0s)]
*  Nothing should be straight on the car. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=194.0s)]
*  Everything should be aerodynamically driven and complicated. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=196.0s)]
*  And so it's gone from about a thousand components to 20,000 components, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=199.0s)]
*  all designed in-house, nearly all produced in-house. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=203.0s)]
*  And therefore the workforce has increased as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=206.0s)]
*  The second thing that's changed is back in the 2000s, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=208.0s)]
*  it'd be very normal to design a car, produce it, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=211.0s)]
*  and then maybe in the year change it once, maybe not. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=214.0s)]
*  We're now updating the car realistically once every three, four weeks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=217.0s)]
*  That's what you're trying to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=221.0s)]
*  So it's a prototype that you're never staying still. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=222.0s)]
*  And to give you an idea of how significant that is, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=225.0s)]
*  if I took this car here, this Williams here, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=227.0s)]
*  it would have been winning races last year, no doubt about it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=230.0s)]
*  That's the evolution fundamentally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=233.0s)]
*  And we're now in a situation where we're scoring points. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=235.0s)]
*  But if we stop developing this car, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=238.0s)]
*  we'll fall straight back towards the back of the grid. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=241.0s)]
*  You have to, it's a development race, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=243.0s)]
*  it's an arms race between everyone and workforce size to a certain extent, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=245.0s)]
*  including efficiency and automation and software dictates that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=249.0s)]
*  And you're correct. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=253.0s)]
*  We're about now, as I say, about 1,100, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=254.0s)]
*  and that's all part of the size of most teams. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=258.0s)]
*  And that's changed the role of the team principal as well, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=261.0s)]
*  as manager, overseeing the engineering side as well, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=263.0s)]
*  and now kind of reality TV star. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=268.0s)]
*  That's not there yet. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=271.0s)]
*  But you really don't want to see my reality TV. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=273.0s)]
*  It's mostly just trying to deal with a sort of 10-month-old [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=276.0s)]
*  that wants to go her own way. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=279.0s)]
*  But here's what it is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=281.0s)]
*  It is changed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=284.0s)]
*  It used to be managing 250 people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=285.0s)]
*  And for all of those, I know many of you are C-suite out here, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=287.0s)]
*  many of you are executive vice presidents, presidents, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=290.0s)]
*  so you'll know this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=292.0s)]
*  Managing actually an organization of about 250, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=293.0s)]
*  you can do that with one or two people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=296.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=298.0s)]
*  There's about a threshold. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=299.0s)]
*  There's various papers on it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=300.0s)]
*  But it's about 250 actually is a threshold. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=301.0s)]
*  And at that point there, you're done. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=304.0s)]
*  You can't manage it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=305.0s)]
*  And that's what happened to Williams. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=306.0s)]
*  It was run by two really great individuals [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=307.0s)]
*  and sort of grew up to 400 people, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=309.0s)]
*  and it sort of started collapsing as a result of that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=311.0s)]
*  So the secret behind it is that it's not about one person. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=313.0s)]
*  I have a fantastic management committee behind me [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=316.0s)]
*  that are all brilliant to know in arenas. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=319.0s)]
*  We have Fred, who is a CEO, that came from Patent Whitney. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=322.0s)]
*  He ran organizations of 10,000 people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=326.0s)]
*  I have Anne, who came from BP, who was running HR teams [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=328.0s)]
*  that were dealing with oil rigs and others all over the world. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=332.0s)]
*  Again, about 10,000 people, managing 1,000 now today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=335.0s)]
*  And it's sort of a world of change. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=339.0s)]
*  You have to surround yourself by excellence [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=341.0s)]
*  in order to run an organization that way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=343.0s)]
*  And what lessons were you able to bring over from Mercedes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=345.0s)]
*  where you were one of those people who was being delegated to? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=348.0s)]
*  The main thing is this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=352.0s)]
*  It's a little bit for Mercedes, and it's a lot for myself. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=355.0s)]
*  First and foremost, the way I operate, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=358.0s)]
*  the way I am as a human being is about openness and transparency. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=360.0s)]
*  Everything that you hear now today is me as an individual. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=364.0s)]
*  There's no difference or change irrespective of whether it's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=367.0s)]
*  to an audience on camera or to my workforce. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=370.0s)]
*  I believe I'm leading by example. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=374.0s)]
*  There's no point talking words if you're not ready to enact them yourself [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=376.0s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=379.0s)]
*  And the workforce knows that I will wake up at 6 a.m. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=381.0s)]
*  and from that point onwards, every minute is dedicated towards Williams. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=384.0s)]
*  Every minute is dedicated towards us moving forward. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=388.0s)]
*  And when I go to bed at night, the last emails flow out at about 10 p.m. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=391.0s)]
*  That is what I do within my life. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=395.0s)]
*  And I've decided that that's where I want to put everything into it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=397.0s)]
*  And there's sacrifices. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=400.0s)]
*  Sacrifices on the family side and other elements in the world. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=402.0s)]
*  But I'm comfortable with it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=405.0s)]
*  And so I lead by example. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=407.0s)]
*  Fundamentally, I want my managers and I want my, I call them lieutenants. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=409.0s)]
*  It uses an army term, but I think it's a very apt way of describing it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=412.0s)]
*  I have five lieutenants. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=415.0s)]
*  I have five lieutenants they put in place, and that creates the accountability structure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=417.0s)]
*  But they all lead by example. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=420.0s)]
*  Whatever you do is what your workforce will do in response. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=422.0s)]
*  So act in the way that you want them to be. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=425.0s)]
*  That was very much not creating Mercedes, but how I manage there [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=427.0s)]
*  and how our senior management managed together. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=431.0s)]
*  The second one is failure. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=433.0s)]
*  Our business, to give you an idea, I'm asking engineers to completely push [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=435.0s)]
*  the boundaries of engineering. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=439.0s)]
*  It's not aerospace or other areas where you have a five-year development cycle. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=441.0s)]
*  You've got two weeks, two weeks to get this right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=446.0s)]
*  There's no failure that's possible in as much as you have to deliver a product. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=449.0s)]
*  But in doing that, you are going to fail so many times. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=453.0s)]
*  And the really important bit to me is not hiding it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=457.0s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=459.0s)]
*  Anyone that fails in our organization because they're pushing the boundaries, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=460.0s)]
*  because they're innovating, I put on a pedestal. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=462.0s)]
*  It can be in an email that goes out three times a week to the organization. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=465.0s)]
*  It can be actually in person. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=469.0s)]
*  But you demonstrate, here's what we were doing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=471.0s)]
*  Here's why it's just completely changing the game for everyone else. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=474.0s)]
*  Here's why I went wrong, and here's the learning that we're cycling back through it again. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=477.0s)]
*  And the more that you can do that, the more you can demonstrate [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=481.0s)]
*  that the failure element of things is how you become much stronger, not much weaker. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=483.0s)]
*  And no one in my organization will be removed for failure. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=488.0s)]
*  It's quite the opposite. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=491.0s)]
*  If you're there hiding information, then that becomes a problem. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=492.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=495.0s)]
*  And in your workforce, no one is more public, no one is more visible [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=496.0s)]
*  than the two guys who pull on a helmet and squeeze themselves into the cockpits every other Sunday. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=500.0s)]
*  And as a team principal, you had to make one of the toughest calls there is for a team principal this year, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=505.0s)]
*  switching one of your drivers mid-season. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=510.0s)]
*  How do you deal with that, and how do you sort of execute that decision? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=512.0s)]
*  It really was, in my career, the toughest decision I've made. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=516.0s)]
*  Because it's no different, I'm afraid, to removing an individual from your organization. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=521.0s)]
*  It's just this was done to 70 million people watching, or 1.5 billion across the season. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=525.0s)]
*  So it's just a little bit more visibility. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=530.0s)]
*  You can't hide anywhere. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=532.0s)]
*  I'm very data-driven. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=534.0s)]
*  So the decisions I've made, first and foremost, actually, I'll go back to my core, my ethos. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=535.0s)]
*  I was a graduate 30 years ago, and I'm here running an organization of 1,000 people today. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=540.0s)]
*  And I was done because people believed in me, invested in me, and gave me opportunity. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=544.0s)]
*  So in my ethos, in my core, is I believe in investing in future generations. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=549.0s)]
*  Be that graduates or young drivers. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=553.0s)]
*  But you don't just push someone there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=556.0s)]
*  They have to pass first gateways in order to make sure that they have the ability to get there [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=558.0s)]
*  because you're putting an enormous amount of pressure on their shoulders. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=562.0s)]
*  And so young drivers, both in Williams's history and in mine, will always appear, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=565.0s)]
*  and they'll always be there as a part of things. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=570.0s)]
*  And we invest a lot. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=572.0s)]
*  I don't mean just financially. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=574.0s)]
*  It's a lot of financial investment. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=575.0s)]
*  I mean time, effort, through psychological help, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=576.0s)]
*  and just building them up through their career as well. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=579.0s)]
*  So the decision was based on this. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=582.0s)]
*  First half of the year, we did not produce a car that was capable of points at every Grand Prix. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=584.0s)]
*  That is on us, and that is our responsibility. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=590.0s)]
*  So in that circumstance, if I can invest in Logan [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=592.0s)]
*  and give him the best opportunity to prove himself when the car's quick enough, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=595.0s)]
*  I will do it, which is what we did. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=598.0s)]
*  When it got to the point that very clearly we've now changed the car, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=600.0s)]
*  and we're in a situation where we can start fighting for significant championship points, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=604.0s)]
*  but I don't have two drivers delivering, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=608.0s)]
*  at that point I have to, for the sake of a thousand people that give me every minute of their time, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=610.0s)]
*  make a change, because we're not performing at the level we need to. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=615.0s)]
*  This isn't junior anymore. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=618.0s)]
*  This is in a big stage. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=620.0s)]
*  And so that decision came about because I want success for this organization. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=622.0s)]
*  I want success for this team. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=627.0s)]
*  And we're not going to deliver it with what we have there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=629.0s)]
*  And there's something, I'm sure, again, for everyone in this room, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=631.0s)]
*  you've dealt with this within your organizations, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=633.0s)]
*  but an underperforming individual drags down your organization very quickly. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=635.0s)]
*  And so you have to make the change cleanly and execute it in a good way. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=639.0s)]
*  And it's what we did. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=643.0s)]
*  And I was just making sure as well I had a good enough replacement in place. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=645.0s)]
*  Franco, the whole world didn't know his name, I guarantee you, until about a month ago. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=648.0s)]
*  Now he's fairly known. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=653.0s)]
*  But he was very special, just wasn't known to the world. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=656.0s)]
*  So if I take you through what I mean by that, drivers, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=661.0s)]
*  his father sold his house for him to go and do one championship, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=665.0s)]
*  which is the Formula Four championship, which is how I spotted him. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=669.0s)]
*  Many fathers do this, by the way. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=673.0s)]
*  Many families do this. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=675.0s)]
*  They sell all their possessions. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=676.0s)]
*  And it happens every day. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=677.0s)]
*  He won in a team that was not at the right level, but he won. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=679.0s)]
*  And that then opened the door for him. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=684.0s)]
*  In fact, when I was personally racing in something called Asian Le Mans, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=686.0s)]
*  he was also racing at Asian Le Mans, which is how I met him. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=689.0s)]
*  And I realized very swiftly, he is so quick. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=692.0s)]
*  He just drives anything that anyone can give him that he has the opportunity to. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=695.0s)]
*  Then we put him into our simulator. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=699.0s)]
*  He did thousands of kilometers, put him into Formula Two, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=700.0s)]
*  and he started winning races, and then gave him an opportunity in the F1 car in Silverstone. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=703.0s)]
*  And when we did, I was caught off guard. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=708.0s)]
*  I didn't expect what he did in the car. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=710.0s)]
*  And what wasn't visible was he was on the pace of Alex. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=712.0s)]
*  That doesn't happen. It shouldn't happen. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=716.0s)]
*  This is such a step up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=718.0s)]
*  You're going from a Formula Two car, which is hard to drive, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=719.0s)]
*  to a Formula One car that's hyper speed. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=723.0s)]
*  Everything just happens very quickly. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=726.0s)]
*  And he dealt with it admirably. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=728.0s)]
*  So the decision wasn't as hard as you may think. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=730.0s)]
*  It just had to be executed in the right way. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=733.0s)]
*  And I want to say we will have a couple minutes for audience questions at the end. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=736.0s)]
*  So start thinking if you have something. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=739.0s)]
*  But first, F1 is unique in that it's a rare sport that tears up the world book every few years, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=742.0s)]
*  resets everything, and we're heading for that in 2026 with a new set of specifications. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=748.0s)]
*  So it puts you in this position of working on two tracks. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=753.0s)]
*  How do you manage that? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=757.0s)]
*  How do you deal with performing this season, but also preparing for this blank slate? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=758.0s)]
*  Good. Yeah, it is a good question. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=763.0s)]
*  So the agreements I have with my board, and the only reason why I signed to come on, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=765.0s)]
*  is I want us to be successful in 2026, which means it's not that I'm going to give up on 24, 25, or 23, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=769.0s)]
*  but they will be very compromised, very, very compromised. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=777.0s)]
*  So a team of 1,000 people think about it this way. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=780.0s)]
*  Actually, even better. Our Aero workforce is about 50. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=782.0s)]
*  I have five people working on this year and next year. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=786.0s)]
*  45 people are working on 2026. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=789.0s)]
*  A car that is an imagination at the moment more than anything else, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=792.0s)]
*  but it's the right way of doing it for the long-term success of this organization. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=797.0s)]
*  It means we don't have to think short-term anymore. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=802.0s)]
*  We can think long-term. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=804.0s)]
*  The only way you can do that is you have a board and an investment behind you that completely agree [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=805.0s)]
*  that we could be through a few difficult years. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=810.0s)]
*  I mean, for transparency, we're adding large amounts of workforce. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=813.0s)]
*  There's lots of what I call low-hanging fruit, which we're picking up at the moment, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=816.0s)]
*  which is why the team is moving forward. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=819.0s)]
*  So it's not that we're not chasing performance in these years, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=821.0s)]
*  but the large transformation is taking place in the future. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=824.0s)]
*  And if I step away from that, actually what we're trying to do is this. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=827.0s)]
*  We're investing in people, culture, innovation, technology, commercial, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=831.0s)]
*  as one of the avenues as well at the same time. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=835.0s)]
*  And fundamentally, all of that has a transformation being applied to it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=838.0s)]
*  And this year's car, and probably even more so next year's, will be a compromise. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=842.0s)]
*  But I'm really excited by what's happening in 26, 27, and 28. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=847.0s)]
*  And it's a hard thing to do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=851.0s)]
*  It's a hard thing for any business in the world to do to effectively give up almost on what you're doing. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=853.0s)]
*  But if we don't, we're not going to be winning championships. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=858.0s)]
*  And the reason why I joined here isn't to be sixth or fifth. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=861.0s)]
*  It's lovely. It makes me feel good inside. But I'm here to be winning. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=865.0s)]
*  But when you do that, you still have a lot of people to convince. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=869.0s)]
*  They're all in your shirt here, that it's going to be okay. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=872.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. So every partner that's here, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=875.0s)]
*  near enough actually, there was one there that was in place before I joined, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=881.0s)]
*  and pretty much all the other partners have been placed since I've joined. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=886.0s)]
*  We'll have this conversation where I'll go through, you've got two options. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=889.0s)]
*  I'll lay them out for you. Tell me which way you want to go. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=891.0s)]
*  We can be top six, and I can carry that on for five years. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=894.0s)]
*  Or you can be part of the biggest sports transformation that I think is going to exist in a long, long time. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=898.0s)]
*  Because we are not tickling it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=903.0s)]
*  We are down to foundations, properly destroying and starting again. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=905.0s)]
*  Do you want to be a part of that? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=909.0s)]
*  And every single one said, yes, that's what I prefer. Go that way. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=910.0s)]
*  So, go on board. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=914.0s)]
*  If we have any questions, happy to take a couple. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=916.0s)]
*  We have microphones. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=919.0s)]
*  So, when a winner comes out of racing, so either it is a car win or it's a driver winning. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=924.0s)]
*  I mean, it is because of the design and the kind of aerodynamics things we are using the car, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=931.0s)]
*  because of the win or because of the skill of the driver, or it's a combination of both. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=936.0s)]
*  It depends. If I had a driver up here right now, they would go, it's the skill of the driver. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=941.0s)]
*  But they are not here, so I can tell you what it really is. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=946.0s)]
*  The way I try and put it is probably the easiest way is I can put it into data. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=950.0s)]
*  Between the best driver on the grid and the worst driver on the grid is probably one second a lap. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=954.0s)]
*  Maybe a little bit less now, maybe eight tenths a lap. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=959.0s)]
*  Between the best car on the grid and the worst car on the grid is probably something akin to eight tenths. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=962.0s)]
*  So, in reality, the answer is both. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=967.0s)]
*  Max is not going to win a championship in a stake car, which is at the back of the grid, as simple as that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=970.0s)]
*  Norwood Lewis, for that matter. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=978.0s)]
*  It's a more complicated answer to that, because actually what happens is the best drivers in the world, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=980.0s)]
*  and I'm very privileged because next year I really do think I have the best line-up, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=984.0s)]
*  they push the team forward. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=988.0s)]
*  So, it's not just about the performance they have in the car, it's out of the car, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=990.0s)]
*  how do I get absolutely everything out of this team? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=993.0s)]
*  Every millisecond I need it to perform for you. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=996.0s)]
*  So, actually it drives the team performance forward as well. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=999.0s)]
*  But if you want a politically correct answer, 50-50 is the right way forward. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1002.0s)]
*  How do you think the idea of AI driver? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1009.0s)]
*  So, this is a very personal one for me. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1013.0s)]
*  I'll separate it into two things, AI and then AI driver, which is your question. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1015.0s)]
*  AI is a fundamental part of our sport and will become a fundamental part of every single business in this room over the next 10 years. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1020.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1028.0s)]
*  AI driver, I'm convinced we can make a driver that is faster than our Formula One drivers today. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1029.0s)]
*  I'm convinced of it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1035.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't watch it. It doesn't interest me at all. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1036.0s)]
*  What I'm excited by is I have two individuals who will put their life on the line. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1039.0s)]
*  They really do. They can injure themselves very significantly because they're gladiators, they're elite athletes, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1043.0s)]
*  they're pushing themselves harder than anyone else I know in this world. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1049.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm a part of the sport. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1052.0s)]
*  It's because I'm a part of their journey as well at the same time. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1054.0s)]
*  So, I think we can do something faster, but it doesn't excite me. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1056.0s)]
*  Everyone here? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1063.0s)]
*  What new city would you personally want to see the Grand Prix race in? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1065.0s)]
*  So, first and foremost, actually, you asked the question the right way, which is you used the word city rather than country. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1069.0s)]
*  Because when you come to Singapore, this really is on my top three of places to go. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1076.0s)]
*  The whole city transforms around you and you feel special, rewarded, a part of something that's unique and incredible. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1082.0s)]
*  Since it joined the calendar in 2008, there's nothing else like it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1089.0s)]
*  You can't stand around or even, if you wanted to, be in an infinity pool looking over it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1092.0s)]
*  Formula One cars going around a street circuit at 300 km an hour, that doesn't exist. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1097.0s)]
*  And it's here at night. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1102.0s)]
*  Answering your question though, I'm actually more one for world presence. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1104.0s)]
*  So, already, if you look at what Formula One was and what it is today, we're now at about 1.5 billion viewership around the world. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1109.0s)]
*  Growth is enormous, especially with women, really, under 35 women. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1115.0s)]
*  So, we've done the right thing there. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1119.0s)]
*  But where we don't have enough presence, in my opinion, is in Asia. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1121.0s)]
*  I'm absolutely convinced of that and other continents that we haven't even touched yet. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1124.0s)]
*  But focusing on Asia, first and foremost, we've been in quite large conversations with Thailand especially. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1128.0s)]
*  Obviously, Alex is the first and the only driver from Thailand on the grid. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1133.0s)]
*  He speaks under the British accent, ignore that bit. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1138.0s)]
*  But it is actually Asia is a huge part that I just don't think we're doing a good enough job to get our presence within. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1141.0s)]
*  I think it's actually lacking in some regards. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1149.0s)]
*  Yes, we have Japan and we have Singapore, great. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1151.0s)]
*  But I think there's a huge amount more room to have more dominance within this area, more presence within this area. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1153.0s)]
*  And it's ticking over in the background, there are meetings taking place. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1159.0s)]
*  But for me personally, I think this is the area I'd like to see more growth. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1163.0s)]
*  But I'm going to follow up on that question because we are currently at 24 Grand Prix on the calendar. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1167.0s)]
*  It's about 50% more than when you would have started. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1172.0s)]
*  How much further can this stretch? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1175.0s)]
*  I mean, there is a human toll, there is a logistical toll. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1177.0s)]
*  Where are we going? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1181.0s)]
*  So, I don't think we're going to go above 24. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1183.0s)]
*  But here's the interesting one, just as an anecdote, as teams. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1185.0s)]
*  We used to do 16 races and I thought, well, that's really tough. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1188.0s)]
*  Then we went to 18 races, 19 races, 20 races, 21. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1193.0s)]
*  It was like a frog in hot water when you boil it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1196.0s)]
*  It doesn't realize what's going on. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1199.0s)]
*  Now we're at 24 and you're like, this is pretty hard now. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1201.0s)]
*  I don't think we can go above 24. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1203.0s)]
*  I just don't think it's the right package either. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1205.0s)]
*  You're asking, forget about us for the time being. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1208.0s)]
*  Is it right that you're asking families at home to sit in front of a TV set for half the year, which is what it is now? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1211.0s)]
*  That's not correct. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1217.0s)]
*  I think that's probably the upper limit of where you want to be. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1218.0s)]
*  But we also have races that are part of our calendar that perhaps are not as spectacular as they once were, let's say. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1221.0s)]
*  And there are other literal countries that want to come in and make themselves successful in the sport. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1229.0s)]
*  And I think we should be open minded to that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1234.0s)]
*  And there's ways around it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1236.0s)]
*  Very simply, you can rotate some of the European races. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1237.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be a problem rotating them once every two years, creating room for other avenues to come in at the same time. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1239.0s)]
*  So, I don't think we can go above 24. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1245.0s)]
*  I don't think it's right to go above 24. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1247.0s)]
*  But also, I think it is right to be welcoming new countries, new cities into this. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1249.0s)]
*  Because there is a feeling right now that F1 is having a moment and you need to keep capitalizing on it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1254.0s)]
*  Is there a risk of dilating it a little bit? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1260.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1263.0s)]
*  I think everything's supply and demand, which is fundamentally if you provide too much of the product, people aren't going to be interested in it anymore. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1265.0s)]
*  And you will kill both your fan base and your monetary source behind it as well. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1272.0s)]
*  Just for pretty much where we are, we're not there at the moment. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1277.0s)]
*  I mean, the demand was with F1 just last week and there were six countries that want to be a part of our calendar. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1281.0s)]
*  And it's how you accommodate that at the moment. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1290.0s)]
*  So, I'm unsure how to accommodate it apart from the rotation of the European rounds and a few other little tricks that we can do. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1292.0s)]
*  But I would say the next five years are looking very, very good. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1299.0s)]
*  Did we have any more questions from the audience? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1303.0s)]
*  So, you signed Carlos Sainz for next year and Franco's come into the car, scored points, potentially have a great season. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1309.0s)]
*  Then he'll have to obviously step out for next year, Carlos comes in. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1318.0s)]
*  How do you continue to, I guess, nurture that talent and what sort of situations does that leave you in? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1321.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1328.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1329.0s)]
*  So, Franco will always be a part of the Academy and our program, irrespective anyway, because that's one of the strengths I have. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1330.0s)]
*  I invest in them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1339.0s)]
*  What he will be next year is if Audi don't take him and for transparency we are in conversations to see if that is a route for him where he could be on the grid with them for two years. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1340.0s)]
*  Then what we would do is we run a two-year-old car, which is actually the same specification pretty much as what we're running now. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1350.0s)]
*  He'd be running in that for thousands and thousands of kilometers to keep himself basically into a good shape. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1357.0s)]
*  He would work with us on developing the future cars by being in our simulator and doing that testing work for us at the same time. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1363.0s)]
*  There were a number of racing series we're looking at him with him for so that he can keep his hand really in racing at the same time. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1369.0s)]
*  He would be our reserve driver. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1377.0s)]
*  He'd be ready to stand by should anything happen. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1378.0s)]
*  And what I have learned in the last 12 months is that the F1 driver situation is not over. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1380.0s)]
*  It's good for us. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1388.0s)]
*  We're signed. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1389.0s)]
*  But watch next year. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1390.0s)]
*  I think you're going to see a little bit more movements. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1391.0s)]
*  There's more opportunity out there as well at the same time. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1393.0s)]
*  So having one of the best drivers on the grid available, I think will be a strength. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1395.0s)]
*  Any other questions from the audience? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1401.0s)]
*  This lady down here. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1405.0s)]
*  So I'd love to ask about your talent management skills because you've got two drivers on the team. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1410.0s)]
*  They're both gladiators, as you say. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1417.0s)]
*  How do you make them both better, which is what you have to do? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1419.0s)]
*  So we're a cover. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1424.0s)]
*  I cover a little background to that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1426.0s)]
*  We're a very unique sport where it's a team sport. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1428.0s)]
*  But I have two individuals who first try and beat the other person because if you beat them, you look stronger than anything else. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1433.0s)]
*  And there's not many other sports like that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1439.0s)]
*  How I deal with that bit of it is everything is about something much bigger than the two of them or me. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1441.0s)]
*  Everything is about Williams fundamentally. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1447.0s)]
*  It's about the legacy that you leave behind, the sportsmanship that you've behind. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1449.0s)]
*  The impact that they have on the sport will last for decades if you do it the right way. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1452.0s)]
*  If you do it the wrong way, it will last for minutes. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1456.0s)]
*  Simple as that. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1459.0s)]
*  So you elevate it far beyond myself or the two of them. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1460.0s)]
*  The next bit is like any other human being, any part of your senior management, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1465.0s)]
*  you just need to spend enough time with them to understand what is going on in their lives and what's important. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1470.0s)]
*  I truly care about Alex and about Franco. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1476.0s)]
*  I know what's going on in the family, what's going on in the history, what happened last week. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1478.0s)]
*  And by having that knowledge and that connection with them, it's not that I'm their friend. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1483.0s)]
*  I remain their boss. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1487.0s)]
*  But I have an awareness of where they need support and where they don't need support in the grand scheme of where we're moving forward to. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1488.0s)]
*  And I sort of apply the same rules to my senior management. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1494.0s)]
*  And it is about having a connection where I'm asking them to do far more than be in the office from 8 till 5 p.m. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1497.0s)]
*  They are giving their life as far as I go to me and every minute of it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1505.0s)]
*  And in return, the least I can do back to them is invest my time into them as best as possible [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1508.0s)]
*  and create a platform where I'm always there and available. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1512.0s)]
*  And if there's anything I can do, I will do as a result of it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1515.0s)]
*  So that's a little bit of it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1518.0s)]
*  And the second part of it is I have certain rules that I've always worked by as a sportsman. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1520.0s)]
*  And I ask them to abide by the same rules, which is no one wants to win because you've cheated your way there. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1525.0s)]
*  I want to do things because you are proud of what you've achieved and everyone else will be proud of what you've achieved. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1531.0s)]
*  And that for a sportsman is the highest accolade they can achieve. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1536.0s)]
*  So you create a construct where they will move towards it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1539.0s)]
*  So how often are you in one-on-one conversation with the drivers? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1542.0s)]
*  How often will you check in? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1544.0s)]
*  Every weekend fundamentally and outside of that, messaging pretty much every two days or so. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1546.0s)]
*  Something in that ballpark, enough that you're connected to them, enough that they get irritated by me. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1551.0s)]
*  We've talked about how the job of team principal has changed. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1558.0s)]
*  We've talked about how the technology has changed. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1561.0s)]
*  But what other ways have you seen the kind of profile of F1 change [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1564.0s)]
*  and how do you experience that sort of with the resurgence we've seen in the past few years? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1569.0s)]
*  It was your own question that you spoke about. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1574.0s)]
*  What's really changed is Netflix Drive to Survive. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1576.0s)]
*  I've been doing this for nearly 30 years and the viewership went up, as you would imagine, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1579.0s)]
*  and the interest went up, as you would imagine as well. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1586.0s)]
*  It's around COVID time, but around that 2018-19 region, it exploded. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1588.0s)]
*  It wasn't a sport anymore about two drivers. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1592.0s)]
*  It was a sport about us as a team and what we're doing and how we're doing it as a result of things. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1595.0s)]
*  And here was the interesting thing. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1600.0s)]
*  Netflix, when it was presented to us, wasn't number one of the things that would change the sport. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1602.0s)]
*  It was number 16. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1606.0s)]
*  We had no idea what it was going to do to the sport. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1608.0s)]
*  And what's changed now is my life is not just about building the fastest engineering car that we can. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1610.0s)]
*  It is to what you said. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1617.0s)]
*  We have to deal with the social aspects of things. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1619.0s)]
*  And more importantly, that is as important now a part as anything else. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1622.0s)]
*  So that's what's changed, really. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1627.0s)]
*  The second bit is when I started in the sport, it was a sport. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1628.0s)]
*  It really was a sport. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1631.0s)]
*  It was about go to the track, do the best you can. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1632.0s)]
*  The logos on the car, don't worry about those. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1635.0s)]
*  Just go do the best you can. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1637.0s)]
*  It's a business now. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1639.0s)]
*  We have to make sure that we have partners who want to be by our side, who believe in what we're doing. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1640.0s)]
*  And we are open and honest with them as well on that journey. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1644.0s)]
*  And that's a much better way of operating a business. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1647.0s)]
*  A little anecdote story, just because it's funny. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1650.0s)]
*  In my last place, we had the UK tax organization come and see us. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1653.0s)]
*  We'd been operating for 18 years. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1657.0s)]
*  And they came to see us because they said, you haven't made profit in 18 years. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1659.0s)]
*  We went, yep, welcome to Formula One. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1662.0s)]
*  And they couldn't believe it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1665.0s)]
*  Basically, that was Formula One businesses. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1667.0s)]
*  And if you think about it, you can't run an organization that way. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1669.0s)]
*  That's why at the end of 2008, so many teams pulled out. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1673.0s)]
*  That's why even when it got to COVID, we thought Formula One was over. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1676.0s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1679.0s)]
*  That was the resurgence. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1680.0s)]
*  We've made it into a business now. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1681.0s)]
*  And that's what's changed. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1683.0s)]
*  And it's good. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1684.0s)]
*  And does that shifting profile and kind of the greater attention on teams that don't win every week, does that help you too? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1685.0s)]
*  I think it's only a good thing. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1692.0s)]
*  Because as long as you're true to who you are and you're playing and act on things, no one can strip that away from me fundamentally. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1695.0s)]
*  Are you saying there are people in Formula One who are acting? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1701.0s)]
*  I may have intonated as such. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1703.0s)]
*  I mean, there is a lot of anger in the room when they film it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1706.0s)]
*  Genuinely, there is anger there. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1708.0s)]
*  But there are some that play up to it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1709.0s)]
*  For me, by all means, attack what we're doing. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1712.0s)]
*  But I'm confident in the pathway that we are taking, confident in the investment we're doing. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1715.0s)]
*  And I will be very open and clear on what our pathway was and where we're going towards. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1719.0s)]
*  And that has negatives and positives associated with it. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1724.0s)]
*  But what I've found so far is no one can take that apart from the media. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1727.0s)]
*  Whereas if you're caught in a lie, you can be stripped of everything. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1730.0s)]
*  That's the best way I can put it to you. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1734.0s)]
*  Any final questions? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1737.0s)]
*  Thank you. Very insightful. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1741.0s)]
*  Do you think as the world is normalizing EV, is Formula One going to move to electrification? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1743.0s)]
*  So this is a fascinating question. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1750.0s)]
*  Because EV is being normalized. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1753.0s)]
*  But if you follow EV car prices, just do it in residual prices, you will see that they are rock bottom. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1757.0s)]
*  Because there's no interest in it fundamentally. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1762.0s)]
*  The UK wasn't ready with the infrastructure. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1764.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure it's the overall solution for the fact that it's still going to have 1.4 billion cars on the road in a few years' time. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1766.0s)]
*  So answering the question, this is now very much my opinion. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1773.0s)]
*  I'm not attached to a manufacturer. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1775.0s)]
*  But what we're doing for 2026 in F1 is we're going to a fully synthetic fuel. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1777.0s)]
*  A fully synthetic fuel, which by the way has more power than the fuel we're running today. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1781.0s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1785.0s)]
*  It pulls carbon out of the air to create it. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1786.0s)]
*  It's made from effectively biomass. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1788.0s)]
*  And it's a clean burn as well. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1790.0s)]
*  So it's actually better than carbon neutral. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1792.0s)]
*  It costs a lot at the moment, but it won't in the future. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1794.0s)]
*  This is my opinion. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1797.0s)]
*  But if you want a way of surviving through not just EV, but a way of the world having cars on the road, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1798.0s)]
*  synthetic fuel will get you a long way there for many years until we figure out what the right technology is. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1803.0s)]
*  Irrespective of all that though, our cars are the most efficient engines that exist apart from gas tire binds. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1808.0s)]
*  I mean a fuel powered one. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1815.0s)]
*  There's nothing even close to it in terms of efficiency at the moment. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1817.0s)]
*  It's not because we use electrification in that purpose, but it's more as a hybrid route rather than pure EV. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1820.0s)]
*  And I believe again about just being optimized what you're doing. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1826.0s)]
*  Every gram of fuel that goes into the car, first of all, should be optimized to the nth degree, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1829.0s)]
*  which is what these Formula One engines do. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1833.0s)]
*  But beyond that, I think we should be finding solutions that help the entire world, not just a racing series. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1835.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why I joined our sport. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1840.0s)]
*  This is like engineering, but you're doing it 50 times faster than anyone else and you're proving it out [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1843.0s)]
*  in front of 50 to 70 million people. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1848.0s)]
*  So it's sort of answering your question. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1851.0s)]
*  I'm not sure EV is the right solution worldwide across every single continent for the next 10 years, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1853.0s)]
*  but I think synthetic fuel can fill a void. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1858.0s)]
*  And following on from that, the way it always was when the manufacturers were directly fielding teams [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1861.0s)]
*  was that F1 was the very high end R&D department. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1866.0s)]
*  Is that still the case or have F1 and sort of the road car business diverged? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1871.0s)]
*  No, it's still very much the R&D for it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1876.0s)]
*  I mean, all of the cars that you would have come here today would have had technology developed in Formula One. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1879.0s)]
*  That doesn't matter if it's traction control or ABS or some of the wide height controls you're doing, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1884.0s)]
*  active suspension, all of that developed. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1888.0s)]
*  Actually, a lot of that developed in Williams, for what it's worth. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1890.0s)]
*  Those are all products developed in it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1893.0s)]
*  In high end cars, carbon chassis, the carbon work that goes around things, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1896.0s)]
*  or even some of the different technologies and methods used in manufacturing, developed in Formula One. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1899.0s)]
*  What isn't is production methods because we produce three items. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1903.0s)]
*  We don't produce 10,000 of them, so production methods are developed outside of it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1906.0s)]
*  But as I said before, one of the reasons why I joined this sport is I wanted to make a real world difference with all I'm doing. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1911.0s)]
*  I love going around in circles very quickly, don't get me wrong, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1916.0s)]
*  but I also enjoy the fact that what I have done has made a real world difference. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1919.0s)]
*  And as I said, you'll see synthetic fuel is one of those, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1924.0s)]
*  and some of the other technologies we're coming up with are that as well. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1928.0s)]
*  But they haven't diverged as much as you may think at the moment. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1931.0s)]
*  Any more in the room? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1935.0s)]
*  I have more. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1937.0s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1939.0s)]
*  Sorry, I just looked up your profile and I see that you worked at Braun GP. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1943.0s)]
*  So maybe could you tell us a bit about your experience back there? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1947.0s)]
*  Because it was a team that wasn't supposed to exist, but ended up winning the World Championship. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1950.0s)]
*  So maybe share a bit about your experience there. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1955.0s)]
*  I mean, how long have you got? Because I can talk about this for days. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1958.0s)]
*  So for all of those who don't know, Braun GP was a fairy tale story. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1962.0s)]
*  I don't think it will ever exist again in our sport. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1966.0s)]
*  We were a team without a manufacturer behind us with no money, and I really do mean no money at all. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1968.0s)]
*  And we won the Formula One World Championship against the greats at the time. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1975.0s)]
*  And it really was what you read, it's what was happening. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1979.0s)]
*  So a little bit of background to it. We were Honda in 2008. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1982.0s)]
*  It came into the financial crisis and not just Honda, Honda Toyota, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1985.0s)]
*  a number of other manufacturers pulled all of their funding. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1990.0s)]
*  So overnight, about 910 people lost their job. I was one of those people. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1993.0s)]
*  The following day, 910 people were in the factory. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=1999.0s)]
*  The following week, 910 people were in the factory. We had no job. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2003.0s)]
*  We kept working on a car that we believed in so much that we wanted it to get going. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2006.0s)]
*  I was very fortunate to be part of a senior management team who were desperately trying to effectively find either a buyer or a way of us moving forward. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2012.0s)]
*  And several things happened. First and foremost, we got a little bit of funding from Honda. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2020.0s)]
*  Instead of closing the doors, effectively they gave us a pool of money and said, here you go, we have no responsibility anymore. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2025.0s)]
*  Mercedes, we managed to convince them to put an engine in the back of it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2031.0s)]
*  The chassis is a big carbon lump. It's basically a big hinge that connects the engine to the wheels. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2036.0s)]
*  We actually had to cut off the back 50 millimeters of it to fit the engine in. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2042.0s)]
*  We couldn't fit any of the hybrid unit in at all. All we could fit in was the engine that year. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2046.0s)]
*  But, and there was a but to it, why were we all doing this? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2051.0s)]
*  That car had been developed by all of us for 12 months in three different wind tunnels. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2055.0s)]
*  I could tell you hands down that was going to be the quickest car out there because that's what we invested in. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2060.0s)]
*  We put all of our effort in. You can sort of see why in Williams I'm doing something similar. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2065.0s)]
*  You just basically forward link to a future performance state. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2069.0s)]
*  Probably the saddest moment of that year was that as I got on an airplane to go to Melbourne, we made 450 people redundant. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2074.0s)]
*  So if you had an airplane ticket, you knew you were safe. That was pretty much how it worked at that point, which is sad. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2083.0s)]
*  But we couldn't survive with a large organization. We had to effectively shrink right down to what the bare bones were. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2089.0s)]
*  We didn't have enough money to go testing. So we actually went testing at Silverstone. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2095.0s)]
*  There's a tiny little track. It's not a big track. It's a tiny little track. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2100.0s)]
*  And we did 50 laps around it. The car seemed to work. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2103.0s)]
*  Put it inside a truck, transported it to Barcelona where everyone had been testing already for three weeks. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2107.0s)]
*  Took it out of the truck, same tires, rolled it out, went out and did basically just the six time that run. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2113.0s)]
*  So the Jensen button, who's part of Williams today as well, got used to it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2119.0s)]
*  He came back in and he said, I'm so sorry. The car is terrible. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2124.0s)]
*  Really, it's not handling very well at all. Okay, tell us what's wrong. We'll fix this. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2129.0s)]
*  Just too much understeer in the car. Fixed it. He went back out. Same tires we ran for Silverstone. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2134.0s)]
*  So they're now 60 laps old. Came back in and said, I'm so sorry. I thought this was our year. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2139.0s)]
*  But the car doesn't feel good. We walked into the timing page where we were three and a half seconds faster than anyone else. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2144.0s)]
*  And he went, well, actually the car's fine as it turns out. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2150.0s)]
*  So that day we loaded it with fuel and ballast and just made it as heavy as we possibly could. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2154.0s)]
*  They kept deleting our lap times because they thought we were cutting the chicane. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2159.0s)]
*  It was just the strangest thing. All the teams would come up to us and go, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2163.0s)]
*  I know you're having to run it illegal to get sponsors. Yeah, okay. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2166.0s)]
*  Anyway, turned up at the first race and we were missing so many people that even back then you had to do refueling. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2171.0s)]
*  The people that did the refueling, they actually wanted to leave. So we let them go. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2178.0s)]
*  So we had no team that had ever done a live refueling before. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2183.0s)]
*  And if you look back at Melbourne, you'll see each pit stop took about 20 seconds longer than it should have done. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2186.0s)]
*  And yet we finished one too. By the way, the refueler, he became an electrician. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2190.0s)]
*  We actually paid him just to fly out at weekends to do refueling. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2195.0s)]
*  And then we flew him back home and he did electrician back home. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2198.0s)]
*  But it was an incredible year where everything just went right. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2201.0s)]
*  We only had two chassis, two front wings, two rear wings, the first six races, which we won all of them. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2207.0s)]
*  If anyone had hit us once or we made a mistake, our championship would have been over. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2213.0s)]
*  It was a fascinating year and a lovely year. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2217.0s)]
*  We haven't got all night, but it's a good thing to know out of it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2221.0s)]
*  Well, we wish you much of the same at Williams. Thank you, James. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2225.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-fvFq62E-0&t=2229.0s)]
