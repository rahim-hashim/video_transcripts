# Former Trump Advisor on Why He Is Supporting Harris in 2024 Election | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo)
*  All right, we're having an election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me just stay for a... [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=2.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=6.0s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=8.0s)]
*  Well, I'll mention briefly, as many in this audience probably know, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=10.0s)]
*  you're an advisor to Trump, but you've switched over to the Harris side [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=17.0s)]
*  and you were present as a surrogate at the debate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=23.0s)]
*  This is going to be easier than the White House press corps, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=27.0s)]
*  Because you could have said I got fired by Trump after 11 days, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=30.0s)]
*  That would have been the truth, actually. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=34.0s)]
*  But, yeah, so, you know, I worked for the former president for about nine months. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=38.0s)]
*  He was on the campaign. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=44.0s)]
*  We did 71 campaign stops together, did the convention, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=46.0s)]
*  hundreds of hours of media advocacy on his behalf. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=50.0s)]
*  When he won, which none of us thought he was going to win, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=53.0s)]
*  I was on the executive transition team for the 12 weeks leading up to the inauguration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=56.0s)]
*  And then, in ill-fated mistake by me, I took a job with him in July of 2017 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=61.0s)]
*  and after 11 days got fired. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=69.0s)]
*  But I know the son of a bitch really well, so we can talk about that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=71.0s)]
*  I can tell you what he's going to do and how he thinks, but go ahead. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=75.0s)]
*  Well, as someone who advised Trump successfully, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=79.0s)]
*  maybe you were surprised that he won, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=82.0s)]
*  and I think you've said you back the winning candidate in each of the last two presidential elections. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=84.0s)]
*  This time you're backing Kamala Harris. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=89.0s)]
*  What does she need to do to win and not do? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=91.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to provide context. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=95.0s)]
*  So let's take it back to the 21st of July. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=99.0s)]
*  It's a Sunday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=102.0s)]
*  She's flipping pancakes in her kitchen, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=104.0s)]
*  and she gets a phone call from the president, President Biden, that he's stepping out, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=106.0s)]
*  and she's now going to be endorsed by him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=111.0s)]
*  And she is not yet the presumptive nominee, so she has to scramble. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=114.0s)]
*  She's doing three things simultaneously. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=119.0s)]
*  She's merging her staff with his reelection team. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=121.0s)]
*  She's got to go out and find the delegates that are the Biden-Harris delegates [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=126.0s)]
*  and get them to commit to her so that there's not this intranet warfare that takes place inside the party. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=131.0s)]
*  And then the third thing is she has to find a way to make sure that she's respectful to the president, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=138.0s)]
*  so as evidenced by the convention. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=145.0s)]
*  If you look at the platform, President Biden's name was left in the platform, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=148.0s)]
*  and literally everything that was in the platform was his, not hers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=153.0s)]
*  And so she had to get the nomination, knock out the other potential contenders. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=158.0s)]
*  She then had to prepare for the debate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=163.0s)]
*  And if you look at the timeline, I think she's done an incredible job in a very short period of time. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=165.0s)]
*  Now, are there critics? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=171.0s)]
*  Certainly, people would say, well, she needs to do more interviews, sit with more people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=173.0s)]
*  She needs to flesh out her economic agenda. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=178.0s)]
*  She needs to speak with greater clarity about what she wants to do, what her vision is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=180.0s)]
*  And I think all of that is coming, and she started that process. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=186.0s)]
*  But I think the first thing on her mind from a priority perspective was, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=189.0s)]
*  I've got to debate Donald Trump, and I have to compare and contrast myself, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=193.0s)]
*  my personality, and my vision for America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=198.0s)]
*  And I think she did a very good job of that, frankly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=202.0s)]
*  Do you think she should do more interviews, get out more like you do? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=205.0s)]
*  I do, and I think she is now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=211.0s)]
*  I don't think she's going to do as many interviews as the media would like, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=214.0s)]
*  because the media would like her to do six to eight interviews a day. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=221.0s)]
*  She's certainly not going to do that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=224.0s)]
*  Just one with the Wall Street Journal would be good. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=226.0s)]
*  I'll put your name in after this is over, depending on how the rest of this goes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=228.0s)]
*  Okay, well, I'll put your name in. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=233.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=235.0s)]
*  Listen, I'm impressed with her, and I will say something about her that is a very big difference [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=237.0s)]
*  with President Trump is that she is building a team, and she is building a coalition, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=243.0s)]
*  and so if you like President Trump in this room, you sort of know what you're getting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=249.0s)]
*  You're getting a team of one. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=254.0s)]
*  It's him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=256.0s)]
*  He's in the spotlight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=257.0s)]
*  He doesn't like other people speaking for him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=259.0s)]
*  He rebuked JD Vance during the debate for speaking for him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=261.0s)]
*  If cabinet members get out of line, he fires them immediately. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=265.0s)]
*  He did the same thing on The Apprentice. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=269.0s)]
*  If there were people starring on The Apprentice with him that were getting too much attention, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=272.0s)]
*  he fired them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=276.0s)]
*  And so what you get with him is a team of one. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=277.0s)]
*  What you get with her is a coalition. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=279.0s)]
*  You know, she's gone out to a very broad group of people, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=281.0s)]
*  and she's asked for help from Republicans and Democrats on debate prep. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=284.0s)]
*  She asked me to join her at the debate last Tuesday, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=289.0s)]
*  and she asked me to go into the spin room and advocate on her behalf. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=292.0s)]
*  I'm a lifelong Republican. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=296.0s)]
*  She's got the endorsement of Liz and Dick Cheney. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=298.0s)]
*  I mean, so just imagine this coalition. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=301.0s)]
*  It's like if Bernie Sanders, Anthony Scaramucci, and Dick Cheney walked into a bar, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=303.0s)]
*  okay, that's the... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=309.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't have the punchline for that, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=311.0s)]
*  but I'll come up with something hopefully before the election. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=312.0s)]
*  But the point I'm making is think of the coalition that she's building [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=315.0s)]
*  and think about her willingness to do that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=319.0s)]
*  In her debate, not her debate, but in her interview with CNN, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=322.0s)]
*  she said that she would consider putting Republicans in the cabinet, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=326.0s)]
*  and that's a big step, I think, in terms of where we are, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=331.0s)]
*  in terms of the tribalism inside the country, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=334.0s)]
*  in terms of the fight that we're having, the ideological fight that we're having. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=336.0s)]
*  There was a recent poll in Japan that found, speaking from an Asian perspective, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=342.0s)]
*  and I've been Tokyo bureau chief of the journal for the last 10 years, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=346.0s)]
*  and following Japanese attitudes towards Trump, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=350.0s)]
*  there was a recent poll that found if Japanese people were voting in the election, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=353.0s)]
*  70% would vote for Harris and 20% would vote for Trump, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=357.0s)]
*  and I think you might get reasonably similar results in other US allies around the world. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=362.0s)]
*  How do you explain Trump's staying power to an Asian audience? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=368.0s)]
*  Well, what I would say about Japan, and I would say this about Europe and parts of Asia, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=374.0s)]
*  is that these countries have hereditary memory from the specter and the rise of authoritarianism, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=380.0s)]
*  the specter and rise of fascism. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=388.0s)]
*  If you think about Japanese history, United Kingdom, Paris, France, et cetera, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=391.0s)]
*  if you're raised in France, you visit Normandy Beach. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=397.0s)]
*  That's one of your field trips. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=400.0s)]
*  If you're raised in London or in the United Kingdom, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=402.0s)]
*  you may visit the Churchill War cabinet, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=405.0s)]
*  or you may go to the Hiroshima Memorial in Japan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=408.0s)]
*  And so what I find about the United States is that in the 1930s, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=412.0s)]
*  when there was a rise of fascism and there was an American Nazi party [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=417.0s)]
*  and there were rallies, like a big rally, at Madison Square Garden, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=422.0s)]
*  and these rallies were led by people like Charles Lindbergh or Father Coughlin, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=426.0s)]
*  they were put down by Franklin Roosevelt. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=431.0s)]
*  And so we managed to keep our democracy, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=434.0s)]
*  and we managed to suppress the first America First movement. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=437.0s)]
*  And so in the United States, we don't have this memory. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=442.0s)]
*  We don't have this memory of the violence. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=445.0s)]
*  We don't have this memory of the terror, the lack of certainty, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=447.0s)]
*  unpredictability of laws, the legal system. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=451.0s)]
*  And so if you're in Japan and you see a leader like President Trump [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=454.0s)]
*  and you hear him talking the way he's talking, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=457.0s)]
*  you're like, okay, that's going to end badly [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=460.0s)]
*  because it ended badly here in my country or it ended badly in Europe. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=462.0s)]
*  But in the United States, we shielded the American public [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=466.0s)]
*  from this sort of hereditary memory. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=470.0s)]
*  And so that's one of the reasons, because people are looking for Patasias. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=472.0s)]
*  He talks like that sort of a populist leader, that only he can fix it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=478.0s)]
*  He'll balance the budget in four years. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=483.0s)]
*  Of course, he ran up the budget, $7.8 trillion. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=486.0s)]
*  He says he'll stop the Ukrainian war after 24 hours, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=489.0s)]
*  but we know that means that he's going to cede ground [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=493.0s)]
*  and he's going to cede freedoms to Vladimir Putin, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=496.0s)]
*  which I don't think that's something that we in the West want to do [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=500.0s)]
*  at this perilous time in the world. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=504.0s)]
*  We have 5.7 billion people in the world [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=507.0s)]
*  living under some form of authoritarianism right now, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=511.0s)]
*  some sort of dictatorship. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=514.0s)]
*  And I think it's very important for the United States [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=516.0s)]
*  to be part of the alliance that protects people [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=519.0s)]
*  from the yoke of that type of living. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=523.0s)]
*  But listen, I was with him. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=526.0s)]
*  I'll tell a quick story if you don't mind. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=529.0s)]
*  I was with Jeb Bush, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=531.0s)]
*  and I joined the Trump campaign after Jeb dropped out of the race. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=534.0s)]
*  2016. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=538.0s)]
*  2016. It was May. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=540.0s)]
*  We were traveling to Albuquerque, New Mexico together [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=542.0s)]
*  as the first campaign stop I did with then-candidate Trump. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=545.0s)]
*  And when we got to Albuquerque, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=549.0s)]
*  there were 9,000 people waiting in the Civic Center. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=552.0s)]
*  There were 6,000 people outside the Civic Center. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=555.0s)]
*  I mean, if we had five people at a Bush rally [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=558.0s)]
*  and three of them were staffers, it was like a miracle. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=561.0s)]
*  And here was Trump, 15,000, 16,000 people, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=564.0s)]
*  flat screens outside the event. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=568.0s)]
*  And I went into the event, the Secret Service was handing out [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=571.0s)]
*  these daypins. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=574.0s)]
*  I don't know if you ever travel with a presidential candidate [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=576.0s)]
*  or somebody who has Secret Service protection. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=579.0s)]
*  They give you a pin for your lapel. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=581.0s)]
*  I said to the Secret Service, I said, what is this for? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=583.0s)]
*  He said, well, if the shooting starts, we know you're with us. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=586.0s)]
*  We won't shoot at you. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=589.0s)]
*  I was like going like this with the pin, you know? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=591.0s)]
*  And you get very nervous. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=593.0s)]
*  But I took the pin off. I put it in my pocket. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=595.0s)]
*  I crossed the security perimeter, and I went into the crowd. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=597.0s)]
*  And I started to ask people why they were there, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=600.0s)]
*  what was the reason for them being there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=603.0s)]
*  And I'll give you the composite, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=605.0s)]
*  because it's very telling about where America is right now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=607.0s)]
*  There were people there. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=609.0s)]
*  And I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=611.0s)]
*  My dad was a crane operator, but I always tell people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=613.0s)]
*  that we had a great living standard. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=615.0s)]
*  I would never tell anybody I grew up poor. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=617.0s)]
*  I would never dishonor my dad's work ethic [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=619.0s)]
*  by telling you I grew up poor. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=621.0s)]
*  We had a nice house. We had a good public school system. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=623.0s)]
*  Life was very good in that period, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=626.0s)]
*  60s, 70s, and 80s in America. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=629.0s)]
*  But the aspirational working class families [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=632.0s)]
*  that I was a part of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=635.0s)]
*  had become economically desperational [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=637.0s)]
*  over a 35-year period of time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=640.0s)]
*  And so the families I was meeting in New Mexico [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=642.0s)]
*  were explaining that desperation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=645.0s)]
*  You know, one gentleman said to me, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=647.0s)]
*  hey, my dad was in the factory for 30 years. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=649.0s)]
*  He had a great job, and now he has a pension. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=652.0s)]
*  I was there for 12 years. I just got laid off. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=655.0s)]
*  I'm delivering pizza for Domino's, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=658.0s)]
*  and I'm working at Lowe's, the Home Improvement Center. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=660.0s)]
*  And, Anthony, you think you're in New Mexico, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=663.0s)]
*  but you know where New Mexico would be? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=665.0s)]
*  Okay, that would be Mexico, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=668.0s)]
*  because that's where the factory moved. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=669.0s)]
*  And I think you know this, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=671.0s)]
*  and the Journal always reports about this. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=672.0s)]
*  We lost 65,000 factories in the United States [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=674.0s)]
*  since the signing and the ratification of NAFTA in 1993. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=679.0s)]
*  So 30, 31 years, 65,000 factories, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=683.0s)]
*  a hollowing out of these towns [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=687.0s)]
*  that Mr. Trump was descending into in 2016, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=689.0s)]
*  and he was providing advocacy. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=692.0s)]
*  He was providing a voice. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=695.0s)]
*  Again, if you like him or dislike him, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=696.0s)]
*  that's why people are clinging to him. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=698.0s)]
*  They see him as a wrecking ball. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=701.0s)]
*  He's sort of an orange wrecking ball [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=704.0s)]
*  that will smash into the system, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=706.0s)]
*  and he'll bring down the system that's not working for them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=708.0s)]
*  And so the great irony of this, of course, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=711.0s)]
*  is that Biden wins. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=714.0s)]
*  Biden is from these people as well. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=716.0s)]
*  He grew up in Wilkes-Barre in Scranton, Pennsylvania, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=718.0s)]
*  in northeastern Pennsylvania, which is a coal mining town, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=720.0s)]
*  and he starts a legislative agenda [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=723.0s)]
*  that's actually quite effective. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=725.0s)]
*  He's reshoring manufacturing. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=727.0s)]
*  He passes the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=729.0s)]
*  which is effectively an infrastructure bill, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=732.0s)]
*  which is rebuilding bridges, roads, and tunnels [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=734.0s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=737.0s)]
*  lowering the cost of transit of goods. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=738.0s)]
*  He's providing, through the CHIPS Act, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=741.0s)]
*  the rebuild of microprocessor boundaries [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=744.0s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=747.0s)]
*  and there are many different things that he's doing, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=748.0s)]
*  and lo and behold, wages are up [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=751.0s)]
*  for middle and lower-middle-income people. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=753.0s)]
*  But the president's quite old, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=756.0s)]
*  to be very honest about this, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=758.0s)]
*  and he's not great at articulating [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=759.0s)]
*  the success of his legislative agenda. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=762.0s)]
*  And of course, we've got inflation looming over [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=765.0s)]
*  not just the United States, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=768.0s)]
*  but most of the industrialized world, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=769.0s)]
*  and they haven't really done a good job of explaining that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=771.0s)]
*  Of course, you work for the Journal, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=774.0s)]
*  so you know that that inflation is situational, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=776.0s)]
*  and you know that inflation was inducted [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=779.0s)]
*  from a combination of monetary policy [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=781.0s)]
*  and fiscal policy during COVID [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=784.0s)]
*  at a time where the supply chain broke. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=786.0s)]
*  Lots of money goes into the system to protect people. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=789.0s)]
*  Less goods are in the system [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=792.0s)]
*  because of the break in the supply chain, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=794.0s)]
*  and you get the inflation, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=796.0s)]
*  and of course, that's situational, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=797.0s)]
*  but we have a way of personalizing these things [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=799.0s)]
*  on our politicians, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=802.0s)]
*  and the Biden administration hasn't done a great job [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=804.0s)]
*  of explaining that that inflation actually started [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=807.0s)]
*  during the Trump administration. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=811.0s)]
*  Again, not Donald Trump's fault, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=813.0s)]
*  not anybody's fault, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=815.0s)]
*  but just a byproduct of all of us living in COVID [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=817.0s)]
*  and decisions that were made to protect [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=820.0s)]
*  and help people during COVID. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=822.0s)]
*  And so she has to get out there. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=824.0s)]
*  She has to explain that, and I think she will. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=826.0s)]
*  And you guys are probably looking at the polls. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=829.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, you probably look at them too much, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=832.0s)]
*  but she is tracking nicely in the polls right now, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=834.0s)]
*  and I would also tell you that the polls, in my opinion, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=837.0s)]
*  are factoring in the underpolling for Donald Trump, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=841.0s)]
*  whether it's the CNN poll, the Marist poll, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=845.0s)]
*  the New York Times poll. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=848.0s)]
*  They're building in the underpolling [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=850.0s)]
*  that they experienced in 16 and 20, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=852.0s)]
*  and if you look at those poll numbers, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=854.0s)]
*  she's doing quite well. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=857.0s)]
*  Plus six with likely voters. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=859.0s)]
*  She's anywhere to plus three plus four in Pennsylvania. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=862.0s)]
*  She needs to win Pennsylvania. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=866.0s)]
*  And so one would argue, yes, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=868.0s)]
*  she's got to get out to see the media more, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=870.0s)]
*  but if you think about where she was on July 21 [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=872.0s)]
*  and where she is here in the middle of September, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=875.0s)]
*  I think I would give her an A-plus in terms of her execution. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=878.0s)]
*  What about, you talked about factories moving to Mexico. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=882.0s)]
*  Many of them move to this part of the world as well, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=885.0s)]
*  whether it be China or Southeast Asia. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=887.0s)]
*  What should the next, in your opinion, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=892.0s)]
*  if you're an economic adviser to the next president, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=894.0s)]
*  maybe Donald Trump asks you to come back, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=898.0s)]
*  or perhaps Kamala Harris asks you for your advice about... [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=900.0s)]
*  I mean, I just want to say that my wife hates Donald Trump [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=903.0s)]
*  almost as much as Melania hates him, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=907.0s)]
*  and that's way up here. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=909.0s)]
*  So there'd be no chance of me going back. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=911.0s)]
*  I'm running for reelection in my marriage, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=914.0s)]
*  and so it could be on like a one-day term, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=917.0s)]
*  is for all I know. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=920.0s)]
*  So that'll never happen. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=922.0s)]
*  But let's say, whoever wins, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=924.0s)]
*  to me, I think there are three things that we need to do, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=928.0s)]
*  and I'm not saying either of these political leaders [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=931.0s)]
*  will be willing to do these things, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=934.0s)]
*  but I think there are three things. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=936.0s)]
*  I think, number one, we have to strengthen our alliances [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=938.0s)]
*  and move towards our alliances, not away from them. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=941.0s)]
*  That would include our alliances here in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=944.0s)]
*  It would include what we're doing with NATO. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=947.0s)]
*  We need to strengthen them. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=949.0s)]
*  And I think that that would send a very big message to the world [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=951.0s)]
*  that America is committed to peace and long-term prosperity [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=956.0s)]
*  for our trading partners [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=961.0s)]
*  and for the cause of freedom around the world. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=963.0s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=965.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump wants to go towards isolationism. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=967.0s)]
*  Don't go by me. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=969.0s)]
*  Just read the Condoleezza Rice piece in Foreign Affairs magazine, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=971.0s)]
*  which was published last week, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=974.0s)]
*  about the perils of isolationism. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=976.0s)]
*  So number one, we have to send a very resonating message to people [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=978.0s)]
*  that America is here to be part of that process [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=982.0s)]
*  of keeping people free and prosperous. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=986.0s)]
*  The second thing is we have to address [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=989.0s)]
*  the looming debt crisis in the United States. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=991.0s)]
*  It's not upon us today. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=994.0s)]
*  It may not be upon us tomorrow. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=996.0s)]
*  Certainly if Jeremy gets his stablecoin legislation passed, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=998.0s)]
*  that will strengthen the U.S. dollar [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1002.0s)]
*  and it will fortify dollar supremacy around the world. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1004.0s)]
*  But when you are spending over a trillion dollars [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1007.0s)]
*  of tax receipts on interest payments [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1012.0s)]
*  and you're looking at one to two trillion dollar deficits a year, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1015.0s)]
*  we have to do something about that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1020.0s)]
*  And we can fix that, by the way, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1022.0s)]
*  but it would take 15 or 20 years. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1024.0s)]
*  And so I submit to everybody rhetorically, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1026.0s)]
*  what political leader do you know in the United States [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1028.0s)]
*  that's offering a 10 or 20-year plan to right-size the deficit, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1031.0s)]
*  get the entitlements under control, et cetera, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1036.0s)]
*  and somebody needs to do that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1039.0s)]
*  Somebody needs to explain to the American people [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1041.0s)]
*  how this could be fixed. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1043.0s)]
*  It's not going to happen in two years, not four years, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1045.0s)]
*  but we can fix it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1047.0s)]
*  And since this is a short conversation, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1049.0s)]
*  I won't go into detail how we can do it, but we can do it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1051.0s)]
*  And then the third thing, which I think is very, very important, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1054.0s)]
*  is we have to figure out how to redo the tax code [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1057.0s)]
*  to create more economic incentives for growth in the blue states. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1062.0s)]
*  I think the state and local income tax deduction limitation [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1067.0s)]
*  that the Trump administration put in in December of 2017 [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1072.0s)]
*  has actually hurt the overall economy. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1075.0s)]
*  And I'll explain this briefly. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1078.0s)]
*  If you really study the United States, it's an immigration story. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1082.0s)]
*  The immigrants come into the port cities. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1086.0s)]
*  They typically come in quite poor. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1089.0s)]
*  You need safety nets in the port cities. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1091.0s)]
*  That would include the northeast and the west coast of the United States. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1094.0s)]
*  And the results of which, it was very wise to allow [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1097.0s)]
*  for the state income taxes to be deducted from the federal income taxes. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1101.0s)]
*  And so you can get people like Sergey Brin into the country. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1105.0s)]
*  He comes in penniless, goes on to make $100 billion, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1110.0s)]
*  and helps create a company like Google. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1113.0s)]
*  And so the country needs to restate its love affair with immigration. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1115.0s)]
*  It's got to fix the immigration problem. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1121.0s)]
*  I don't like the demonization of the immigrants. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1124.0s)]
*  I think the fight really started with me and Trump [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1126.0s)]
*  when he was telling Congresswomen to go back to the countries [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1128.0s)]
*  they originally came from. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1132.0s)]
*  I mean, that's American nativism. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1133.0s)]
*  They said that to my Italian-American grandmother 100 years ago. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1135.0s)]
*  It broke her heart when they said that to her. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1139.0s)]
*  That's not what we stand for. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1141.0s)]
*  That's a very un-American thing to say to people, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1143.0s)]
*  particularly when Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1146.0s)]
*  said that this was, the United States was the last best hope for mankind, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1150.0s)]
*  and it was a beacon of freedom. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1155.0s)]
*  So we have to restate the immigration love affair, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1157.0s)]
*  and we have to fix the tax code to support that demographic growth. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1161.0s)]
*  Because remember, in the West, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1167.0s)]
*  and this is one thing I agree with Elon Musk about, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1168.0s)]
*  is that we need population growth, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1170.0s)]
*  and in a place like the United States, you get it through immigration. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1172.0s)]
*  So those are the three things. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1175.0s)]
*  It sounds like you might be interested in running for, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1177.0s)]
*  just the way you're talking, it sounds like you also have the home vote. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1179.0s)]
*  There is no f***ing way that I'm running for all of them. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1184.0s)]
*  It's not even, you know, it's not even in the, it's no way. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1186.0s)]
*  I mean, in addition to other things, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1190.0s)]
*  my wife probably believes in castration on top of everything else. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1192.0s)]
*  You know, that was, let me say this to you, and I'll say this, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1195.0s)]
*  I'll say this in a very heartfelt way. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1199.0s)]
*  You know, I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1203.0s)]
*  I went to a couple of great schools. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1207.0s)]
*  I built a couple of successful businesses. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1209.0s)]
*  When I got asked to work for the American president, I wanted to do that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1211.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1216.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1217.0s)]
*  In the idealistic sense, I wanted to serve the country. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1218.0s)]
*  But in the real, puerile sense, in the ego-based, pride-based sense, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1222.0s)]
*  I wanted to do that because it was fitting my personal narrative. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1227.0s)]
*  And I did something that's very, very dangerous to do, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1231.0s)]
*  whether it's in your personal relationships, your career, or as an investor. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1234.0s)]
*  I know there's a lot of investors in the room. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1239.0s)]
*  When you put your pride and ego into your decision-making, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1242.0s)]
*  you make colossally disastrous decisions. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1247.0s)]
*  And so I won't name this person, but a mentor of mine, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1251.0s)]
*  he's about 10 or 12 years older than me, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1256.0s)]
*  he was offered a very big job in that administration. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1258.0s)]
*  He spent some time thinking about it, and he withdrew his name. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1261.0s)]
*  And I said, why did you withdraw your name? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1266.0s)]
*  He said, well, I spent enough time with Mr. Trump to know [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1269.0s)]
*  that our personalities were not going to mesh in that environment, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1271.0s)]
*  and therefore I dropped my pride, and I dropped my ego, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1276.0s)]
*  and I withdrew myself. I didn't do that. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1280.0s)]
*  I went towards the situation and not away from the situation. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1283.0s)]
*  And I share that with you today as a cautionary tale for yourselves, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1287.0s)]
*  because it was a very painful period of time in my career. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1291.0s)]
*  It's something that I'm glad I did with hindsight, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1296.0s)]
*  because perhaps I wouldn't be here speaking to you guys if I didn't do it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1299.0s)]
*  But the flip side of it was it was a pride-based and an ego-based decision, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1303.0s)]
*  and it wasn't grounded in what it needed to be to make a decision like that. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1308.0s)]
*  So just remember that when you're making decisions. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1312.0s)]
*  Take your pride and your ego out of the decision-making. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1315.0s)]
*  But no, I don't want to be anywhere near the politics, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1317.0s)]
*  but I love talking about it, of course. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1321.0s)]
*  And I have a fun podcast that I do with a woman named Cady Kay, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1323.0s)]
*  which we talk about this stuff. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1327.0s)]
*  And if the vice president asked me for help, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1330.0s)]
*  I would be there for her and help her in an advisory way. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1334.0s)]
*  We'll come to questions in just a moment. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1338.0s)]
*  You mentioned your high school and the great schools you went to. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1341.0s)]
*  It turns out we have someone, one of my close colleagues, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1346.0s)]
*  Hugh McOwen, one of our editors, was a couple years behind you at Schreiber High School. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1350.0s)]
*  Oh, is that right? Yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1355.0s)]
*  And you were elected to student council president as she remembers it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1357.0s)]
*  That was my last elective office, actually. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1361.0s)]
*  As she remembers it, it may have been a different... [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1364.0s)]
*  I was trying to get into college. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1366.0s)]
*  It wasn't really a politically motivated thing. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1367.0s)]
*  Well, she says that maybe you or another student body council president [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1370.0s)]
*  promised to fix the door knob, the broken door knob in the cafeteria. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1375.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was me. That was you. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1380.0s)]
*  Yeah, I fixed it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1381.0s)]
*  And you fixed it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1382.0s)]
*  I did. I fixed it. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1383.0s)]
*  She's very thankful to you for that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1384.0s)]
*  I fixed it. I planted 40 trees on that campus, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1385.0s)]
*  and the sign was actually falling down. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1388.0s)]
*  I was a little bit like... [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1391.0s)]
*  And I loved him, by the way. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1393.0s)]
*  I mean, he's totally nuts now, but I work for Mayor Giuliani. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1394.0s)]
*  And one of the things you have to do when you're in a job like that [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1398.0s)]
*  is you have to fix things. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1401.0s)]
*  You fix potholes. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1403.0s)]
*  You make sure that the mayor was great at what we used to call the broken windows. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1405.0s)]
*  We would go into the neighborhoods and make sure that everything was fixed, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1411.0s)]
*  which would send a message to people that we weren't going to accept lawlessness in the area. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1415.0s)]
*  But yeah, I fixed the Shriver High School sign, actually. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1419.0s)]
*  I don't know if she would remember that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1422.0s)]
*  So the sign itself was broken or the words on the sign? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1424.0s)]
*  Yeah, there were like three or four letters that had fallen off the sign [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1427.0s)]
*  and was driving me crazy, so I went out and bought the... [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1430.0s)]
*  I got guys up there to fix it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1432.0s)]
*  That's 40 years ago, but anyway. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1434.0s)]
*  Who's counting? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1436.0s)]
*  I do live in the neighborhood, though. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1437.0s)]
*  I do drive up there to make sure the sign is still okay, by the way. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1438.0s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1441.0s)]
*  Let me open it up for questions. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1443.0s)]
*  Anyone in the audience? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1446.0s)]
*  We're in the first... [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1448.0s)]
*  Thanks so much, and love your podcast. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1450.0s)]
*  A lot of our international... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1452.0s)]
*  I'm American. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1453.0s)]
*  You can tell a lot of my international friends love it. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1454.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1456.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you this. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1457.0s)]
*  So you articulate very well the message that Kamala Harris would have to say in terms of economics. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1458.0s)]
*  But how do you actually get that to resonate? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1464.0s)]
*  Do we need a charismatic personality akin to Trump? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1466.0s)]
*  Not that I'm a Trump fan, but do you need that on the other side to get that message out? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1470.0s)]
*  Because I worry that even with the most articulate and well-honed message on economics, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1476.0s)]
*  what does it take to actually reach some of those families that you talked about? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1482.0s)]
*  Okay, so I'm pretty sure everybody heard the question because it was on the mic, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1486.0s)]
*  so I won't repeat the question. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1489.0s)]
*  But I think it's an excellent question, and I'm going to answer it the way the campaign would answer it. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1491.0s)]
*  And so the first thing I would say to you is that Joe Biden, not a lot of charisma. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1497.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has a variant of charisma. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1502.0s)]
*  Some could call it malignant charisma in some ways because it's a tension getting more than it is something that you embrace. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1506.0s)]
*  So people that are voting for him, if you exit poll them or you ask them, is he a good guy, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1515.0s)]
*  80% of the people say, no, he's not a good guy, but he's my bad guy. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1520.0s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1525.0s)]
*  So there's a malignant charisma to Trump's personality. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1526.0s)]
*  Joe Biden, let's say, let's stipulate he doesn't have a lot of charisma, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1529.0s)]
*  but there was a comparison and contrast where he provided something that was more stable and more predictable. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1534.0s)]
*  And so the American people went in that direction. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1540.0s)]
*  Again, the popular vote was eight and a half million, but the swing state vote was only 40 or 50,000. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1543.0s)]
*  So it was a very close election. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1548.0s)]
*  But what the Harris team would say to you is that she doesn't need the charisma as much as she needs the turnout, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1550.0s)]
*  because this is a turnout election. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1557.0s)]
*  If you look at the polling data, there's very few people that are undecided. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1559.0s)]
*  Yes, there are some, but it's very, very few. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1564.0s)]
*  And this is a base turnout election. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1567.0s)]
*  And Trump knows this as well, which is why he picked J.D. Vance. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1570.0s)]
*  He didn't go with a Nikki Ailey or somebody else because he's really trying to turn out the core of his base. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1573.0s)]
*  In size. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1579.0s)]
*  And that's why he's he's blowing on various whistles, racial, anti immigration, misogyny, et cetera. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1580.0s)]
*  Those are whistles that he thinks are effective for his base. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1587.0s)]
*  She's looking at it from a different perspective. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1591.0s)]
*  She's got more registrants on the Democratic side, and she thinks she can make a broad appeal to those independent. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1594.0s)]
*  She's got more money than him, and she's got more field offices. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1600.0s)]
*  As an example, she's got 24 field offices in Pennsylvania. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1604.0s)]
*  He only has 12. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1609.0s)]
*  And so she's looking at it as this is a ground game grinded out to get the results in the swing states and beat him. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1611.0s)]
*  She doesn't have the quote unquote charisma that you're asking about, but they think that they can beat him anyway, despite that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1619.0s)]
*  And so we'll have to see if that happens. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1628.0s)]
*  But there's an expression that my grandmother used to say, which I'll share with you. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1630.0s)]
*  You can't put into somebody what God left out. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1635.0s)]
*  I mean, I would love to be six foot three, but it's only in my dreams. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1638.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1641.0s)]
*  Just not happening. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1642.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1643.0s)]
*  And so and so she has to take what she's good at. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1644.0s)]
*  She's got to take who she is, and she's got to make that work for her. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1647.0s)]
*  And one thing that she's doing, which I give her a lot of credit for, is she is expanding that tent. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1652.0s)]
*  You would be so impressed with the number of people that she has called that would be outside her core base that she's looking to. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1657.0s)]
*  Like when she when I was called to go down to Philadelphia on Sunday night, I got a phone call. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1664.0s)]
*  Could you please come down to Philadelphia and go to the spin room on behalf of the campaign? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1672.0s)]
*  And I was saying to myself, OK, that's a unnatural call. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1678.0s)]
*  Trump is not making that call to a liberal Democrat. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1682.0s)]
*  I'm a lifelong Republican. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1685.0s)]
*  And so I admire her for that. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1687.0s)]
*  And that may be enough to win the election, but you're not going to see somebody that's. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1689.0s)]
*  Charismatic, I think, in the way that you're describing it. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1695.0s)]
*  I'm afraid we'll have to leave it there. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1699.0s)]
*  I'm sure there are many other questions in the audience, but thank you so much. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1701.0s)]
*  I appreciate being here. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1704.0s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEp06Ngulbo&t=1705.0s)]
