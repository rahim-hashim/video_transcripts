**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE)
*  I want to start with something that I think people don't know about you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=3.0s)]
*  Which is that, not that many people know about you, which is that you've actually been at [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=4.0s)]
*  OpenAI longer than Sam Altman, the CEO and co-founder of OpenAI. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  And you both came from Y Combinator, this famous startup accelerator. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=11.96s)]
*  So I was just curious, after 10 years, what of Y Combinator is in the DNA of OpenAI? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=15.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=22.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, not many people know this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=23.44s)]
*  I hired Sam, actually. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=25.8s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=27.8s)]
*  But it's interesting, actually, to see kind of the YC DNA that is infused in OpenAI. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=29.96s)]
*  Our chief strategy officer, also Jason Kwan, came from Y Combinator. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=37.24s)]
*  And if you really think about what AI is at its core, right, it really is this entirely [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=41.56s)]
*  new foundation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=45.84s)]
*  It's this new kind of platform of technology. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=46.84s)]
*  And that means that there's a lot of things that are going to get built. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=49.72s)]
*  And so if YC was kind of the expression of all the things that kind of could have gotten [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=52.22s)]
*  built in the kind of software 2.0 era of technology, OpenAI, I think, is kind of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=56.96s)]
*  platform in which a lot of new things will get built in the AI era. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=63.32s)]
*  And we take a venture mindset as much as we can to how we think about what it is that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=68.0s)]
*  we do. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=72.08s)]
*  We try and let a lot of things, a lot of flowers bloom. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  We try and run a lot of experiments. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=77.4s)]
*  We have kind of a research mindset in that sense. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=79.1s)]
*  OpenAI started as a YC research project way back when. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=83.44s)]
*  And I think we're trying to be unconstrained kind of in our thinking and really focus on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=87.92s)]
*  like if this really works, right, if it goes well, what kind of upside is there for us? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=92.84s)]
*  And so you have to have, I think, a venture mindset almost in how you think about technology [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  when you're in a new phase. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=104.44s)]
*  So OpenAI was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal today because of this great [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=107.32s)]
*  scoop my colleagues had about how Elon Musk was upset that there's this big data center [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=111.76s)]
*  in Abu Dhabi that OpenAI isn't involved in and he was left out of. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=116.36s)]
*  And I think this project is really fascinating. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  It's part of this big Stargate AI infrastructure project that has made a lot of headlines. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  But in the announcement, it says that this is about building democratic AI. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=129.24s)]
*  And so, you know, I used to live in Abu Dhabi, wonderful place, wonderful people, not a democracy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=134.76s)]
*  So I'm curious, why would that be the first place you would build it? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=141.44s)]
*  And what about this tension between your goals of democratic AI and working with countries [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=145.56s)]
*  that are not democracies? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=150.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=152.32s)]
*  So the launch in the UAE is part of an initiative actually that we launched called OpenAI for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=153.32s)]
*  Countries. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=159.12s)]
*  And I think it's worth zooming out a little bit actually and talking about what is OpenAI [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=160.44s)]
*  for countries. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=163.44s)]
*  So one of the challenges that we have at OpenAI and one of the interesting things we've seen [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=165.2s)]
*  in deploying AI is the demand we see for the technology transcends kind of individual level [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  demand or company level demand. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=175.04s)]
*  It's actually in a lot of cases kind of national level demand. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's because countries realize that AI is going to be a critical component [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  of their future, of their competitiveness, of economic growth, of their ability to offer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=184.44s)]
*  services to citizens, of the way people engage with computers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=189.38s)]
*  And there's a real fear that countries have of not wanting to be left behind. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=194.46s)]
*  And so I think when we've kind of done these world tours, we do these kind of multi-week [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  world tours, and one of the things that we kept hearing consistently was everyone kind [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=203.58s)]
*  of wants their own version of a Stargate, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  They want to make infrastructure investments in their country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=210.52s)]
*  They want to figure out what the jobs of the future are. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  They want to be able to offer AI to citizens in an unrestricted way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  And so we at OpenAI now have the challenge of what does it mean to build that program [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=220.86s)]
*  and serve that level of use? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  So it's still pretty experimental. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=226.94000000000003s)]
*  The UAE will be kind of the first experiment somewhat. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  They're a very technology forward and technology led country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  Obviously have a lot of awareness of how to build infrastructure. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=235.96s)]
*  They've done an amazing job building infrastructure in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=238.5s)]
*  And so it will be the first version of it, hopefully not the last. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  But it's going to be a learning process for us, which includes, by the way, how we administer [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=247.44000000000003s)]
*  AI and how we serve the models that we serve in ways that are consistent with OpenAI's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=250.84s)]
*  principles and values. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=256.4s)]
*  And we do believe that the core of it has to be about democratic AI. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  It has to be about making sure that the rails that AI and all the kind of surrounding technologies [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  get built on is fundamentally AI that upholds a set of democratic values. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=266.48s)]
*  So I used to work at a newspaper in Abu Dhabi, and they have these red lines where you can't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  say certain things, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=280.12s)]
*  Like you can't criticize the royal family, for example. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=281.12s)]
*  I assume when CHAT GPT is rolled out to all the citizens of the UAE as part of that deal, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=284.48s)]
*  which is kind of an amazing part of the deal, that those red lines will be part of CHAT [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  GPT in the UAE. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=292.16s)]
*  Is that a safe assumption? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=293.16s)]
*  Well, we don't know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=294.16s)]
*  We've got to work on this together in partnership with the country and somewhat in partnership [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=295.56s)]
*  with the U.S. government as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=299.48s)]
*  I think what I can tell you is the things that really are important to us are, one is, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=301.12s)]
*  we've got to be able to enable access to people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=305.32s)]
*  Two is we really take security very seriously. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=307.6s)]
*  Three is we do take the model performance and behavior very seriously, and we really [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=310.76s)]
*  do want people to have as much of an unrestricted level of access as we can enable. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=315.6s)]
*  And for us, it's really a learning experience. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=321.76s)]
*  It's about how do we integrate it into the health care system, the education system? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  How do we help the country and the government offer services to citizens more efficiently [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=327.32s)]
*  than they do? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=331.24s)]
*  So all those things are in scope, and we're just at the beginning of this, but more to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=332.24s)]
*  come. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=337.88s)]
*  So chat GPT has been growing super fast. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=338.88s)]
*  I'll rattle off some stats here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=340.88s)]
*  Five billion monthly visits last month, right, up from 3.9, not long before that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=343.48s)]
*  250 million weekly active users. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  Or it's 500. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=351.64s)]
*  500, sorry. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=352.64s)]
*  Active users. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=353.64s)]
*  And the enterprise business, which you've really been focusing on, had two million paying [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=355.2s)]
*  customers a few months ago. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=359.48s)]
*  So that would suggest there's a lot of room to grow the enterprise part. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=361.56s)]
*  Can you help us understand how much of OpenAI's current business is enterprise and how you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=366.28s)]
*  see that moving over the next, say, five years? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=371.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  So enterprise obviously has a little bit of a different growth curve than consumer. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  Any person in the world can pick up chat GPT and use it at their will. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=377.96s)]
*  Certainly we've seen that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=381.92s)]
*  500 million people using it every week has been kind of a crazy, crazy ride for us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  Businesses obviously have a different need set. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=388.24s)]
*  There's a different level of adoption, a different rate of growth. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  We are growing quite fast in the enterprise. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=392.58s)]
*  So at current, actually, chat GPT enterprise and our kind of surrounding chat GPT work [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=394.48s)]
*  products are at about 3 million seats. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=399.04s)]
*  So up from 2 million in February. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=402.12s)]
*  So quite a bit of growth, about 50% growth in three months. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  And the demand we see is off the charts. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=408.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think what we're starting to see really are diverse and interesting examples of how [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=409.8s)]
*  chat GPT and tools like it are starting to penetrate in the enterprise, in education, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=414.8s)]
*  in healthcare. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=419.56s)]
*  Some examples, we work very closely with CSU in California. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=421.24s)]
*  We've deployed chat GPT, we'll deploy it to about 500,000 students in California. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=425.2s)]
*  So it'll be kind of the first AI powered university system, I think, in the country, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=430.36s)]
*  which is super exciting. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=434.4s)]
*  Used for everything from curriculum planning, lesson planning, to job preparation, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=435.88s)]
*  to personalized learning. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=442.16s)]
*  I mean, these are all things we're kind of experimenting with in partnership with CSU. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=444.48s)]
*  All the way to examples like in healthcare, where we work very closely with Moderna, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=448.52s)]
*  for example. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  Totally different use case, but you have the same technology that's capable of kind of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=453.64s)]
*  powering both of these institutions. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  And so we're excited about it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  I think the growth we're trying to just keep up. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=461.4s)]
*  We're still a smallish team. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=463.56s)]
*  But I suspect if we continue to grow at that rate, there's something really special there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=465.52s)]
*  So how are you competing with these companies like Microsoft and Google that have this whole [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=469.9s)]
*  cloud business behind them, which you don't have? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  So what is the special sauce that you can offer that they can't? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=476.8s)]
*  We really live and breathe our models. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=480.18s)]
*  I mean, there's something really valuable about being that close to the model training [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=481.56s)]
*  process, to the design. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=486.32s)]
*  We obviously are probably the most active consumers of our own models. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=489.12s)]
*  We try and build open AI on open AI as much as we can. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=492.24s)]
*  And so therein, I think you develop familiarity with how these models work, kind of like what [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=495.62s)]
*  are the things they're really good at, what are the things they're not good at. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=500.16s)]
*  It's very easy when they don't work to call support, because it's like the guy sitting [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=502.92s)]
*  next to you, and to basically kind of do that in a very iterative way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=505.4s)]
*  And that really is, I think, the core of it, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  It's like AI is a completely new paradigm of product building. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=512.4s)]
*  How the model gets integrated into the product, into the UX, the UI, all of those things take [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  a tremendous amount of care and a tremendous amount of thought that I think it just is [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=521.04s)]
*  so important to be deeply integrated, tightly integrated with the research. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=527.24s)]
*  And I think that's kind of what makes open AI unique, is we really do take that vantage [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=531.12s)]
*  point. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=534.68s)]
*  So I think open AI has been pretty open about the fact that that $200 price point for the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=535.68s)]
*  consumer product, the sort of top-of-the-line Cadillac, is not a winner, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  You lose money at that $200 price point. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  We're doing better now. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=549.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=550.68s)]
*  So if there is any updates, that's interesting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=551.68s)]
*  And also, what kind of price points can we think about going forward? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=552.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, people thought we were crazy when we introduced a $200 price point. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  So if anyone here has spent time in consumer technology, especially consumer subscriptions, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=561.6s)]
*  like $20 is like the magic number. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=567.48s)]
*  It's like you cannot go above $20 and expect people to pay for something. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=569.28s)]
*  Typically people start there and actually try and go down. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=574.16s)]
*  And everyone asks, by the way, like how did you guys even come up with $20 as the price [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=577.4s)]
*  point? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=580.4s)]
*  Like the answer is like Sam and I were like, I don't know, pick a number. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=581.4s)]
*  $20 sounds good. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  OK, let's do it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  And that was kind of how we came up with $200 as well. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=584.98s)]
*  And the reason, by the way, that we did that, again, very much in the spirit of being experimental, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=587.48s)]
*  was we saw, if you look at the distribution of use of chat GPT users, it is highly, there's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  an extreme power law at work. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=599.8s)]
*  So if you look at the far right side of that graph, there's a handful of people that use [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=601.76s)]
*  chat GPT at levels that far exceed what the kind of median or average is in the rest of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=606.16s)]
*  the user base. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=613.0s)]
*  And so there are these like insane power users that like just hammer the thing all day. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=614.04s)]
*  And so we were like, well, I don't know. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=618.76s)]
*  What is the product for them? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  And we have real costs when we serve these models. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  And so we're like, I don't know. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  If we want to serve them, we probably have to charge something like $200 a month. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=626.2399999999999s)]
*  And we kind of like all stared at each other around the room and were like, should we just [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  launch $200 a month? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=633.0s)]
*  And we did. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=634.0s)]
*  And now it's growing very quickly. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=635.0s)]
*  Any other prices that we can expect? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=637.56s)]
*  $2,000. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=639.9599999999999s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  You didn't hear that from me. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  OK, so Sam Walman has said that AGI is coming in the second Trump administration. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=644.4799999999999s)]
*  Are you still on track for that? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=649.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, AGI is a definitionally challenging thing. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=650.44s)]
*  The joke is like if you ask five researchers at OpenAI what AGI is, you get seven answers. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=655.28s)]
*  And so something that feels like AGI, or at least approximates what would be a commonly [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=661.6s)]
*  understood definition of AGI, I think it is possible that in the next four years we do [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=666.7s)]
*  approximate something like that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=672.36s)]
*  And it's a testament to how fast things are moving and also the cycle we're in right now. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=674.88s)]
*  And so it's worth spending maybe a second on that is the reasoning models that we're [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=678.34s)]
*  building today are improving at a rate that's dramatically faster than the old paradigm [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=682.7800000000001s)]
*  of models. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=687.34s)]
*  So the GPT series of models that you're probably familiar with, GPT-3, GPT-4, we used to cycle [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=688.34s)]
*  time on those between generations at call it 12 to 18 months. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=694.22s)]
*  There are these big pre-training efforts that kind of take time and investment. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=698.7s)]
*  The O series of models, that's a much more condensed period of innovation. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=702.36s)]
*  So for that, it's probably order of months, not years. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=706.86s)]
*  And so the rate of change and the ability for these models to generalize learning context [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=711.74s)]
*  and really reason about how to solve hard problems, use tools to do it, it's not yet [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=717.5s)]
*  I think a well understood thing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=723.34s)]
*  People still kind of use these models very much like chatbots. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=725.98s)]
*  They're just Oracle systems. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=728.58s)]
*  But once you kind of enter this more agentic phase of AI and with the rate of improvement [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=730.3s)]
*  we're seeing in the models, I think you do stand to kind of see this fairly steep takeoff [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=734.26s)]
*  and capability. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=738.1s)]
*  And if I'm a CIO trying to plan for this, how do I plan for a post-AGI future? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=739.1s)]
*  Because I have to plan more than five years out. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=743.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=747.5s)]
*  That's the hardest part of our job. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=748.62s)]
*  We partner closely with enterprises and I think our disposition when we do that is very [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=750.46s)]
*  much not, hey, we sell you a service. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=754.86s)]
*  It's hey, how do you kind of join the journey with us? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=757.34s)]
*  How do you get on the train with us? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=760.22s)]
*  The thing that we're talking about a year from now is not going to be the thing we're [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=762.62s)]
*  talking about today. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=765.46s)]
*  And then two years from now is not going to be the thing from a year prior. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=766.46s)]
*  And so it is this fluency that we have to build with the customers that we work with. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=770.5s)]
*  And we spent a lot of time and care trying to do that and establish that baseline. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=774.1800000000001s)]
*  We worked, for example, very closely with Morgan Stanley. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=778.62s)]
*  We've worked with them for a few years. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=781.62s)]
*  And for a big legacy financial institution, they're actually remarkably sophisticated in [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  their use of AI. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  But it took them kind of two years to establish that baseline. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=788.68s)]
*  And so that's a lot of the guidance that we give to enterprises is like it's not a bad [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=792.2399999999999s)]
*  time to just at least start the investment process. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=795.5999999999999s)]
*  You just have to start to build fluency. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=798.88s)]
*  You've got to build muscle memory in the organization. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=800.52s)]
*  You've got to just build a familiarity with the rate of change because it's very steep. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=802.8199999999999s)]
*  Unlike past technological revolutions, it's something that is going to change over time. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=806.56s)]
*  Cloud computing hasn't changed that much in the last few years. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=811.52s)]
*  Mobile phones haven't changed that much in the last few years. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=813.8s)]
*  This is something that will be categorically different in a few years. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=816.2s)]
*  And so it's the hard part, but it's also the fun part. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=819.32s)]
*  So talking about this moment of AGI, we've all reported that in your partnership with [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=821.48s)]
*  Microsoft, key partner, there's this provision where basically Microsoft is not going to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=827.0s)]
*  get access to your tech after you declare AGI. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  Do you imagine some future where they will be able to participate financially or as a [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=836.88s)]
*  business in a post-AGI OpenAI technology given what early and important partners they were? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=843.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, I would say we tend to not discuss terms of our engagements with partners. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=850.04s)]
*  Two things, though. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=856.28s)]
*  One is they're a meaningful owner in OpenAI. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=857.28s)]
*  And so regardless, they're along for the ride. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=858.68s)]
*  And they've been an amazing supporter of the company as an investor and as a partner. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=862.4399999999999s)]
*  And I suspect that will continue. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=867.52s)]
*  The partnership will evolve, but I expect the substance of what we really set up to [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=868.92s)]
*  succeed five years ago will continue. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=874.16s)]
*  The second thing I'll say is we've got to kind of take a whole-of-company approach and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=877.88s)]
*  somewhat kind of a whole-of-ecosystem approach to making AGI work. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  One of the things we didn't appreciate when we set up OpenAI really early on is just how [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=885.76s)]
*  externalized the process of building OpenAI and AGI is going to be. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=890.16s)]
*  We kind of thought we could go off in a lab and if we thought hard enough and focused [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=895.0s)]
*  hard enough and had enough computers, we would kind of go invent the thing and then wake [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=899.0400000000001s)]
*  up one day and be like, here you go, everyone. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=902.76s)]
*  We have AGI. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=904.64s)]
*  And the reality has been very different. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=906.02s)]
*  It's been this highly iterative, highly collaborative approach to building that takes an understanding [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=907.46s)]
*  of what do users care about? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  What do businesses care about? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=914.1s)]
*  How do people engage with these systems? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=915.4000000000001s)]
*  What are they really good at? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=917.34s)]
*  What are they not good at? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=918.34s)]
*  How do we actually hill climb on those problems? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=919.38s)]
*  And so I suspect that's not going to change. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=921.2s)]
*  Microsoft's been an amazing partner in helping increase that exposure to the world and helping [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=923.96s)]
*  us improve the models given what they understand about their customers. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=929.44s)]
*  So it's a solid foundation for that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=932.9200000000001s)]
*  And I suspect many years to come of great partnership. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=935.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=938.84s)]
*  You've led a lot of these deals with publishers, including one of the deals that our paper [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=939.84s)]
*  and our company has with OpenAI. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  How does OpenAI think about how to value the content the publishers have, both for training [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=949.46s)]
*  and for inference? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=953.84s)]
*  And how do you decide what you need to license and what you don't? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=954.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=957.88s)]
*  So we have now a whole handful of partnerships with different publishers and different news [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=958.88s)]
*  and media organizations. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=964.4s)]
*  Those have been kind of amazing partnerships in that I think news and information was really [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=966.28s)]
*  one of the first areas that AI touched. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=972.0400000000001s)]
*  It was all of a sudden you've got these systems that have the kind of the world's accumulated [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=974.96s)]
*  knowledge stored somewhere in their mathematical weights. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=979.16s)]
*  And people kind of use them differently. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=984.64s)]
*  You have this kind of infinite learning machine. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=986.64s)]
*  And inevitably that kind of touches external content. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=989.36s)]
*  It's like you want to be able to say, OK, I want to learn about what the tariffs are. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=992.04s)]
*  I want to be able to learn about what's going on in Asia. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  I want to learn why the you know what's going on in South America at this exact moment. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=999.92s)]
*  And so part of the challenge we had early on was our models have a cutoff date. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1005.8s)]
*  We train them. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  And once they're done training, they're done training for the most part. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1011.9599999999999s)]
*  And so their knowledge only goes up to a certain point. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1015.0799999999999s)]
*  And so we started doing these deals basically to kind of extend the model's knowledge into [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  current events, into news and more kind of current media. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1022.8s)]
*  But also because it gives the models color. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1028.9199999999998s)]
*  It gives them perspective that they don't have. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1030.9199999999998s)]
*  They're averages of human preference. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1033.48s)]
*  But you as a reporter may have a different or unique vantage point on something that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1035.8000000000002s)]
*  actually supplements someone's understanding of a topic. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1040.72s)]
*  And we want to be able to enable that experience because these models are also really good [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  at directing people to that content. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1048.72s)]
*  And that's what we do in practice today in search. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1051.2s)]
*  I think the misconception somewhat was that we were doing these deals as training deals. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1053.48s)]
*  We were not actually really explicitly doing these deals as training deals. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1057.68s)]
*  I think if you added up all the content in the world from all of the publishers and kind [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1060.4s)]
*  of put it in a bucket and handed it to OpenAI and said, here you go, train on this, it would [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1064.96s)]
*  amount to something like less than 1.1% of the total content that we need to train a [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1069.56s)]
*  model like GPT-4, let alone GPT-5 or anything better. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1074.56s)]
*  So it's not a meaningful source of training data for us. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1078.48s)]
*  I think what is really meaningful is it's a source of reference information. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1081.08s)]
*  It's a connection point to the external world. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1086.52s)]
*  And I think that's an important thing to have. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1088.28s)]
*  Do you ever imagine doing it with local publications? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1091.28s)]
*  We do work very closely with local publications. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1094.3s)]
*  So we have a variety of efforts that are really actually meant to support local publishers [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1096.08s)]
*  because that's in some sense kind of the hardest information to find. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1101.1s)]
*  If I live in Topeka, Kansas, what's going on in Topeka is kind of as relevant as anything [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1104.02s)]
*  else. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1109.8999999999999s)]
*  And one of the things we hear often as a use case is people saying, oh, I want to plan [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1110.8999999999999s)]
*  my weekend. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1114.4199999999998s)]
*  I've got a two-year-old and a five-year-old, and I want to give them activities to do over [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1115.4199999999998s)]
*  the weekend. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1119.1399999999999s)]
*  to know kind of what's going on in your community and whatnot. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1121.5s)]
*  So even purely for the value of our users, that type of engagement is critical. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1124.38s)]
*  And we're working with Axios and a few others on initiatives meant to actually help use [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1128.74s)]
*  AI to revitalize a lot of the local news industries that today are kind of facing some structural [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1133.06s)]
*  difficulty. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1137.9s)]
*  So we've heard that you've been out in Hollywood a lot, talking to a lot of folks, but there [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1138.9s)]
*  haven't been many deals out of Hollywood. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1143.62s)]
*  Why not? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1146.42s)]
*  So a lot of what we do is engagement, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1148.54s)]
*  I think to start any conversation with AI is kind of an it starts with an education process. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1151.1799999999998s)]
*  Like this stuff's all really new. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1156.22s)]
*  There's a baseline level of trust and understanding that you have to build with partners before [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1158.6999999999998s)]
*  you engage just as to what it is that you're doing. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1163.3s)]
*  Like what is it you're building? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1165.5s)]
*  Who are we as OpenAI? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1167.3s)]
*  What do we stand for? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1168.3s)]
*  And I think with a lot of the things that kind of touch Hollywood, so video modeling, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1170.4199999999998s)]
*  you know, et cetera, there are things that are still kind of in their infancy as technologies. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1175.1s)]
*  We released a model called Sora, is a generative video model, was the first really kind of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1179.5s)]
*  high quality generative video model to come out. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1183.46s)]
*  And we really released the first version as kind of a research preview. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1186.42s)]
*  You can use it, you can access it today and people can play with it, but it's not meant [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1190.14s)]
*  for production level content. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1193.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not, in my opinion, good enough for that yet. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1195.42s)]
*  So will it get better? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1197.46s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1199.14s)]
*  But it's just starting a dialogue and starting a process of understanding how are people [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1200.7s)]
*  wanting to use these tools? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1204.7s)]
*  How do the creative communities think about these tools? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1206.0600000000002s)]
*  For the most part, we've actually been able to, I think, enhance the creative workflow. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1208.38s)]
*  We work very closely with a lot of filmmakers who've started trying to use Sora to make [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1211.42s)]
*  films. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1215.38s)]
*  They all went from kind of skeptics at first, I think, to at the end kind of saying there's [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1216.38s)]
*  no way I would ever make a film without actually wanting this thing sitting by my side. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1220.3400000000001s)]
*  So that's valuable learning for us and that's kind of the phase we're in. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1223.98s)]
*  So we talk a little bit about agents. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1227.6200000000001s)]
*  You've been releasing some agents, this Operator One, which is a research preview. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1229.5800000000002s)]
*  We all know what it means when OpenAI releases a research preview, right? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1233.9s)]
*  A low-key research preview. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1238.26s)]
*  That's what Chat GPT was. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
*  That's how it worked out for us. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1241.8600000000001s)]
*  What has the usage been and uptake and what are people really using them for? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1243.8600000000001s)]
*  How much usage are you seeing of the agents, both for coding and other stuff? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1247.54s)]
*  So agents is a little all over the map. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1252.06s)]
*  So operators specifically, very early. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1254.98s)]
*  And for those of you who don't know, operator is a system that basically allows an AI to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1259.22s)]
*  use a computer the way that a person would use a computer. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1262.54s)]
*  So it can click around. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1265.38s)]
*  It's got a mouse and a keyboard. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1266.66s)]
*  It can move around, control applications, control the web and so on. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1268.3400000000001s)]
*  And it is really early for that type of agent at least. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1272.8600000000001s)]
*  But we think it's going to be a critical part of the future. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1278.3400000000001s)]
*  And the right way to kind of roughly, in my opinion, think about agents is you're going [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1281.02s)]
*  from an AI system that has what I would call kind of wide and diverse factual knowledge [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1285.8200000000002s)]
*  to AI systems that have wide and diverse ability to reason. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1291.54s)]
*  So they can think really hard about a problem and actually come up with, in some sense, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1296.26s)]
*  new ideas or new knowledge about a topic. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1300.5s)]
*  And also can think about how to solve a problem. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1303.26s)]
*  So critically, in their chain of thought, you can actually see how they start to map [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1305.3s)]
*  out a strategy to go actually execute a task. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1309.5s)]
*  That's all well and good. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  But it's all kind of like, it's all words basically until you actually let the systems [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1316.58s)]
*  go off and use tools to do the thing. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1321.26s)]
*  So that's kind of the state we're in right now. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1324.38s)]
*  That's kind of the phase we're in now is this transition from what would be kind of purely [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1326.14s)]
*  chat bots and reasoning models into what really are more agentic AI systems that can use tools, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1330.38s)]
*  solve problems, execute tasks, write code, control computers, and basically string all [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1337.46s)]
*  these capabilities together end to end to actually solve fairly complex problems. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1343.8600000000001s)]
*  So you were part of the deal to buy the rest of Johnny Ive's company, I.O., and bring them [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1348.94s)]
*  aboard OpenAI. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1358.2600000000002s)]
*  And Johnny, of course, the famous designer who designed all these beautiful Apple products. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1359.8600000000001s)]
*  It seems, I was just at the Apple Store yesterday getting a new iPhone, and the salesman was [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  so excited he preloaded the new action button with ChatGPT. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1370.18s)]
*  But it's very clear that there still is a button. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1374.14s)]
*  But you were still basically at Apple's mercy. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1376.7s)]
*  And I'm curious if the future of OpenAI is going to be one where you will need to have [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1379.74s)]
*  a direct relationship with your customer, not through some other tech company, but direct. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1384.78s)]
*  Is that necessary for success? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1391.06s)]
*  Well what I would say is I think there's like an incredible opportunity to build an entirely [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1394.14s)]
*  new class of devices. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1398.7s)]
*  And I think every time you kind of get a change in the underlying computing platform, you [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1399.7s)]
*  tend to get kind of a corresponding change in the types of devices people use to engage [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1405.1s)]
*  with that platform. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1409.1s)]
*  So when we kind of originally had the mainframe, but the PC was invented, turned into mobile [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1410.26s)]
*  phones, on-prem systems, big monolithic cloud, on-prem systems turned into cloud systems, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1416.58s)]
*  and distributed architectures. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1423.58s)]
*  Same thing with AI. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1425.4599999999998s)]
*  You've got an entirely new substrate that really lets you do things that you couldn't [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1426.4599999999998s)]
*  do with the more traditional kind of computing methods of years past. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1430.3799999999999s)]
*  And so we think that there is going to be a kind of a corresponding set of devices that [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1434.7s)]
*  gets built. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1437.82s)]
*  I think for us what it represents is actually an interesting challenge of how do you now [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1439.38s)]
*  start to build AI that really is truly personal. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1443.42s)]
*  Chat GPT is great, but to your point, it's just an app on your phone. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1447.8600000000001s)]
*  You have to kind of go in and you've got to kind of input something. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1451.74s)]
*  There's a lot of inertia to kind of be able to use it and get value from it. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1454.98s)]
*  But so much of the way that we actually engage with people and do things happens in the real [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1459.02s)]
*  world. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1463.26s)]
*  It happens in places that don't involve us necessarily just staring at a screen. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1464.26s)]
*  And so I think a lot of the inspiration for the types of things that we feel like we can [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1468.54s)]
*  build will be the types of systems that are more ambient, right? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1472.02s)]
*  They're more, in some sense, almost feel more personal. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1477.5s)]
*  They detach you a little bit from having to always be looking at a screen. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1481.14s)]
*  I think there's a place for a phone and I think there's a place for apps and whatnot. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1485.22s)]
*  But the way that we kind of look at the problem statement is very much an emphasis on personal [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1488.66s)]
*  computing and how we kind of build this ambient computing layer. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1493.66s)]
*  And it's interesting from an AI research perspective too because there's a lot that we have to [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1498.18s)]
*  do to develop models to succeed in that environment. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1502.14s)]
*  Like the real world is super messy. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1505.0600000000002s)]
*  And so how do you have models that kind of run this parallel track, for example, of like [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1507.28s)]
*  social reasoning? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1510.66s)]
*  How do they know who I'm talking to? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1512.5800000000002s)]
*  How do they know our relationship? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1514.1200000000001s)]
*  Maybe I want to say things to you that I wouldn't want to say to someone else, right? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1515.8200000000002s)]
*  Or maybe if I'm present with family members, the tone of engagement is going to be different [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1520.06s)]
*  than if I'm with colleagues. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1524.4199999999998s)]
*  All that stuff is actually part of the intelligence spectrum. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1526.2s)]
*  And I think you have to kind of have a device that is going to be acknowledging of the fact [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1529.3799999999999s)]
*  that we are going to want to understand that better. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1533.78s)]
*  So do you know what the device is? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1539.1399999999999s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1541.6599999999999s)]
*  There's nothing we could say to squeeze it out of you? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1544.58s)]
*  Don't ask me earlier if it was an orb. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1547.02s)]
*  It seems kind of like maybe an Alexa from what we know so far. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1550.34s)]
*  Close? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1554.06s)]
*  No comment. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1555.06s)]
*  But this is exploratory. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1556.06s)]
*  I mean, it is truly experimental. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1557.06s)]
*  It's truly kind of cutting edge in that sense. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1559.46s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a lot of versions of it that we go through before we feel good [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1561.3799999999999s)]
*  about it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1565.7s)]
*  OK. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1566.7s)]
*  One last thing, because we don't have much time left. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1567.7s)]
*  But I want to end on ROI. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1569.7s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1572.5s)]
*  But I feel like this is really whether or not... [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1573.5s)]
*  It's the Wall Street Journal. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1575.5s)]
*  This is where the rubber hits the road. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1576.98s)]
*  So I have been constantly searching for examples of productivity gains by people using AI. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1577.98s)]
*  And I was asking Chet to be here today. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1584.1s)]
*  And it was like, oh, here's Nvidia's stock price. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1585.74s)]
*  I'm like, no, no. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1587.7s)]
*  I don't want people paying for AI. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1588.7s)]
*  I want people using it and getting productivity gains back end. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1589.86s)]
*  So what are some of the best examples? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1593.18s)]
*  And how do people measure the ROI of these things that you're trying to sell them? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1594.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1599.66s)]
*  This is actually one of the hardest things that we have to deal with is AI being kind [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1600.66s)]
*  of this enabling layer of technology. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1604.82s)]
*  It's actually... [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1607.26s)]
*  Everyone uses it a little differently. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1608.78s)]
*  And in some sense, you get varying level of acceleration. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1610.86s)]
*  So you get 2% here, 10% here, 2x there. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1613.28s)]
*  And it's very spiky. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1618.46s)]
*  So just to give you maybe some data points that might help contextualize it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1620.02s)]
*  Most startups now, I think, if you kind of flew to San Francisco and took a poll, would [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1624.86s)]
*  say that the majority of code they're writing is actually written either in partnership [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1628.54s)]
*  with or completely by AIs. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1633.3s)]
*  That is an amazing thing. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1634.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1635.9s)]
*  AI is amazingly good at coding. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1636.9s)]
*  And so the types of productivity gains you get, and these are all kind of... [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1637.9s)]
*  It's kind of all ANIC data. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1640.82s)]
*  So it's all self-reported. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1641.94s)]
*  But it would be probably software engineers saying something between a 50% speed up and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1643.06s)]
*  a 2x speed up in their kind of total output. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1648.42s)]
*  And that number is only going up. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1651.3s)]
*  You see similar things kind of ancillary to that. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1653.54s)]
*  So things like data science, quantitative fields like trading where people have to process [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1655.78s)]
*  a lot of information quickly, a lot of the same benefit. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1660.6599999999999s)]
*  Interestingly, actually, creativity also is an amazingly kind of powerful area for AIs. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1664.22s)]
*  So the way that creatives are using the systems to improve their rate of iteration, kind of [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1669.6599999999999s)]
*  use it as an idea partner, as a thought generation partner, has been an accelerant to that field. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1674.86s)]
*  And then there are others where I think the more kind of agentic version of AI is going [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1680.1799999999998s)]
*  to have to exist before you see the real speed up. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1684.46s)]
*  You're going to need systems that can manage across a lot of other pieces of software, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1687.06s)]
*  a lot of data, a lot of context, and then be able to use tools to kind of use all that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1690.98s)]
*  effectively to solve problems. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1695.58s)]
*  So it's varied. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1697.42s)]
*  It's diverse. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1699.78s)]
*  We get asked all the time for, give me the ROI case. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1700.78s)]
*  And usually what I say is, do you use TachyPT yourself? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1704.1399999999999s)]
*  And of course the answer is yes. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1708.1399999999999s)]
*  And I always say, well, it's what's your personal story? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1711.02s)]
*  And just go and understand that across your team. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1713.98s)]
*  The power users distill what they're kind of using it for across your functions and [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1716.76s)]
*  try and kind of tell that story as qualitatively as you can. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQE1gPjUDE&t=1721.8s)]
