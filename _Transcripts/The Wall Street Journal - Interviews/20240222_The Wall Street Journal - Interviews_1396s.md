# Moderna Co-Founder and Flagship Pioneering CEO on the Future of Biotech | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY)
*  So, biotech. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=0.0s)]
*  Biotech has had a bit of a rough year. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=2.6s)]
*  There have been layoffs and closures, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=4.8s)]
*  reduced number of IPOs and venture capital investment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=7.36s)]
*  And you in your annual letter spoke about the poly crisis, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=10.88s)]
*  other headwinds that we were facing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=14.56s)]
*  But you also spoke about something you called paranoid optimism. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=16.88s)]
*  I think I get the paranoid part. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=21.2s)]
*  Where does the optimism come from? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=23.32s)]
*  Well, first thanks for having me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  Like, I think optimism is about belief in a better future. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=28.88s)]
*  And I think we're all innately optimistic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=33.08s)]
*  It's just that the reality causes us to question it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=36.16s)]
*  And that's where the paranoia comes in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=39.0s)]
*  So I think nobody doing science, nobody doing any kind of discovery [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=40.56s)]
*  or creative work isn't propelled somewhat by optimism [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=45.12s)]
*  because they're trying to make something better. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  The doctor is trying to make something better. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=50.92s)]
*  What motivates them to do that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=52.92s)]
*  You could say impact, but the beginning of the impulse [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=54.2s)]
*  is just an optimism that they can do it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=56.96s)]
*  So I think that those two elements, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=59.64s)]
*  mindsets of paranoia and optimism, when married, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=62.52s)]
*  allow you to cautiously explore novelty, which [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=66.0s)]
*  is kind of what science is and what biotechnology is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=68.88s)]
*  So I've long viewed that mindset to be crucial. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=71.36s)]
*  And of course, periods of time, economic difficulties, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  other difficulties make it easier or harder to do this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=79.12s)]
*  But in both of those times, you have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=82.6s)]
*  to have both paranoia and optimism. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=84.16s)]
*  It's a gas pedal and a brake pedal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  And then you get the steering wheel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=87.64s)]
*  But ultimately, if you don't have those two devices, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  you're going to be reckless. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  So you have, I think, 44 companies and scientists [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  exploring many, many more targets and molecular pathways [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  as possibilities. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  And I wonder, what are the ones that you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=101.56s)]
*  are the most optimistic about? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=104.28s)]
*  Could you give us your top one, two, three what-ifs, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=105.56s)]
*  as I think you like to call them? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=108.96s)]
*  Well, that's an impossible task for me, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=110.76s)]
*  because as soon as I say that, all the other ones [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  will immediately conclude that they did something wrong. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And so the reality is that we have the luxury [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=119.72s)]
*  or the kind of lunacy of working on totally unprecedented things, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  which by at birth could be transformative if only they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=129.68s)]
*  could be real. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=133.4s)]
*  And so every one of them is a journey [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=134.56s)]
*  to figure out how real it can be, how scalable it can be, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=136.72s)]
*  and can it become that in an affordable timeline and cost. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=139.96s)]
*  And we are, in a way, in the disappointment business, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  because we go in assuming that we can do that, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  and we put a lot of resources and resourcefulness [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=150.88s)]
*  into the task and a lot of adaptation along the way [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=154.52s)]
*  to kind of change direction, try to figure it out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  And if we succeed, it hopefully becomes a big deal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  An extreme example of that, at least in the last few years, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=163.28s)]
*  has been Moderna in the sense that it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  was the result of 10 years of platform development, which [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=168.48s)]
*  then seemed like an overnight success when the pandemic hit. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=173.0s)]
*  But the reality is there was $2.5 billion [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=175.92s)]
*  and 10 years of work that went into it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  All of our other companies have similar journeys [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=179.88s)]
*  of trying to establish totally new platforms. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=182.56s)]
*  And so it's hard in the beginning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  I could describe any one of these [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=187.16s)]
*  in a way that could be a big deal if only there's a cartoon, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=189.32s)]
*  by the way, that I used to use a long time ago that once [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=193.76s)]
*  in a while I pull out, which is just imagine these two people [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=196.48s)]
*  in the sand in the desert, and they have found a tiny little kind [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=199.84s)]
*  of pyramid-looking thing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=203.16s)]
*  And then somebody goes, this might be the find [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=206.16s)]
*  of the century, depending on how far down it goes, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=208.64s)]
*  Because otherwise, it could just be a little pyramid of nothing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so that mindset I've always found to be the mindset [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  of an entrepreneur. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=218.72s)]
*  You have to assume it goes way down, but you have to be prepared [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=220.0s)]
*  for the fact that it doesn't. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=223.16s)]
*  Well, you mentioned Moderna. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=224.64s)]
*  Does the success of Moderna and the place you're in now, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  which was different than perhaps it was a few years ago, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=230.16s)]
*  has it changed all the way you think about, say, your risk tolerance [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=233.16s)]
*  or the scale at which you want to approach things? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, I would say that so Moderna, before COVID hit, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  had 22 products in clinical development. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=243.2s)]
*  It now has 50. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=245.88s)]
*  Twenty-two products was significantly larger [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  than pretty much any biotech company in that stage of development. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, we won't know what would have happened [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=254.12s)]
*  without the pandemic. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=257.08s)]
*  We would have certainly not had quite the resources, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=258.4s)]
*  and we wouldn't have had to be able to go as quickly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=261.88s)]
*  But also, we wouldn't have been able to enter into hundreds [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  of millions of humans. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  So one of the things that flipped there was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=268.6s)]
*  that you took a technology that had not been in humans, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=270.92s)]
*  but for a few hundred people we had tested it on previously [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=273.24s)]
*  to now having hundreds of millions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=276.52s)]
*  So if you want to think about safety and how to think [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=277.92s)]
*  about expanding the range of applications. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=281.72s)]
*  So that changed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=283.32s)]
*  How does that affect how we think about it? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know that our risk tolerance has increased [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=286.4s)]
*  or decreased our awareness of all the things [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  that can impact success. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=291.44s)]
*  For example, scale. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=293.2s)]
*  Just how do you scale that quickly? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=294.52s)]
*  How do you go from 500 people to 6,000 people in a couple of years? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=295.84s)]
*  Those are unique, unique challenges [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=299.88s)]
*  of that particular journey. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=301.56s)]
*  But there are other things that we've learned from Moderna [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=303.36s)]
*  that are benefiting a lot of our other companies. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=305.92s)]
*  So, for example, Moderna was very early [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=307.76s)]
*  in doing strategic partnerships. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=310.28s)]
*  And we observed that closely and we thought it's unique to them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=312.24s)]
*  Today, much of the time I spend on helping our companies is all [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=315.84s)]
*  about making strategic partnership [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=320.8s)]
*  with large pharma companies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=322.0s)]
*  Because what I've concluded is that in the end a platform [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=323.08s)]
*  to become a real kind of a long-term success, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=326.96s)]
*  you need to be linked to the incumbents in the field. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  And so we're prioritizing that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=333.36s)]
*  And we got a lot of that learning [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=335.12s)]
*  from the experience with Moderna. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=336.36s)]
*  So one of the, I think a couple [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=337.72s)]
*  of strategic partnerships involve Nova Nordisk, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  the maker of, say it with me, Ozempic. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=343.2s)]
*  That's a very different kind of company than your startups. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=345.68s)]
*  It's a much older, much, it's a European company owned [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=349.88s)]
*  by a foundation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=353.76s)]
*  It has a very Danish culture. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=355.08s)]
*  How do you make relationships like that work between startups [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=356.64s)]
*  that need to stay nimble but working [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=360.16s)]
*  with the established big pharmas that have a different way [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=361.6s)]
*  of doing business and maybe take longer? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, Nova is a company that anybody [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=368.96s)]
*  in this field has known for a long time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=372.76s)]
*  And, you know, very Danish is an advantage or a disadvantage, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  depending on how well they do. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=379.96s)]
*  Turns out these days it's an advantage. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=381.4s)]
*  And so I would say that one of the things you learn [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=383.2s)]
*  in doing startups is you really have [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  to understand the ecosystem you're working in. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=389.52s)]
*  And inevitably a company [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=391.56s)]
*  like Nova has been a long-term oriented kind of dominant [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  in knowing about diseases, in diabetes, metabolic disease. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=398.04s)]
*  And there's no substitute for that level of knowledge [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=402.0s)]
*  of the unmet needs and approaches and staying power. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=406.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the fact that they're owned by a foundation [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=409.44000000000005s)]
*  or a holding company, the fact [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  that they have this hundred-year commitment [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=413.04s)]
*  to this disease has its advantages, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  which is that if there is something that it takes 17 tries [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=416.92s)]
*  to get to work, they'll be there at the 17th. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=420.16s)]
*  Most people give up after the third, let alone [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=422.52s)]
*  if they have quarterly reports to investors that kind of say, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  well, this isn't working, you should move on [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=427.52s)]
*  and do another disease. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=429.12s)]
*  So I obviously have great respect for them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=430.32s)]
*  And I think that in an interesting way, I think of what we do [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=433.4s)]
*  as a form of kind of scientific insurgency. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  I think what they do is incumbency. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=440.2s)]
*  And these two things, rather than being [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=442.88s)]
*  at odds, are actually quite complementary [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=444.4s)]
*  if they can work together. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=446.08s)]
*  Because an incumbent ultimately relies on insurgence [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=447.68s)]
*  to take the kind of risks that they cannot take quite as early. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=450.88s)]
*  And yet insurgents often think [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=454.4s)]
*  about replacing the incumbent as their objective. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=456.35999999999996s)]
*  And in many ways, if you build enough value, there's ways [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=458.96s)]
*  to share that value and continue to be an insurgent [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=461.52s)]
*  in lots of other directions. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=464.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's kind of how we view our role is that we think, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=465.67999999999995s)]
*  what we've built at Flagship is a network of insurgents, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=468.23999999999995s)]
*  each of them trying to take on some unprecedented thing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  If they happen to succeed, then now they are showered [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  with massive challenges of scale and resourcing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=477.44s)]
*  And those are the things [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=481.52s)]
*  where the partnerships can begin to make sense. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=482.64s)]
*  So we're experimenting, we're learning. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=484.64s)]
*  But I think that's more compatible than you might think. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=486.64s)]
*  What is less compatible is a slight variation [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=489.0s)]
*  of what already exists, which a startup wants to bring forward, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=491.72s)]
*  which the large company might as well do themselves [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=495.08s)]
*  because it's not that big a departure. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=497.08s)]
*  Those relationships tend to be more transactional as opposed [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=499.04s)]
*  to interactions, where we like interactions that can kind [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=502.56s)]
*  of transcend one or two years [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=505.8s)]
*  and really start sharing knowledge and sharing success. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, how do you make those interactions happen? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=511.48s)]
*  Do you have teams from the US startup that embed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=513.36s)]
*  in Denmark or vice versa? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=516.16s)]
*  Is it just a lot of Zoom calls? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=519.2s)]
*  How does that walk us through how [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=520.72s)]
*  those relationships really get built? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=523.04s)]
*  Well, so in this case, I guess maybe I'll be more specific. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=525.6s)]
*  We started three, four years ago internal to Flagship. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=530.84s)]
*  Flagship is known for building platform companies, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=533.96s)]
*  platforms in the biotech space are new modalities like mRNA, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=536.5999999999999s)]
*  new technologies, or for that matter, a new piece of biology [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  that once you develop mastery in can create many products. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what I mean by platform. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  It's one common investment, many products. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=550.4s)]
*  So one consequence of that is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=553.2399999999999s)]
*  that you're not going to develop all the products you can actually [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=554.88s)]
*  conceive because it just takes a lot of money and a lot of time [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  to do this in our space. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  So you now have an excess of potential inventory. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=560.92s)]
*  It's not real yet just because you have no, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=563.88s)]
*  so you need a way to get it out to have impact. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=565.92s)]
*  So the relationships that we forged first were preceded [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  by Flagship realizing we better have our own internal capability [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=571.68s)]
*  to develop drugs. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  And we started a program four years ago called Pioneering [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=576.0s)]
*  Medicines and that's now grown to almost 100 people. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=578.24s)]
*  These are all experts in drug development [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=581.56s)]
*  in different disease areas that joined us with a view [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=583.76s)]
*  towards taking individual programs and advancing them [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  to human clinical trials. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=589.36s)]
*  Once we did that, that entity looked much more recognizable [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=590.88s)]
*  to ENOVO, to a Pfizer, to others than our platforms do, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  which look like kind of novel foreign objects that kind of like, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=598.52s)]
*  we don't know if it's going to work. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=601.56s)]
*  And it's those teams that have forged these relationships. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=602.92s)]
*  So they're very collegial, very much about aligning [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  around what a target product profile would be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  that we could aim for. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=611.3599999999999s)]
*  Then we bring in some new platform capabilities to enable that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=612.68s)]
*  We have a bunch of stage gazed along the way. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=616.04s)]
*  And if things progress through stage gates, through shared risk, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=617.92s)]
*  shared rewards, we advance them into clinical development. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=621.04s)]
*  It's a, I, you know, this might be shocking to an audience [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=623.8s)]
*  that may not use the following words that I'm going to say, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  so brace yourself, but I view what we're trying to establish [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  as a notion of innovation supply chains. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=634.56s)]
*  So supply chains are thought of as manufacturing conceptions, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=637.8s)]
*  but actually I think the pharmaceutical industry [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=641.12s)]
*  is just as much about creating impact from innovation [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=642.92s)]
*  than any other industry. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  And yet, they don't think about often [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=647.52s)]
*  where are they getting these innovations. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=650.0s)]
*  They understand where they can buy products in licensing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=651.96s)]
*  But thinking about innovation supply chains saying, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=654.76s)]
*  how do we line up some upstream contributors of capabilities [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  and inventions that feed into our production plans [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=661.64s)]
*  and our pipeline? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=665.8000000000001s)]
*  That type of supply chain, the mutualism that's involved [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=667.2s)]
*  when an end manufacturer relies upon the innovations [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  of its suppliers, we don't see that a lot in our industry. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  And we're believers that if this is going to be a long-term game, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=677.52s)]
*  you really need to forge these relationships. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=681.76s)]
*  So that's kind of what we're playing with, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=683.6s)]
*  this notion of innovation supply chains. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you need to invest in and start those supply chain partners [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  yourself or can you partner with outsiders? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=690.04s)]
*  Well, we are wanting to establish these supply chains [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=692.96s)]
*  between our innovations and the pharma companies [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  as the equivalent of a car manufacturer. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=699.96s)]
*  In other words, the downstream or the apple of the world [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=702.24s)]
*  that relies upon innovations upstream, the pharma industry is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=705.16s)]
*  that for the way we're thinking about it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=708.6s)]
*  And once in a while, like in Moderna, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=710.76s)]
*  we will create a pharma company. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=712.36s)]
*  But other times, we could create a lot of return on that early risk [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=714.28s)]
*  if we can forge these alliances. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=718.28s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying this is a panacea. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=720.0s)]
*  It's a lot of hard work and people's, you know, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=721.92s)]
*  an incumbent can shift directions quickly depending [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=724.68s)]
*  on what the company is. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=727.56s)]
*  And if you're a supplier to that incumbent and all [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=728.86s)]
*  of a sudden what you're working on is irrelevant, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=730.8s)]
*  that's a dangerous place to be. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=732.74s)]
*  So you can't rely, over rely on this. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=734.3s)]
*  Capital markets and these kind of partnerships end [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=736.58s)]
*  up balancing each other. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=740.12s)]
*  You mentioned in the beginning of our discussion, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=741.4200000000001s)]
*  it's been a tough capital environment for many startups, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  let alone in life sciences where the time horizons are long. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what other antidote there is to that other [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=750.0s)]
*  than finding capital and support in complementary sources [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  so that you have the two things to rely on [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=757.2800000000001s)]
*  and not just how capital markets feel about your industry. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, you've had a number of successes in Moderna [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  as we've discussed. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=764.76s)]
*  But there have been some failures as well. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=766.0600000000001s)]
*  We've had recently Excella Health and Evalo Therapeutics, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=767.8s)]
*  just for instance, you know, shuttered. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=771.08s)]
*  So what lessons do you learn from the failures? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=773.0s)]
*  I mean, we learn most of the lessons through failures. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=776.84s)]
*  But you have to understand for us, and again, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=779.62s)]
*  I've been doing this for 35, 36 years. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think I would have done it [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=784.0s)]
*  unless I viewed things this way. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=785.28s)]
*  So I'll tell you how I make peace with that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=786.54s)]
*  I view breakthroughs as an emergent thing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=789.74s)]
*  I don't view them as being made by people. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=793.4s)]
*  I view them as being emergent. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=795.16s)]
*  So what does emergence means? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=797.9599999999999s)]
*  The thing we know most about emergence is evolution. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=798.92s)]
*  So Darwinian evolution, natural selection, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  applied to variation, that's an emergent process. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=803.92s)]
*  And so what I mean by that is that I view what we do [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  as create a lot of variation, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=810.24s)]
*  apply a lot of selection pressure, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=812.0s)]
*  and then iterate, iterate, iterate, iterate. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=813.76s)]
*  Eventually on the resource constraints, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=816.0s)]
*  some of those things will fail. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=817.92s)]
*  Some of these species will die out. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=819.24s)]
*  And you can learn a lot along the way. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=821.24s)]
*  But if you're not willing to suffer those failures [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  and actually run the experiments, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=825.8s)]
*  you cannot have the successes. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=828.0s)]
*  So to me, a successful species is the descendant [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=829.3599999999999s)]
*  of a whole lot of species that went extinct [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=832.88s)]
*  in an indirect way because they were in the same competition. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=835.16s)]
*  And so I very much think that while it's super important [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=838.0s)]
*  to learn from these things, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=841.76s)]
*  you have to realize that if you're not meeting [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  enough failures, you're not gonna have any successes. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=845.3199999999999s)]
*  And so we view it in a fairly objective way. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=848.0s)]
*  Now, how you approach it obviously impacts people [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=849.9799999999999s)]
*  and careers and the like. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=853.4799999999999s)]
*  Given our size and scale, we do our best to make sure [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=855.12s)]
*  that that process is institutionally supported [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=858.52s)]
*  versus an individual startup where if you fail, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=862.24s)]
*  you shut off the lights and that's it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=864.48s)]
*  So we have a long history of being able to help people. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=866.44s)]
*  We, a lot of people in our companies [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=870.28s)]
*  actually get redirected into other companies. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=871.88s)]
*  We have 40 some companies. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=874.16s)]
*  And so I think there's ways to do that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=875.6s)]
*  And I don't wanna kind of dismiss the human impact, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=878.24s)]
*  but that it is a necessary part [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=881.48s)]
*  of creating breakthroughs. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=884.16s)]
*  I don't know how to create breakthroughs otherwise. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=885.4s)]
*  So the Neanderthals and the humans, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  they continue to have a relationship for a bit [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=889.24s)]
*  until the humans can benefit in the long run. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=891.88s)]
*  And then people will sequence the humans [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  and find a lot of Neanderthals. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=896.64s)]
*  A lot of Neanderthal, yep. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=897.8s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=899.0799999999999s)]
*  So one area that's attracted a lot of attention [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=901.6s)]
*  and money is longevity. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=904.36s)]
*  And that's a broad category that means not just, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=906.16s)]
*  I think to people expanding the lifespan, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  but what people call the health span and wellness. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=911.5s)]
*  What is Flagship's ambition in that space? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=914.9s)]
*  We have for the last few years been working [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=917.42s)]
*  on what we call preemptive health and medicine. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=920.06s)]
*  This precedes the pandemic, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=922.46s)]
*  although the pandemic kind of took over this topic. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=923.6999999999999s)]
*  And that is, can we, with just observation [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=926.3s)]
*  that many now have made, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=929.1s)]
*  that what we call healthcare as a euphemism, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=931.62s)]
*  it's actually sick care. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=934.42s)]
*  And you know it pretty easily [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=935.78s)]
*  because you have to get sick to get any of it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=937.8199999999999s)]
*  And so very little of healthcare [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=939.78s)]
*  is dispensed before you're sick. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=941.06s)]
*  And the question is, if you start it over again [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=942.98s)]
*  and you actually want to dispense healthcare, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=944.3000000000001s)]
*  what would that look like? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  And we think about prevention. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=947.62s)]
*  So clearly we have vaccines to do prevention. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=949.1s)]
*  But the more we've learned about disease, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=951.4200000000001s)]
*  the more I think we can find traces [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=953.5s)]
*  of the early phases of disease [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=956.0600000000001s)]
*  that one could easily call pre-disease. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=958.1s)]
*  That's such a thing as pre-diabetes. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=959.9s)]
*  When you get a colonoscopy, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  you're looking for often polyps. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=963.4s)]
*  Is that a cancer? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=965.22s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=966.22s)]
*  Is that a pre-disease of cancer? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=967.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=968.7s)]
*  So you wanna do something about it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=969.58s)]
*  Why don't we as a society spend money [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=971.1s)]
*  actually trying to detect pre-disease in pre-patients [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=973.82s)]
*  and pre-treat it so as to delay the disease? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=976.86s)]
*  That was what we mean by pre-emptive health and medicine. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=979.5400000000001s)]
*  So perhaps health span more than lifespan. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=982.58s)]
*  Health span for sure. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=984.5s)]
*  Health span maximization for sure. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=985.66s)]
*  And I just think, so one interesting statistic. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=987.82s)]
*  In the UK where they trace these things, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=990.5400000000001s)]
*  we looked a couple years ago, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=992.24s)]
*  2.5% of their healthcare cost goes upstream of disease. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=993.9s)]
*  So 2.5 cents in upstream, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  the rest downstream. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1000.08s)]
*  Imagine if our military operated that way. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1001.38s)]
*  So we basically spend 99% of our money in war [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  and 1% to avoid, prevent, delay war. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  We figured that out as a society long time ago. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1011.76s)]
*  And we said, you know what? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1014.08s)]
*  How about we put in 10, 20% and more upstream of that [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
*  and then reserve these really expensive weapons [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1018.44s)]
*  when we really need them. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1021.08s)]
*  That same mindset in health is complicated [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1022.38s)]
*  by our insurance system, our regulatory system, and so on. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1024.5s)]
*  But if I said today, are we really gonna provide healthcare [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1028.84s)]
*  the same way 50 years from now? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1032.08s)]
*  Most people say, no, no, no. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1033.6s)]
*  By then, we'll be able to see very early signs of disease. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1034.52s)]
*  And for example, in cancer, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1037.24s)]
*  where we're working a company called Harbinger we have, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1038.6s)]
*  is not only looking for cancer and circulating blood, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1041.3s)]
*  but we're looking for stage one and stage zero cancer. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1044.0s)]
*  There's no other manifestation, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1046.6799999999998s)]
*  but for the fact that if you wait six months or a year, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1048.4399999999998s)]
*  you'll actually get a diagnosis. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  If we can get to that early stage, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1052.04s)]
*  then pharma companies will be able to try agents [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1054.48s)]
*  of that subset of people. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1056.86s)]
*  I'm very optimistic to your words, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1058.86s)]
*  but I'm also very paranoid [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1060.9399999999998s)]
*  that there's a hell of a lot of things [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1062.34s)]
*  that will get in the way. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1063.74s)]
*  Still, the prize is worth the struggle. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1064.86s)]
*  And I think we're definitely working on that. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1067.8999999999999s)]
*  We've got many companies that are chasing that. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1069.8999999999999s)]
*  So we want to get to the audience questions. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1071.6599999999999s)]
*  And usually I try to give folks a little bit of a warning, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1074.22s)]
*  but we're running low on time. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1076.26s)]
*  So I'm just gonna go straight to the questions. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1077.6s)]
*  If we can bring the lights down, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1079.3s)]
*  there are mics around the room. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  And if people raise their hand, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1083.06s)]
*  I can call on you and get a mic to you. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  This gentleman here on the side, I think you were first. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1088.6s)]
*  And I'll try to be brief. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1094.9599999999998s)]
*  Please introduce yourself. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1096.28s)]
*  Peter Bacronis, Inception Property Group. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  We own, manage, develop healthcare facilities. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1099.3799999999999s)]
*  I like your comment about the innovation supply chain. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1101.9599999999998s)]
*  I'd like to say or ask, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1104.86s)]
*  what is the gap of the human capital supply chain [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1107.1599999999999s)]
*  to serve the innovation supply chain? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1110.76s)]
*  I.e., what are universities and people studying life science, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1113.5s)]
*  what should they be aiming or targeting for [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1117.98s)]
*  to best fulfill that innovation supply chain [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1121.02s)]
*  for Moderna and your competitors? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1125.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1128.58s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of different answers I can give you, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1130.26s)]
*  but in short, I'd say first, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1132.18s)]
*  it's really important for people to realize [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1134.38s)]
*  that when you work in this industry, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1135.94s)]
*  you're basically by definition having social impact [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1137.84s)]
*  in that you're dealing with people's health and their lives. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1141.4s)]
*  It's an extremely rewarding industry to be in [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1143.5600000000002s)]
*  if you are mission-oriented. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1146.0400000000002s)]
*  Second, you wanna give people not only tools [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  for the present way in which it works, but for the future. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1150.74s)]
*  And by definition, that means we believe a heavy emphasis [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1153.72s)]
*  on being able to be familiar [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1157.14s)]
*  and able to use AI approaches across the board. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1159.0400000000002s)]
*  This is an inevitable irreversible trend [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1162.16s)]
*  that's affecting our industry. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1164.5200000000002s)]
*  So, and places like Northeastern University, for example, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1166.5200000000002s)]
*  where they've had a long-standing record [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1169.22s)]
*  of getting students embedded. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1171.22s)]
*  We have tons of, our companies use a lot of these interns. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1172.82s)]
*  So how to get people exposed, infected [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1177.5s)]
*  with the potential of working in this space, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1180.06s)]
*  and then how do you enable them to be able to learn [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1181.78s)]
*  how to grow and how to learn? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1184.06s)]
*  These are all things that I think [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1185.74s)]
*  many great schools are doing today. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1186.8600000000001s)]
*  Do we have other questions? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1189.06s)]
*  It's a little hard for me to see. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1190.94s)]
*  I see a hand up over there in the back. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1192.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1199.74s)]
*  Dr. Agatha Green, thoracic surgery, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1200.94s)]
*  Clion Clinic, Florida. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1203.38s)]
*  You talked about preventing or detecting [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1205.74s)]
*  early stage cancer, number one killer in cancer [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1209.26s)]
*  is lung cancer. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1212.82s)]
*  Do you have any initiatives regarding [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1214.18s)]
*  detecting early pre-cancer relations, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1217.06s)]
*  and like CT scanning and, you know? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1221.3400000000001s)]
*  So our approach there is, there's a company [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1225.16s)]
*  called Harbinger Health, where internally we [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1227.88s)]
*  developed an epigenetic set of markers [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1230.52s)]
*  that unlike our other approaches, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1234.24s)]
*  where these are purely statistically derived [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  by looking at lots of cancer patients, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1238.56s)]
*  in our case, these are biologically derived. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1240.48s)]
*  In other words, these indicate a particular pathway [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1243.04s)]
*  that gets turned on in most cancers, lung cancers included. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1246.64s)]
*  And so we are essentially developing tests [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1249.6000000000001s)]
*  that we could use as a screen for very early stage [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1252.44s)]
*  detection of any number of cancers in circulating blood, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1256.22s)]
*  with the capability to then figure out [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1260.02s)]
*  what the tissue of origin is, which [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1262.26s)]
*  is a different type of test. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1264.3400000000001s)]
*  So the combination of the two, we think, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1265.74s)]
*  will precede CT scans and other approaches, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1267.8200000000002s)]
*  because you might say, what am I going [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1270.9s)]
*  to do with a stage zero cancer? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1273.02s)]
*  And the other is to essentially carefully watch and use [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1274.46s)]
*  other techniques only on those people [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1277.8600000000001s)]
*  to be able to detect as early as possible [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1279.94s)]
*  a physical manifestation of it. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1282.0s)]
*  So that's our approach. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1283.48s)]
*  I'm sure there's many other ones. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1284.8400000000001s)]
*  We have time for one more question, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1286.24s)]
*  if you promise to be super fast. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1287.88s)]
*  And I see a gentleman here who I think would like to ask one. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1289.3200000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1293.0800000000002s)]
*  And a fast answer. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1294.0s)]
*  I'm Jonathan Smiga, King Growth Capital. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1295.0800000000002s)]
*  We're impact investors in health and wellness. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1297.4s)]
*  When I listen to the things today, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1300.76s)]
*  we had the ozempic piece. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1303.0s)]
*  They made Nova Nordic massive amounts of money. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1304.56s)]
*  Eli Lilly's doubled its market cap. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1307.56s)]
*  In the last couple of years, we listened to the last panel [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1309.78s)]
*  all about treatments. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  And I love what you've been saying about stage zero cancer. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1314.68s)]
*  My wife's a breast cancer survivor in that regard. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1317.6s)]
*  But how do we move the pathways of follow the health [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1321.12s)]
*  or follow the money? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1326.72s)]
*  Seems to be inconsistent motives in the broader health care [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1328.44s)]
*  industry, where there's tons of money [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1332.24s)]
*  to be made for post-cancer treatments, as an example, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1334.28s)]
*  rather than what you're talking about. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1338.22s)]
*  How do we do more genetic testing, cellular mutation [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1339.9s)]
*  testing, things that give us a chance to actually nip it [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1343.54s)]
*  at the bud? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1346.5s)]
*  And we're low on time. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1347.18s)]
*  So we'll have to. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1348.42s)]
*  I don't have a one-word answer for that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1349.74s)]
*  But I would say much of the money, as you know, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1352.3400000000001s)]
*  in health care is spent on things that don't work. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1355.46s)]
*  But it is lost in the kind of system. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1358.5s)]
*  And then new things often will get a lot of scrutiny, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1361.8600000000001s)]
*  because people try to recover some value for what they've [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1364.6200000000001s)]
*  put in and the risk they've taken. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1367.94s)]
*  And I just think that the innovators [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1369.64s)]
*  have to do a much better job of describing the impact they're [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  having, the cost justification for what they're charging. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1374.2s)]
*  And the rest of the industry has to be [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1377.24s)]
*  able to explain why so much waste happens, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1379.44s)]
*  and so much of the money is lost in intermediaries. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1381.92s)]
*  So I don't have a good fix to that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1385.2s)]
*  But I do think that it is a political issue, just as much [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1387.28s)]
*  as it's an economic or scientific issue. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegQUrcsJaY&t=1390.3600000000001s)]
