# Bumble Executives on AI in Dating Apps, Online Relationships and More | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk)
*  So I want to take this back a little bit since you handed the CEO torch over to Lidiani and of course you're still founder and executive chair now Whitney. How did you two meet? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=0.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=10.0s)]
*  I wish I had been on Bumble. But it was similar because actually. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=12.0s)]
*  It had been a long search. I knew I was ready to take this next step and it had been a decade of being nearly a decade of being the CEO. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=18.0s)]
*  And I saw Lidiani online. I watched an interview on CNBC and I just said I need to meet this woman. She is brilliant. She feels like the perfect balance to my skill sets and the things I'm not excellent at. She seems to be brilliant at. I need to find her. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=28.0s)]
*  And so I went back to the recruiters and they're like oh that's impossible. That's a no go. That's a hard no. And I said OK well then I have to go through my network. We had one mutual connection. I said can you please beg this woman to just speak with me for 20 minutes. That's it. I just want 20 minutes of her time. And she graciously agreed to get on the call. She was a customer you know so it's a little tricky. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=50.0s)]
*  You felt obligated. Yeah. So I'm glad it worked out. It was great. I love that. Well you know there have been a lot of founder to new CEO transitions that we've seen over the years that can get complicated. You know we've seen Howard Schultz with Starbucks doing a little backseat driving lately. The Disney debacle with the two Bobs. How is it going to be different. And how is it going to go right with you two. Well you know I think first of all it is different for women I think. You know for me. I think it's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=74.0s)]
*  an honor to be entrusted by a founder that I deeply admire. But it's really important that Whitney is successful too and that we keep the soul of what she's built at the company. So it's a very different dynamic. And I was telling Emily backstage that it's been incredibly supportive. You know it's very interesting when you're deciding to take on a job especially from a founder. The founders will always say like of course I'll give you all the space. But you know it's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=104.0s)]
*  but it's been the case for sure. Whitney not only is just a great resource an incredible soul of this company but also it's just giving me a ton of space. It's been phenomenal. And I can't I can't say enough good things about how gracious you've been. Well and just to add on to that. Thank you for those really kind words. We're in this together and we're not here out of ego. We are not building upon the last decade and letting on the ushering in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=134.0s)]
*  next decade for anything other than the genuine intention of pushing this mission forward. This was never meant to be a company without soul. Everything we've done has had the intention of really pushing women forward giving them agency over their relationships over their choices. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=164.0s)]
*  That is the you know that's the founding principle but that is so much of the heart and soul of Lydiany as well. And so we are doing this to really have a positive impact on the world. And we're pretty competitive. So I think we're going to build the biggest business maybe ever run run and founded by women. I think that's our goal. But we work together not against each other. And that's that's really exciting. I want to pick up on you mentioned of course Bumble at its core is about women and at its core it's about women making the first move. That's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=185.0s)]
*  the apri launch recently. And now it's about doing that a little bit differently. So Lydiany can you tell us a little bit about this apri launch. Yeah you know just to emphasize what when you just said I came to Bumble because of its mission because I believe there's still a lot of room in the world for women to be empowered for women to take charge and make the first move has been the foundation of that. I think Whitney has made the first move herself in so many ways as a great role model for her for women everywhere. And it was important [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=215.0s)]
*  for both of us that at this next stage of the company that making the first move gave women autonomy and an agency and how they do that. So we are still making the first move. Women still make the first move to Bumble. But now they get to control how they do that. And when I continue to focus are next to the next several years it's all about putting the control on women's hands even more so in everything that we do. So we're really excited about this evolution. It's been [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=245.0s)]
*  you know really rewarding to get our customers feedback as we navigate this. How did Gen Z's preferences fit into this. None of us are Gen Z on this stage in case anyone was wondering. So how do you how do you market to them and how do you bring them into that the app and kind of bridge those online connections and then take it to IRL after. Well she's now our expert. So well you know Bumble has always been a platform that you meet online so we can get offline. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=275.0s)]
*  And that is still the principle of how we think about the work that we do. And that's more important for younger users than ever. For you know young people in general there is just a great need for connection for real human you know friendships and love. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=305.0s)]
*  And that's become even more important in this post pandemic era. So our goal is to help people find real human safe healthy kind connections. We are going to continue to focus a lot of our efforts around that. And we announced yesterday that we are acquiring a company called Geneva. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=323.6s)]
*  That's really focused around making connections and communities. And again it's all about meeting in real life. So we're really thrilled to take more and more steps towards helping younger people find find real connections in their lives. You know Whitney you've talked about the loneliness epidemic. And I think you know taking off of what you said Lidiani where you know we're all here right now. But I think at many points in different people's lives no matter who you're surrounded with or how busy you might be you might still feel lonely. And I'm just curious Whitney if you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=343.96s)]
*  could tell us a little bit more about what you think about that term and how Bumble fits into it as well. Yeah. So I I really think we have all been a bit disconnected largely due to technology. And so we've taken a different approach where we've said how can we build something that to Lidiani's point starts online but then really has the genuine intention of getting us offline. And so I think this is going to be so critical in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=373.96s)]
*  era of A.I. as well which we'll talk about. But it is not to drive us further apart. It is not to replace humans with artificial intelligence or a chat bot. This is really all centered around trying to help us reconnect with other people and find our community because loneliness. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=403.96s)]
*  You know loneliness. It was it's only going to get worse if we stay in our phones and we stay disconnected. So really we do run a tech business with with a lot of intention behind getting you offline into the real world and looking each other in the eyes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=426.64s)]
*  There's no replacement for this. You can watch from the webinar and that's great. But us making eye contact and just seeing each other there's no there's just nothing better than being you know really engaged with someone in the real world. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=442.88s)]
*  The here and now. So I do want to talk about A.I. though because you did mention that. And I think first we'll start with some comments that you made recently just around potential dating concierges and how one could connect to another and maybe they could filter out our dating world for us in the future. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=457.16s)]
*  Is that something that Bumble has brainstormed about. I mean there's so much potential with A.I. So just to clarify and for the record I've never seen Black Mirror. I got a lot of comments that this sounds like a black mirror episode. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=475.16s)]
*  I need to go watch it but I do think that some context is important here. Nothing we ever do. And I'll let Liddy on you speak to this will be. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=487.36s)]
*  In an effort to replace human connection. So my comments around potentially an A.I. agent coach concierge of sorts which is not obscure many many. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=498.48s)]
*  I mean it sounded kind of great. It is. It does sound great. So the reason why it's great is that the baseline of it is hyper compatibility. I think what has bothered people stress people out about this modern era of love is that people feel that they're putting themselves out there and they're forced to swipe through so many different profiles and engage with so many different people to maybe not even find something that's compatible. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=512.2s)]
*  And so our efforts and I'll and I'll turn it to you here shortly. Our efforts are really about hyper compatibility. How do we get to know you in a way that is authentic to you. And how do we help you really find what you're looking for. We save you time. We save you energy. We make it safer more compatible more desirable and always through the lens of Bumble's values. So how do we make sure that this is not a disempowering experience but something that can [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=542.2s)]
*  supercharge your quest to community love friendship. We just you know announced Geneva. This is an ecosystem of human connections and using technology as a bridge to build healthier and more equitable relationships. And that's really ultimately what was you know at the base of that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=572.2s)]
*  I want to turn it to let it out and also keep talking about a.I. your former CEO of Slack. You've worked on a ton of emerging technologies cloud at Salesforce machine learning at Microsoft. I don't need to list your whole resume here but you know a lot about time and is genuinely brilliant. When you're thinking about Bumble and a.I. what are some of the generative a.I. just to be super clear what are some of the tools or additional areas that Bumble is using right now when it comes to a.I. and maybe what are some of the near future options or added benefits that could come from using generative [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=593.28s)]
*  a.I. down the line. Yeah I think one important thing to think about in terms of generative a.I. specifically is that we're transitioning from predictive modeling. You know so recommendations personalizations things that we're all used to already are very predictive. You get you know a system to look at your previous behaviors and determine to the best of its ability what you're going to like. That's what a lot of our compatibility models are built on today. And to Whitney's point with generative a.I. there's a couple of major differences. I'm going to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=623.28s)]
*  oversimplify but the intent is we can input way more information like multimodal based information and it's no longer just predictive predictive still important but not the only thing it is also about inferences. It's able to create reasoning behind all of this data and so with reasoning and a lot more information we can completely transform our compatibility information looks like. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=653.28s)]
*  So there's two big things that we're looking at one is how do we describe ourselves. You know we all project ourselves in the best possible way. I will tell us the best way to describe that sound. You know today it's a little funny if you're trying to go on a date if you're trying to build your profile on Bumble. Usually people ask for a little help from their friend. You know like OK do you think I really like this. Like you kind of want a little bit of validation. So being able to like express yourself in a way that feels more human to you that not only it's OK to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=679.48s)]
*  start with a very optimistic view of ourselves but we can learn with you along the way based on your tone of voice based on the way you're interacting with other people. It's a self learning system about who you are and we're not going to do to witness point. We're not going to do we're not going to make any decisions on your behalf. We want users to always be in control of the system. So but we make you aware that you tend to actually have a better conversation with people that are more this way instead of the way you describe. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=709.48s)]
*  But we're going to help people become better at understanding who they are so that they can connect more confidently. And then because we're going to have more access to more information and feedback loops built in the system of compatibility gets completely transformed. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=739.48s)]
*  And so we really want to emphasize smaller number of matches but ones that truly truly feel great to you and not just from a romantic perspective. We've you know we've just said that incredibly well. It's about connection in different parts of your lives. You know we really think about every moment you know you're new into a city or looking for a new job. You're new to a new job. You're a new mom. Like there's all these phases in life that are extremely vulnerable for people and we think we can play a role in helping [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=757.8s)]
*  you navigate. But again it's all about meeting real people. At the end of the day we succeed if you get out there and you meet a real person and you make a friend or you meet the love of your life. And that's been one of the best things about joining Bumble. It's the piles of letters that we get from people who found love who have their babies or planning their wedding. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=787.8s)]
*  So I was going to say Whitney said back in the day that she used to read like a lot of the reader feedback. Is there anything that stood out to you either of you now like recent feedback that you've gotten of finding love that just stood out that you got excited about. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=807.44s)]
*  This is what we do all day. Other love stories back and forth. The thing that has struck me as as really as something so beautiful and it was my original hope and dream. And just to give everybody here a little background we did announce a acquisition for. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=820.12s)]
*  Geneva which is going to help build friendship and community out further. But we've had Bumble for friends for multiple years. So the original vision of Bumble actually funny enough did not start as a dating app. I wanted to start a company. It was called Marcy at the time where we would treat each other with kindness on the Internet. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to build the kindest place online for people to find community and friends because of the toxic behavior on the Internet. So it's been beautiful to see that original mission take shape first through dating and then really spread through these other communities. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=856.16s)]
*  But the love stories that I've heard to kind of put a pin in it. People will say I got on Bumble. I met my spouse boyfriend husband whatever you want to call it. And then I met my best friends on Bumble for friends and they all became my bridesmaids in my Bumble wedding. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=871.56s)]
*  And so you see this like incredible circle of love. And I mean the stories have been profound. We would need six hours. But I mean we love it. Sounds really validating. And I do want to open it up to questions soon. I just have a few more here. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=889.0s)]
*  First I mean we're talking about a lot of the changes that Bumble's been going through and also how technology can continue changing Bumble. I do want to ask about one which is that there were layoffs earlier this year. A lot of companies the Wall Street [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=901.56s)]
*  Journal's reported on including a lot of tech companies have had layoffs. I was hoping you would just give us a sense of what the workforce looks like and if you expect more layoffs in the future or if you think the company is at a good spot right now. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=911.92s)]
*  Lidiani. Yeah you know one of the key things for us you know first and foremost is going through a layoff is really hard for any organization. And you know given the mission and the set of values that you know Whitney has built at the company it was really important for us to go through it in a way that was respectful to everyone impacted. So I'm really grateful you know for the how the values of the company has now helped us navigate a difficult time these last few months. But our goal was simple is we really want to organize our [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=923.04s)]
*  ourselves to help us accelerate achieving our mission. If we can be faster and higher quality and better responsive you know that more responsive to our customers then we're set up for success. And that was really the foundation of how are we right sizing ourselves to be as innovative and as fast as we can be. And that was the anchor behind that. And you know it's very grateful to have Whitney as a sounding board as we're navigating all of this because I was so new. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=953.04s)]
*  And so she's been just a great great support. It's not always easy as CEO stepping in and then having kind of a layoff announcement and just navigating through that. I do want to open it up to questions in just a moment but I'd be remiss if I just didn't ask about the recent ads. You know not every ad campaign adds perfect [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=983.24s)]
*  lands perfectly. And Whitney in the beginning did a bunch of different things to try to get attention for Bumble. There were recent anti celibacy ads that drew up a little concern around the Internet and elsewhere. Can you guys just explain how that [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1000.0s)]
*  one happened and what you learned from that lesson. Yeah you know the intent really was we support all choices people make all of it really. That's the intent is that women are in control of making whatever choices they they want to make. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1012.92s)]
*  And we just made a mistake in how that landed. It was not good and we felt really terrible about it. It was really important that we responded in a genuine and honest way because the mission of the company is to support women. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1026.68s)]
*  And so we are using this as an opportunity to learn and really focus on how are we going to elevate not only our marketing campaign moving forward but our investments to make our mission shine even more. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1041.6399999999999s)]
*  So this is why I joined this company. It's to this is why you founded this company is to support women. So when it doesn't land well with the core audience we're trying to serve we just got to do much better. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1054.32s)]
*  That's what we're focused on. We were devastated by the way it made our customers feel and we're going to do better next time. You made a mistake. We will learn from it and we will overcome. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1066.5600000000002s)]
*  Own it and move forward. Let's open it up to questions. Do we have any in the audience. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1079.2s)]
*  I see a gentleman in a suit over there and then we can go to a woman a lady in the front and blue after. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1086.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1092.3200000000002s)]
*  So if I understand correctly your hope is to be able to use a I to create a hyper compatibility. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  If the machines get people together they get married they have children it means that the machines will be breeding humans. Do you. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1102.0400000000002s)]
*  Do you. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1111.8000000000002s)]
*  Do you envision what society might look like if everybody was matched by hyper compatibility. Is it going to cause polarization. Do you concern yourself with the end result. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1113.72s)]
*  It's a good question. You know the way that I think about it is how do we facilitate you meeting great people at the end of the day. It's not about. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1125.76s)]
*  Machine controlling the experience. You know I think the point I made earlier about the user is always in control and there's always transparency and what a machine is recommending. Then we were not making decisions for people. I think that's a very important point to be clear about. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1134.4s)]
*  We have always focused on safety and ethical use of AI. I actually believe Bumble can be a really important voice on how AI responsibilities being set because the company has focused so much on safety for the past 10 years. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1152.9199999999998s)]
*  So that is our focus is that people are always in control and our goals that you meet great people at the end of the day and that's going to just differentiate in terms of where humans are. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1169.84s)]
*  I'd like to just make one point. Machines have been connecting people. So the number one way people meet according to various studies is online. So technically speaking this is not a very far out concept of oh no. The phone or the computer is going to be matching us. I mean how many of you in the audience met somebody from your phone or on the Internet. Did anybody hear. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1180.72s)]
*  Whitney did not bring hats. Yeah time when she asked that question. I do have hats. I'm always prepared with my. No but so I want you to just take that in for a moment. It's the next layer of that. It is not. It's not necessarily disruption to how we meet. It's just enhancing it. It's making it more compatible. And so everything Liddy on his side will be intact as we go to this next evolution of love. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1207.24s)]
*  But we're already meeting through the computer through the phone and we have been for a very long time. Good point. Let's squeeze in one last question over here. A short one if you may. Sure. I was just going to say I am one of those people who did meet my husband online and made the first move pre bumble. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1235.4s)]
*  Back in the day. My question is you're in a very cluttered category obviously and everyone's trying to differentiate themselves. You guys have come with a unique angle of women make the first move. How do you continue to differentiate yourself in this category. Is it storytelling. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1249.48s)]
*  How do you continue to kind of lead. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1263.48s)]
*  For us we've talked a bunch about this. It is still going to be about women women's experience is the foundation of what we do. But it is a combination of things you know great innovation great storytelling. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1267.52s)]
*  The one of the things that I think we haven't celebrated enough is the number of success stories that we have. We just ran a campaign for people that want to get married in Vegas. We got hundreds of people telling their stories. We're going to celebrate about 50 couples that are going to get married and we're just so thrilled to get to learn their stories. So I think there is just a lot you know honestly that we we can do that's unique for bumble. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1280.64s)]
*  Yeah and just to close that out the vision for bumble was never just to be another dating app. It was really meant to be a movement for healthy relationships. If you look at the state of relationships and love around the world it is not equal. If you look at how women live in their love lives around the world it is still a disaster. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTL5J4B38Pk&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  And so we have so much runway ahead of us. We have decades of work to do to really use technology and innovation and AI as a component of that to really progress how we love each other and how we treat each other. And I do believe that the vision and mission of bumble is so much bigger than just a dating app. How can we use both innovation thoughtful leadership exceptional CEO to really change how we treat each other both on and off.
