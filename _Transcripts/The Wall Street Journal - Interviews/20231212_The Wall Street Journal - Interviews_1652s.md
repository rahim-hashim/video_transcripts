# Is a Soft Landing in Sight? Janet Yellen's Predictions for the Economy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E)
*  Secretary Yellen, thank you so much for joining us this morning. It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=0.0s)]
*  My pleasure. Thanks so much for the invitation. Let's start with the inflation report that just [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  came out. Inflation has been much better behaved in the second half of the year. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=8.16s)]
*  Headline inflation is down to 3.1 percent in November from 9.1 percent in June of last year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=12.56s)]
*  Core prices rose last month 0.3 percent from October. That's a three and a half percent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=19.2s)]
*  annualized rate. Is inflation vanquished? It's certainly meaningfully coming down [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=24.64s)]
*  and I see no reason on the path that we're currently on why inflation shouldn't gradually [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=31.6s)]
*  decline to levels that are consistent with the fed's mandate and targets. So supply chain [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=39.2s)]
*  issues that resulted from the pandemic and mismatches and disruption in labor markets [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  both seem to be healing. As that happens, inflation's moved down the labor market. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  While it remains very strong, obviously we've had 22 months now with below 4 percent inflation, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  which is quite a phenomenon. I think we haven't seen that in about 50 years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=75.68s)]
*  Still the labor market is cooling some as job openings come down. The intensity of hiring [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=82.4s)]
*  is diminished some, but of course we haven't seen layoffs and we have excellent job creation, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  labor force participation increasing. And at this point with inflation down so much [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  wage increases continuing at a healthy pace, real wages are rising. I believe we saw this morning [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=105.52s)]
*  that real average hourly earnings are up 1.4 percent over the last year. So there's a view [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=113.44s)]
*  among the economics commentariat that I often hear that says the last mile of getting inflation down [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=120.64s)]
*  will be the hardest. What do you think? Could inflation be more persistent if the unemployment [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=126.88s)]
*  rate continues to run below 4 percent and wage growth runs above 4 percent? Well we're seeing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=132.4s)]
*  wage growth, nominal wage growth, gradually diminish and as price pressures decline real [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  wages are rising, but productivity has been pretty healthy and we're not seeing pressure on unit [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=146.08s)]
*  labor costs. I personally don't see any good reason to think that the last mile is going to be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=154.08s)]
*  especially difficult. I think we have an economy that's roughly operating at full employment [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=162.8s)]
*  and it can continue to do so. I think people predicted that unemployment was going to have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=169.36s)]
*  to rise considerably in order to get inflation down, but inflation expectations are an important [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=180.0s)]
*  element in the inflation process and inflation expectations, well recent data suggest they've [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=187.84s)]
*  come down, but I think that they've been well under control and that's important because it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=195.84s)]
*  means that there is no underlying inflation momentum that we would need a softer labor market [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=204.24s)]
*  to manage to bring down. So on that point, over the last couple years the two big worries that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=212.72s)]
*  you hear about from economists are we're going to have a wage price spiral or inflation expectations [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=218.0s)]
*  are going to become unanchored. Do you think policymakers have cut off those tails or those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=224.72s)]
*  no longer things we need to be so worried about? You know policymakers are paid to worry, so we [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=230.0s)]
*  always worry about some things, but that's low on my worried list. I don't see any evidence that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=238.88s)]
*  inflation is becoming green or that we have a wage price spiral. Neither of those things seem to me [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=247.12s)]
*  to be problems that we're dealing with and you know the Fed has done a good job of managing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=254.56s)]
*  policy. You know as I said importantly the labor market is showing signs of less stress, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=261.68s)]
*  so while wage growth is healthy it's come down some and real wages are again rising. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=271.36s)]
*  Well and on the point about expectations being anchored, I mean markets certainly seem to agree [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=277.92s)]
*  bond markets think interest rates are going to be lower next year. Is it plausible to have [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=284.0s)]
*  interest rates coming down when inflation is still above two percent? So the decision of what the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=287.92s)]
*  right monetary policy is is up to the Fed. I'm not going to comment on what they should do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=295.76s)]
*  You know I think they need to carefully watch the economy and make a judgment about what's appropriate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=306.72s)]
*  Of course as inflation comes down other things equal, real interest rates tend to rise which [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=315.68s)]
*  causes a tightening of monetary policy in a sense, so that's one factor that could weigh in a decision [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=323.76s)]
*  that the Fed makes about the path of interest rates. So I want to take a step back and take [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=331.76s)]
*  stock of what we've learned about inflation over the last two years. I know people will be writing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=337.76s)]
*  their PhDs about this years from now but I'm curious to get your preliminary assessment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=341.92s)]
*  What caused inflation to go up so much and why has it fallen seemingly without any serious weakness [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=346.96s)]
*  in the economy so far? So I do think we don't know the answer to this at this point and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=353.44s)]
*  it's appropriate that there be some PhD theses and a lot of research papers on this and there's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=361.76s)]
*  going to be time in the years ahead but just looking at what's happened I think there were [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  very significant supply disturbances that were caused by the pandemic shortages, big shifts in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=376.56s)]
*  the structure of demand that led to sectors like automobiles that were faced with enormous [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=386.64s)]
*  excess demand, shortages of chips, shipping, huge increase in shipping costs from Asia. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  So these supply disruptions have gradually come down and you know well I can't say exactly how [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=406.8s)]
*  much that's contributed to lower inflation. I think that's been a factor. You also had enormous [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=416.16s)]
*  disruption in the labor market with you know a very significant number of people laid off or [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  losing their jobs who need to find new work and I think that led to disruptions in the labor market. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=434.0s)]
*  They're also gradually healing in a way the natural rate of unemployment I believe is coming [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=444.16s)]
*  down as people settle into new jobs. I mean that's a very disruptive process. We saw [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=451.12s)]
*  not only desperation on the part of firms as the economy picked up and they were desperately trying [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=458.32000000000005s)]
*  to add to their workforce but mismatch of workers and firms that led people to quit their jobs, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=465.92s)]
*  look for other works until they settled into a good match. So quits were unusually high, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=475.44s)]
*  job openings were very high, wage increases were very high as the labor market you know had been so [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=483.6s)]
*  disrupted but now if you look at it job openings are down substantially. I don't mean by that to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=492.56s)]
*  levels that are worrisome low but to normal good labor market pre-pandemic levels. The quit rate [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=499.44s)]
*  which is I think a driver of wage increases firms tend to rate bid up wages. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=511.28s)]
*  Workers quit their jobs when they think they can get a better price somewhere else. Absolutely and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=519.28s)]
*  you're seeing quit rates come down again toward normal levels so the labor market's normalizing [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=524.72s)]
*  and labor force participation has moved up certainly among adults. We've seen it move up [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  to the highest levels in decades and that's helping to ease inflationary pressures as well. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=539.28s)]
*  So you've said you see a soft landing as the most likely outcome for the economy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=546.8s)]
*  Do I have that right? Yes in the sense that to me a soft landing is the economy continues to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=551.92s)]
*  grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation comes down and I believe that's the path we're on. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=560.56s)]
*  Because when I look back over history soft landings are quite rare. In 2000 and 2007 there was a lot [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=567.52s)]
*  of optimism that the economy was slowing into a soft landing. Most recessions looked like soft [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=572.96s)]
*  landings for a little while. What gives you confidence that this might be more like the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=578.4000000000001s)]
*  episode in the mid 1990s than in the last two downturns absent the COVID shock where it looked [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  like we were soft landing and then we had a hard landing? Well I agree with you that it is an [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=589.2s)]
*  unusual thing to have happen and it certainly takes skill on the part of the Fed to calibrate [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=594.24s)]
*  monetary policy properly. But if you just look at the data it looks as though that's the path we're [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=603.28s)]
*  on and I will say that for the last several years what I've been saying when asked about the economy [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=613.12s)]
*  is that I believe it's possible to have a soft landing. That there's nothing inherent about [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=620.48s)]
*  the shocks that have hit the economy that make it necessary to have a period of high unemployment [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=627.6s)]
*  to get inflation down. So many economists were saying there's no way for inflation to get back [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=636.24s)]
*  to normal without it's entailing a period of high unemployment, a recession. And a year ago [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=642.88s)]
*  I think many economists were saying a recession was inevitable. But actually I've never felt [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=650.4s)]
*  there was a solid intellectual basis for making such a prediction because as long as inflation, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=657.92s)]
*  I mean the times when you've in the United States in a sense needed a downturn to get [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=666.32s)]
*  inflation down, those were periods like after the oil shocks of the 70s when inflation expectations [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  were clearly had moved much higher and inflation then becomes self-perpetuating. You have a wage [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  price spiral that really the only way to bring inflation down is getting inflation expectations [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=690.08s)]
*  down and that involves a period of high unemployment that pushes inflation down and shows people [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=697.84s)]
*  you were wrong, inflation's actually lower than you thought. That's a painful process. We didn't [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  need that and because inflation expectations had never meaningfully ratcheted up on a long-term [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=713.6s)]
*  basis we just had to have the economy normalize and get the labor market back to a sort of full [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=721.44s)]
*  employment state to bring inflation down. Now of course there were shocks along the way, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=728.96s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to soaring food and energy prices that had that of course [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=735.28s)]
*  boosted inflation and had the potential to dislodge inflation expectations. So there have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=744.4s)]
*  been many risks along the way but we've managed to avoid the adverse real consequences of those [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  risks and I think we're in a soft landing path which is highly desirable of course. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=760.72s)]
*  So I don't have to tell you this but there's a disconnect right now. You see some of the surveys, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=767.28s)]
*  people say they're very unhappy with the economy, they feel worse off than three years ago but you [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=771.36s)]
*  look at these kind of headline numbers and you say well what's not to like about low unemployment [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=775.76s)]
*  and inflation coming down. Why do you think there is this disconnect and are you concerned about the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=780.24s)]
*  fact that the administration's message around Bidenomics isn't landing? So I think we've been [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=784.96s)]
*  through a lot. Everybody's, the pandemic caused an enormous amount of disruption in people's lives [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=793.52s)]
*  and we're still in the aftermath of what's been a serious shock and we've had serious global shocks [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=801.12s)]
*  and although prices are rising at a much slower pace than they were, inflation is substantially [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=810.8s)]
*  off its highs. The level of prices of some things that people buy and are important to them are [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=819.52s)]
*  higher. A good example would be rents. Rents have gone up considerably and the cost of if you're in [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=828.0s)]
*  the market to buy a new home at this point with mortgage rates and house prices having increased [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=837.52s)]
*  and I think a lot of young people who are in the market want to start families, are renting, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=844.64s)]
*  want to buy a house, even is and well and we see shelter costs continue to rise. Now the prices of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=850.88s)]
*  new rentals have stabilized and that means that over time shelter inflation will come down, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=862.0s)]
*  bringing in headline inflation and core down as well but people are seeing increases in rental [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=869.84s)]
*  costs and that's an important aspect of their cost of living but you know the Biden administration [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=877.84s)]
*  is doing all that it can and taking steps I think are very meaningful to lower costs [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=887.84s)]
*  in areas where they can. An example would be capping insulin prices for seniors at [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=895.52s)]
*  $35. We now have prescription drug prices coming down, the whole energy, the Inflation Reduction [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=902.64s)]
*  Act, the energy initiatives in that and the bipartisan infrastructure law will bring energy [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=914.64s)]
*  prices down over time and so the Biden administration certainly understands that high prices even if [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=922.0s)]
*  they're no longer rising are definitely a concern to Americans and we're trying to take the steps [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=929.84s)]
*  we can to address these prices. You mentioned mortgage rates. It's been an interesting period [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=937.84s)]
*  in the U.S. Treasury market. We saw a big sell-off in October, rates on the 10-year note up to 5% [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=943.52s)]
*  now they're back to maybe four and a quarter percent. How much of the stability in bond [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=949.12s)]
*  markets since November do you attribute to the Treasury's decision to issue fewer [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=952.96s)]
*  long-term securities than the market expected and was that a deviation from the Treasury's [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=957.84s)]
*  protocol of regular and predictable issuance? So regular and predictable issuance is the core [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=963.36s)]
*  strategy the Treasury follows. Experience shows that regular and predictable issuance is [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=970.96s)]
*  central to keeping borrowing costs contained over time. We routinely confer with market participants [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=981.6s)]
*  to understand changes in the market, shifts in demands for different [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=993.2s)]
*  maturities of securities and our borrowing needs of course shift and really the adjustment that was [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1000.72s)]
*  made I guess it was in November was really quite marginal. We've been increasing our issuance [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1011.44s)]
*  in order to finance deficits and we made a marginal adjustment to increase issuance a bit [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1018.88s)]
*  less at the long end given the strains we saw there but really regular and predictable. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1028.56s)]
*  We do not as a routine matter respond to movements in market rates. Well so if tax receipts were to [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1039.28s)]
*  come in below forecasts and you're forced to issue more would you keep issuance lighter on the long [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1047.52s)]
*  end of the curve in the future given concerns about demand for duration? I'm not sure. I don't [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1052.08s)]
*  know decision about that's been made but we do get the advice of market participants and [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1059.12s)]
*  are trying to understand what's best. More broadly is the long-term fiscal picture for the U.S. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1068.4s)]
*  sustainable particularly if the average interest rate on the public debt is higher [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1074.16s)]
*  in the coming years and we don't go back to the very low interest rates that prevailed [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1078.88s)]
*  before the pandemic. Well one way I judge sustainability of our fiscal path is by [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1083.0400000000002s)]
*  looking at the net real interest costs on the debt which is our financing costs in real or [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1090.64s)]
*  inflation adjusted terms and that has been quite moderate and well within historical norms [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1099.92s)]
*  projected as over time to rise somewhat but still in our sort of last budget toward [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1110.72s)]
*  levels that are not worrisome but if higher interest rates, if interest rates are substantially higher [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1120.72s)]
*  on a long-term basis than we previously projected of course that results in some extra [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1129.36s)]
*  stress on the fiscal outlook. The president has recognized that it's necessary to [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  take steps to reduce the deficit over time to have a more fiscally sustainable policy and he's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1148.08s)]
*  proposed in his last budget two and a half trillion dollars of deficit reduction. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1157.84s)]
*  A lot of this comes about through tax rates that are higher on corporations and wealthy individuals [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  are tax collections as a consequence of the job cuts and tax act in 2017 who fall into historically [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1177.6s)]
*  low levels. Taxes a share of GDP are now at 16 and a half percent so that's about a point and a half [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1187.6s)]
*  percent of GDP below projections before the act was passed and the president has proposed a [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1201.52s)]
*  large number of ways to make up that gap. In addition we have in the United States an utterly [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1214.0s)]
*  enormous tax gap and there I'm referring to the difference between the taxes that are actually [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1221.52s)]
*  collected and the taxes that are due under our existing tax code and that's ranges the estimate [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1228.64s)]
*  over a decade is seven trillion dollars. Congress allocated 80 billion dollars in the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1238.32s)]
*  inflation reduction act to restore the capacity of the internal revenue service to hire the kinds [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1247.84s)]
*  of personnel, tax lawyers, accountants who are able to enforce the tax code and that is going to have [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1255.6s)]
*  a substantial payoff over time. The Republicans recently proposed and we did agree to 20 billion [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1266.64s)]
*  take 20 billion of that back that's no economy at all that's a totally false economy because taking [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1277.44s)]
*  money away from the internal revenue service and CBO has shown this in their estimates it doesn't [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1285.0400000000002s)]
*  reduce the deficit it raises the deficit because this money goes to close that tax gap it makes a [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1292.32s)]
*  considerable difference so we have opportunities on the revenue side I think that needs to be [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1301.6s)]
*  part of any plan and of course with an aging society we do have greater spending we have to [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1308.24s)]
*  foresee on Medicare and Social Security that may need to be addressed. Before we close I want to [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1317.52s)]
*  ask you you were in the APEC meetings in San Francisco last month in the meeting with the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1324.72s)]
*  Chinese leader Xi Jinping what should be the goal of U.S. engagement with China given so much of [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1329.6s)]
*  the frustration and maybe disappointment over the last 20 years is the U.S. doing enough to de-risk [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1335.2s)]
*  from China in your view and is there a danger of doing too much de-risking? So I see a three-part [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1340.72s)]
*  agenda with respect to China the first is that we want to have a relationship that involves [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1348.56s)]
*  healthy competition trade investment that is broadly beneficial both to the United States [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  and to China is good for businesses China is a huge market and is good for American workers creates [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1364.56s)]
*  jobs so we do not want to decouple the Biden administration does not seek to decouple from [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1373.84s)]
*  China but we do seek to de-risk and that means we don't want to be overly dependent when it comes to [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1380.96s)]
*  key supply chains on China instead I've promoted it an approach called French shoring which involves [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1389.12s)]
*  diversifying our supply chains and we're working with India, Vietnam, with Mexico, with Indonesia, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1399.76s)]
*  with other countries to you know continue to get the benefits of international trade but to be [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1408.32s)]
*  less reliant on China we also need a level playing field and the president in his meeting [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1416.56s)]
*  with Xi and I met a few days before that with my Chinese counterpart China has practices that [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1423.44s)]
*  you know result in unfair trade subsidies intellectual property practices that create [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1433.52s)]
*  an unlevel playing field that we intend to address but no decoupling and continued engagement that's [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1442.08s)]
*  plank one plank two we're going to protect our national security and speak out about human rights [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1451.6s)]
*  and there's no compromising about that but we'll try to make our approach as narrow as targeted as [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1459.92s)]
*  we possibly can and I'd say the recent rules that we put forward with respect to outbound investment [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1467.68s)]
*  where we do see some dangers of U.S. firms investing in China are very narrowly targeted [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1478.5600000000002s)]
*  at advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and with real national security [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1486.24s)]
*  implications and the third plank of the China policy is we need to cooperate to address global [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1496.96s)]
*  challenges we have a responsibility to the world to do that. Two areas that are very important are [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  climate change and debt that there are a lot of countries around the world are really suffering [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1512.32s)]
*  especially with high interest rates from unsustainable debt burdens they need to [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1520.16s)]
*  restructure their debt and we need to cooperate to do it and China is one of the biggest lenders lenders [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1525.76s)]
*  so we need to work this isn't a U.S. China issue it's a multilateral issue but we are in regular [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1534.24s)]
*  conversations with our Chinese counterparts to try to make progress in these areas and I feel [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1543.36s)]
*  encouraged by the signs that things are getting better. Thank you for that we're nearly out of time [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1550.8s)]
*  maybe a quick lightning round here you're just one of you're one of just two people who have been [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1558.32s)]
*  chair of the Fed and treasury secretary what are the biggest differences between those two jobs? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1562.7199999999998s)]
*  The Fed's job is very focused mainly on well supervision of course is an important piece [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1568.48s)]
*  of the Fed's job but with respect to the economy it's focusing on constructing a monetary policy [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1577.28s)]
*  that best allows attainment of a price stability maximum employment mandate. The treasury's jobs [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1585.6s)]
*  are very very broad I've never been in a position where the responsibilities are so diverse [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1597.1200000000001s)]
*  we have a thousand people who work at treasury who deal with sanctions and threats to from [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1607.2s)]
*  terrorist financing illicit finance we have tax policy international economic relations [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1614.72s)]
*  with a variety of countries represent the United States in the multilateral development banks [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1625.52s)]
*  and the IMF and on and on so the range of responsibilities at treasury is is really [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1632.48s)]
*  enormous. Which job is better? They're both they're both great I'm a lucky person to have had either of [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1640.72s)]
*  them. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9O0D64V_E&t=1648.4s)]
