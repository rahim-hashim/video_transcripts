# NATO Military Chief on How Countries Can Prepare for War, a Second Trump Presidency and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ)
*  We're going to get started today by talking about war, but not in a way that most people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=0.0s)]
*  think about war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=6.12s)]
*  But first, I want to explain a little bit about what Admiral Bauer does and why he's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=9.88s)]
*  here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=14.32s)]
*  Admiral Bauer, you are an admiral in the Royal Netherlands Navy, but within NATO you are [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=15.32s)]
*  the chair of the military committee, and the military committee is the military representatives [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=20.48s)]
*  of all 32 NATO members. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=25.64s)]
*  I believe it was actually the first body organized when NATO was created. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=28.68s)]
*  You don't lead troops in the field, but you are maybe herding cats within a room of military [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=34.44s)]
*  leaders, and the military committee acts as the interface between the men and women in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=40.6s)]
*  uniform in the NATO members and the political leadership of NATO. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=47.28s)]
*  You are the top military advisor to the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=53.0s)]
*  With that all clear, I noticed today is Victory Day in Moscow. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=58.88s)]
*  There is the war going on in Ukraine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=65.44s)]
*  NATO is on the sidelines, but very much involved. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=67.56s)]
*  What lessons are we learning from the war? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  A number of lessons, I would say. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=78.0s)]
*  For a long time in our part of the world we thought everything was planable, predictable, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=80.28s)]
*  controllable, and that was basically seen in many, many things. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  We were focusing on efficiency for more than 30 years, both in business as well as in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  governments, and efficiency in the business is just in time, just enough. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=98.28s)]
*  We know that in two sectors that wasn't enough. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  It's too late and it's too little, and that is the healthcare sector during COVID and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=107.44s)]
*  in a war for the military sector. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=112.24s)]
*  We're unable to actually respond to peak demand signals. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=115.72s)]
*  I think that is a serious problem we are facing now for the last two years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=122.4s)]
*  That is one of the lessons that we have to learn, that we are able to respond to peak [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=128.68s)]
*  demand signals, especially in the military, but also in the healthcare sector, I would say. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=133.6s)]
*  So that is one. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=139.52s)]
*  That requires a different relationship between the governments and the private sector, which [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=140.84s)]
*  is a difficult subject, but it requires both sides to change and to better understand each [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=147.08s)]
*  other and move towards each other. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=153.08s)]
*  It means that the governments need to become more business-like in their thinking, but [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=156.16s)]
*  it also means that the private sector has to become part of the values discussion and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=161.88s)]
*  not just think about money. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=167.48s)]
*  So that is one lesson. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=170.0s)]
*  The second lesson is that everybody thought the next war will be about cyber and AI and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=171.32s)]
*  quantum and all the sort of high-tech sexy things that people like, and the mud and blood [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=177.24s)]
*  is over. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=183.56s)]
*  And it's not true. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=186.52s)]
*  We see a combination of the two. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  We see that it is World War I back in the 21st century. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=191.4s)]
*  We see trenches, we see mud, we see a lot of blood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=198.4s)]
*  There's more than 500,000 soldiers killed and wounded on both sides combined, which [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=201.96s)]
*  is enormous if you would translate that into our societies, those numbers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=207.44s)]
*  And the debate we would have is probably more difficult than many of the debates that I [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=214.36s)]
*  hear in politics now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=221.44s)]
*  So that type of war is not gone, it is back. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=223.76s)]
*  It is there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=228.72s)]
*  And of course, there is high-tech, there's new things like drones, it's not new per se, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=229.72s)]
*  but the way drones are used and the scale and the mass with which drones are used. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  And then of course, AI and all the things that are, that is about innovation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=240.76s)]
*  So it is the combination of those two things. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=246.0s)]
*  The third lesson that we have to learn is that not everything that happens in Ukraine [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=249.2s)]
*  can be translated into NATO. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=255.16s)]
*  First and foremost, NATO has a very powerful air force combined, which the Ukrainians do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=258.44s)]
*  not have. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=264.7s)]
*  So some of the lessons cannot be translated, because basically the war in Ukraine is a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=266.32s)]
*  very typical classical land war at the moment. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=272.4s)]
*  Technology is not really involved and air is not really involved. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=277.22s)]
*  We would fight a different war with all domains, not only air, maritime and land, but also [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=281.44000000000005s)]
*  space and also cyber. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=288.1s)]
*  And also with regard to cyber, everybody thought cyber is this thing, but cyber has not been [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=290.72s)]
*  as decisive as a lot of people expected it to be. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  It is a nuisance, it's a problem, it's something you have to understand and be able to control [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=299.54s)]
*  and respond to a problem. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=304.54s)]
*  And the private sector has been extremely important for Ukraine when it came to cyber. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=307.18s)]
*  So in the first couple of days, there was a huge cyber attack on the government, especially [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  they stored their data basically locally. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  And now Microsoft has helped them to store it in the cloud. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=322.22s)]
*  That's not in the air, but it's still on the ground. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=326.38s)]
*  So they have dispersed their data, and I think that is a lesson for a lot of governments, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=330.82s)]
*  but also for private sector, I would say, make sure your data is not in one place, but [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=335.02s)]
*  make sure it's in multiple places so you're much less vulnerable. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=339.86s)]
*  And then for a long time when it comes to politics, we thought if you have a mutual [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=346.74s)]
*  economic relationship between nations, we will never have war again. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=352.38s)]
*  Well that has been proven wrong. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=357.82s)]
*  We thought we had a contract with Gazprom. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=360.18s)]
*  We thought we bought our oil and gas from a company, but that wasn't true. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=363.18s)]
*  When Putin said to Gazprom, close the valve, they did it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not in that contract. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=373.62s)]
*  So that is a serious thing we have to live with, and so it was used as a weapon, energy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  as a weapon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  And the wake-up call, I think, for all of us, including the private sector, is that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=384.85999999999996s)]
*  this is happening with Russia, but be ready, this is going to happen with China in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=389.62s)]
*  next five to ten years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=394.94s)]
*  China owns 75% of all the raw materials for the medicine world, for the healthcare, for [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=396.94s)]
*  the production of medicine, and they own 95% of all the raw materials for the renewable [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=403.54s)]
*  energy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=410.94s)]
*  So everybody wants to get rid of gas and oil, fossil fuel, and that's in itself great, that's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=411.66s)]
*  for the climate, very important. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=416.7s)]
*  Everybody wants nuclear energy, so we all want air, we all want wind and solar energy, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=418.98s)]
*  which is great, but most of the raw materials are owned by China. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=426.66s)]
*  And if China, if Xi is going to do this, what Putin has done in five to ten years, we have [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=432.3s)]
*  a serious problem. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=438.38s)]
*  And therefore, we have to become much more resilient. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=439.98s)]
*  That's not only a problem for the government, it's also a problem for the private sector. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  I think we're going to be hearing from a lithium miner later so we can pick up on that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=447.54s)]
*  I found the IKEA CEO yesterday, where are you? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=451.54s)]
*  Are you still here? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=455.54s)]
*  No. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=456.54s)]
*  He had to get back to... [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=457.54s)]
*  Yeah, he has to walk around the store, which is great, and look at the billy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=459.54s)]
*  But no, so he said 25% of his raw material came from Russia, and he had to change that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=466.54s)]
*  overnight basically. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=473.74s)]
*  So that is the sort of thing, and we can talk a little bit about what I think businesses [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=474.54s)]
*  should think about. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=478.54s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=479.54s)]
*  What does this mean, the resilience, readiness, broader thinking? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=481.54s)]
*  So it's not only the military that has to prepare, or the governments that have to prepare [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=485.54s)]
*  for war, but I think the businesses have to prepare for war as well. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=489.54s)]
*  And it is the dependencies I talked about, the raw materials. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=494.54s)]
*  There's the IKEA example we heard yesterday. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=499.54s)]
*  BMW had all their cables produced in Ukraine, two factories, because of great quality of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=503.54s)]
*  workers, and those factories were gone in the first two weeks of the war. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=512.54s)]
*  And so BMW didn't have any cables anymore. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=518.54s)]
*  And that is the sort of thing in terms of if you go to the countries where labor is cheapest [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=522.54s)]
*  or certain expertise is the best, or whatever the arguments are to go somewhere, then that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=528.54s)]
*  is fine and understandable, but we have to become much more strategic. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=533.54s)]
*  And for toilet paper, I don't care where it's made, but for certain things, I think we have [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=538.54s)]
*  to consider bringing back production to Europe, to North America, to make sure that in our, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=543.54s)]
*  let's say, alliance territory, we are able to produce certain things that are essential [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=551.54s)]
*  for our security, for our economy, and that debate means that certain products will become [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=557.54s)]
*  more expensive. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=565.54s)]
*  So we have to explain that to our consumers, our citizens, and that is a difficult thing for [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=566.54s)]
*  politicians, but I think it is necessary because we have been extremely naive. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=572.54s)]
*  We have been thinking about, many people have been thinking about the world how they would like [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=578.54s)]
*  it to be in the last 30 years and not necessarily how it actually looks like. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=582.54s)]
*  And we, the military, we're always seen, and the intelligence services in particular, we're [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=588.54s)]
*  seen as the pessimists and the people that were always looking for trouble, but I think we have [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=593.54s)]
*  neglected those signs that were there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=599.54s)]
*  Russia since 2008 in Georgia, 2014 Crimea, 2022, the whole war in Ukraine. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=603.54s)]
*  We knew they were behaving differently, and still we said, no, no, no, we need them economically. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=611.54s)]
*  We need them, Nord Stream, all the things we heard about. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=617.54s)]
*  And then they were suddenly not as friendly as we wanted them to be. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=621.54s)]
*  And then suddenly they used economic weapons against us, and everybody was surprised, and actually [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=626.54s)]
*  we shouldn't. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=631.54s)]
*  So I think the wake-up call also for the businesses is you have to think about what would you do, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=632.54s)]
*  and maybe I can ask the question to the public, if you allow me, which company in this room [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=639.54s)]
*  actually thinks about what do I have to change, what do I have to do if war hits us? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=645.54s)]
*  Anybody, just a show of hands, is this something that people have in their minds? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=652.54s)]
*  I see two hands. That's sort of reassuring. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=658.54s)]
*  Number one. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=663.54s)]
*  Maybe at the end we'll take a few questions or comments, and maybe we can come back to this. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=665.54s)]
*  That is not impressive, to be honest. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=669.54s)]
*  And I think one of three. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=671.54s)]
*  So that's a 50% increase. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=675.54s)]
*  But no, I think it is in a way a wake-up call. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=681.54s)]
*  It's not something far away. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=687.54s)]
*  It is close. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=689.54s)]
*  The factory that was burning last week in Germany, which is a company that makes air defense missiles, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=691.54s)]
*  there's growing proof that it's probably sabotage, and that it's not... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=699.54s)]
*  One can expect actually that the Russians are engaged in that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=707.54s)]
*  So it's not all in Ukraine. It's not in Syria. It's not in faraway countries. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=711.54s)]
*  It is in Europe, in Western Europe. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=716.54s)]
*  I want to pick up on something that you've mentioned in your work, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=721.54s)]
*  that you've been out trying to promote the defense industry, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=725.54s)]
*  which is another one of these fields that people have long thought is out there, but really is much more central. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=729.54s)]
*  And in working to coordinate and build it, you've encountered issues, mainly in Europe, I believe, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=734.54s)]
*  with ESG rules, environmental, social, corporate governance rules, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=742.54s)]
*  that get in the way of promoting, supporting the defense sector. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=747.54s)]
*  Could you talk a bit about that? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=752.54s)]
*  Yeah. So first and foremost, I think the government's politics, or all of us, the people, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=754.54s)]
*  are to be blamed for the fact that we broke down and disinvested in defense for 30 years. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=761.54s)]
*  So it's understandable when a lot of these factories went bankrupt or had to close because there were no orders, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=767.54s)]
*  that people are sort of cautious to start to reinvest in the defense industry, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=774.54s)]
*  because they might think it's probably only a couple of years and then there's trouble again. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=780.54s)]
*  But one, I think, we are, everything that is happening now is part of something much bigger than Ukraine. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=789.54s)]
*  This is about the rebalancing of power between the US and China. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=798.54s)]
*  This is about the tectonic plates of power that are shifting, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=803.54s)]
*  and when the tectonic plates on Earth do that, you have earthquakes, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=807.54s)]
*  and if the tectonic plates of power shift, you have wars, and that's what we see. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=813.54s)]
*  And the US is partly withdrawing from the world theater, and we saw it in Syria, we saw it in Crimea, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=818.54s)]
*  and we saw it in Georgia in 2008, so suddenly people thought, hey, the US is doing nothing. That's interesting. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=827.54s)]
*  And then other nations saw the void and stepped in. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=835.54s)]
*  And that is what we see now. Russia is an interesting country because the economy is the size of Spain or the Benelux, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=839.54s)]
*  but it has nuclear weapons, and therefore it is a party to take seriously. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=848.54s)]
*  But China is, in terms of their economy, their population, and their ambitions, a serious competitor of the US. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=854.54s)]
*  So that is what is happening, and I think for the next 15 years we will see all the results of that struggle and that rebalancing of power. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=863.54s)]
*  And then there is North Korea and Iran that also use the opportunity that now Russia needs them, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=872.54s)]
*  and therefore from being extremely isolated, they are now suddenly in the spotlights, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=879.54s)]
*  and because Russia loves them suddenly, they are less isolated and less isolated. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=884.54s)]
*  So they are actually on stage now in many, many ways. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=889.54s)]
*  And for Iran, with Hamas and Hezbollah and the Houthis, they also play a role of significance. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=893.54s)]
*  So therefore all that is happening, and I think we will see this for the next 15 years. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=903.54s)]
*  Therefore, if you want to invest in the defense industry, I think it's a good investment. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=909.54s)]
*  And it's unfortunate in a way because the world is in turmoil, but it's a good investment. That's one. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=914.54s)]
*  Second, when I'm talking to the financial institutions, and I don't know whether a CEO is a financial institution here, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=920.54s)]
*  but it's fascinating because in Western Europe and in Scandinavia there's actually pension funds and banks [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=927.54s)]
*  that say it's not ethical to invest in the defense industry, which I find mind-boggling. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=936.54s)]
*  The pension fund where all the military personnel of the Netherlands is, at ABP, which is a huge fund, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=943.54s)]
*  it has about 15 billion euros in investments, 1,500 billion. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=952.54s)]
*  And they say, they are, so my pension is there, but they're not investing in the industry [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=958.54s)]
*  that makes the stuff that I need for my work, which is very strange. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=968.54s)]
*  And I say this in public and they don't like me for it, but I think it is ridiculous. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=973.54s)]
*  And then of course they say, no, no, no, we do invest in weapons, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=980.54s)]
*  but we do not invest in companies that are connected to the nuclear weapon industry or cluster mines or chemical bio weapons. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=986.54s)]
*  I can understand that, although we are a nuclear alliance, and all of us as a result are safer with that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=996.54s)]
*  So it's sort of these discussions. I'm against war, people say very often to me. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1006.54s)]
*  I can say, well, I'm against war too, don't you worry. I'm in favor of peace. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1013.54s)]
*  But you have to do things to make sure we remain in peace. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1018.54s)]
*  And if you want to have peace, you better prepare for war. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1022.54s)]
*  So that's what I say, but it takes a lot of time. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1026.54s)]
*  To change things in our economy, you have to convince people. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1030.54s)]
*  It's about private investors, it's not the government that orders the industry around, it is like in Russia. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1034.54s)]
*  The Russians are to have changed to a war economy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1039.54s)]
*  And that means that everything is serving the efforts of Russia in Ukraine, period. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1042.54s)]
*  And so the production of artillery, grenades, missiles, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery pieces, everything is up. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1048.54s)]
*  Of course, it is to the detriment of their economy because they do not add any value to the economy anymore. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1056.54s)]
*  So I understand the reluctance, don't get me wrong, but we need to do more. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1063.54s)]
*  Because if the Russians win in Ukraine, that's not the end of problems, but it's the beginning of much more. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1068.54s)]
*  So it is about convincing, therefore. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1075.54s)]
*  It takes a lot of time in democracies. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1077.54s)]
*  I see the first science groundbreaking work for a Patriot factory in Germany, groundbreaking work for an artillery factory in Germany, the Swedes, the Finns, the Danes. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1080.54s)]
*  There is things starting to happen now. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1089.54s)]
*  But that means after two years in the war that they at least need a year to one and a half years before those factories actually produce more artillery, grenades and missiles. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1092.54s)]
*  So we have to bridge that gap for the Ukrainians because they don't lack courage, they lack weapons and ammunition. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1103.54s)]
*  So we have to provide them with that, and that is what needs to be done now. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1112.54s)]
*  So you advocate Western society should take a broader view, NATO countries should take a broader view of what security and defense mean. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1117.54s)]
*  NATO's two new members, Finland and Sweden, take what is called an all of society view of security. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1125.54s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about what NATO can learn from its new members? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1133.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think traditionally the Scandinavian navies have an approach, much more a whole of government approach. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1138.54s)]
*  Not only with regard to war, but also with disaster and things like that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1149.54s)]
*  So they work closer together and coordinate better than in many other nations. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1154.54s)]
*  But yes, I think the people in Finland understand that the best, they had to take care of their own defense for the last 80 years and they were neutral. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1160.54s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you don't have to make sure that you are safe. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1172.54s)]
*  So they have a huge army, they have a huge armed forces, and a huge reserves. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1176.54s)]
*  It's like 220,000 active duty and then 800,000 reservists, which is a million out of a population of five and a half million. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1182.54s)]
*  So that is big. So that is big. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1193.54s)]
*  Then the million troops in the US is compared to your population, suddenly a relatively small number. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1196.54s)]
*  So I think they understand that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1204.54s)]
*  So I think in terms of collective defense, we can learn a lot from the Finns. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1207.54s)]
*  Because in NATO, the Washington Treaty is a very short treaty actually, as business people you would love it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1212.54s)]
*  It's like a couple of pages, 14 articles, in 1949. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1220.54s)]
*  And Article 3 talks about, everybody knows Article 5, which is an attack on one, is an attack on all. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1226.54s)]
*  For a long time, we thought NATO was sort of an emergency. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1232.54s)]
*  If you were in trouble, you would call 911, you got the NATO headquarters, and then we would look in the list. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1236.54s)]
*  And then if the problem was in Portugal and the Netherlands is on duty, then the Netherlands would help Portugal. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1243.54s)]
*  Unexecurating on purpose, but that was the NATO Response Force idea. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1250.54s)]
*  But Article 3 is for a purpose before Article 5. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1255.54s)]
*  And Article 3 says every nation has to be able to defend itself. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1261.54s)]
*  And we have neglected that to a very, very large extent. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1266.54s)]
*  Because we always thought somebody else is coming to rescue me. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1270.54s)]
*  And especially a lot of nations thought the US is going to rescue us. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1274.54s)]
*  So the fact that a lot of politicians in the US, including President Trump, before the question comes, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1278.54s)]
*  talks about Europe and Canada need to do more. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1286.54s)]
*  And that is true. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1293.54s)]
*  We agreed in 1949 that nobody would pay more than 50% of the bill. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1295.54s)]
*  And the idea was basically the US pays 50% and the rest pays the other half. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1299.54s)]
*  Then we were with 12. Now we are with 32. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1304.54s)]
*  The US pays between 60 and 65% of the bill for a long time already. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1308.54s)]
*  So I am fully aware and I fully understand that the US is sick and tired of that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1314.54s)]
*  So yes, Europe and Canada need to do more. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1321.54s)]
*  So that's the reason why not under Trump but under Obama, the Wales agreement was in 2014 to go towards the 2%. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1325.54s)]
*  That's why now under Biden, not Trump, it's a minimum of 2% since Vilnius last year. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1334.54s)]
*  But it's not paying your dues. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1341.54s)]
*  And that's what I don't think that is not what if President Trump says the nations that do not pay up, I'm not going to defend them. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1343.54s)]
*  That's not helpful for a number of reasons. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1351.54s)]
*  It's not the dues of your paying the dues of your country club because the 2% the minimum of 2% is not for someone else. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1353.54s)]
*  It is for yourself. It's for your own armed forces. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1362.54s)]
*  It's for your ability to defend yourself. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1366.54s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1369.54s)]
*  Second, unity is at the core of who we are. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1370.54s)]
*  Because Article 5, which is if one is attacked, all of the other nations come to the rescue, means that you have to trust each other blindly. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1376.54s)]
*  And I think that's why it's dangerous to talk like that. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1386.54s)]
*  It's not a transactional discussion. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1390.54s)]
*  It is an agreement. It's a promise. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1392.54s)]
*  So you mentioned Trump. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1396.54s)]
*  That didn't occur to me to ask you about Trump. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1398.54s)]
*  Since you bring him up. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1401.54s)]
*  Even IKEA got a question. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1403.54s)]
*  The Trump years were kind of traumatic at NATO. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1405.54s)]
*  Well, you know, and I got this question. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1410.54s)]
*  I get this question very often. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1413.54s)]
*  We're 75 years old and we have weathered quite a number of storms. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1415.54s)]
*  In 1966, France left the military part of the organization. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1421.54s)]
*  Basically, everyone thought this is the end of NATO. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1427.54s)]
*  We were in Paris. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1430.54s)]
*  The headquarters was in Paris. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1431.54s)]
*  I blame the French still for leaving and coming back in 2009, which they have done militarily. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1432.54s)]
*  So that's so that's NATO as well. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1440.54s)]
*  They have returned. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1442.54s)]
*  They're part of the military part of the alliance again. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1443.54s)]
*  But we're still in Brussels. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1446.54s)]
*  But so we have weathered storms and I think that a president, whether whoever it is, is not going to change that necessarily. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1449.54s)]
*  I think what President Trump is primarily talking about is the fact that nations should do what they have promised. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1460.54s)]
*  And I agree with him there that nations, if they if leaders of nations promise to do something, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1469.54s)]
*  then they should do it and not go home and basically on purpose or willingly not do it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1475.54s)]
*  So I think being angry and annoyed about that is understandable. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1481.54s)]
*  So I think he has a he has a fair point. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1485.54s)]
*  So I don't think it's it's addressed against NATO per se. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1489.54s)]
*  I think the U.S. needs Europe because Europe is the biggest trading partner of the U.S. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1493.54s)]
*  So it's in the interest of the U.S. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1500.54s)]
*  to have a stable and secure Europe and we Europeans need United States. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1503.54s)]
*  So I think that is it's in all of our interest to stay in NATO, to work together. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1510.54s)]
*  And the one last thing I wanted to say about this, because that is also something and I didn't mention it earlier, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1517.54s)]
*  is the private sector for 80 years didn't have to think about is my factory there tomorrow morning. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1523.54s)]
*  Because it was always there tomorrow morning. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1529.54s)]
*  And in Ukraine, they open the window, the curtains in the morning, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1532.54s)]
*  and they hope their factory is there tomorrow morning because it could be gone as a result of a missile attack. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1535.54s)]
*  Now, because for 80 years, nobody in the private sector had to think about this. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1541.54s)]
*  It is not part of your thinking that defense and security is important [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1546.54s)]
*  because the foundation of economic activity is actually stability and security. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1551.54s)]
*  And it was always there. So you never gave it a thought. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1558.54s)]
*  And it's time you give it a thought. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1561.54s)]
*  Okay. Maybe on that, we have a few minutes left. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1564.54s)]
*  We'll take a couple of questions from the audience. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1567.54s)]
*  Gentleman over here, I think you were actually one of the people who raised his hand earlier. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1570.54s)]
*  Yes, I'm Jussi Tolmanen from Finland. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1574.54s)]
*  There you go. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1576.54s)]
*  Proof of your question. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1579.54s)]
*  So the question is around the technological decoupling. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1581.54s)]
*  So now clearly China is developing own technology from the scratch, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1585.54s)]
*  from silicon to chipsets to OOS and so on. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1588.54s)]
*  Do you see the risk of separation of technologies completely [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1591.54s)]
*  so that there would be Western technology in 10, 20 years from now [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1595.54s)]
*  and there will be Chinese technology which would be used in most parts of the world? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1598.54s)]
*  And how would that affect the defense side? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1603.54s)]
*  I think there is a danger of more different systems. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1607.54s)]
*  It's not only about technology, I think. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1614.54s)]
*  There is this discussion on the rules-based international order [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1616.54s)]
*  which was set up after World War II for a good reason, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1620.54s)]
*  because basically all the political leaders in the world, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1623.54s)]
*  including China and Russia, thought this never again. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1627.54s)]
*  So big power competition should not be fought on the battlefield. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1630.54s)]
*  If we have a difference of opinion, then we should sit down, talk about it, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1634.54s)]
*  and if we cannot agree, then we go to court. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1638.54s)]
*  That's basically what it is. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1641.54s)]
*  We agreed to respect each other's sovereignty [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1643.54s)]
*  and internationally recognized borders and things like that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1646.54s)]
*  And now suddenly that is not the case. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1649.54s)]
*  I mean, Russia, whatever nonsense arguments they use, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1652.54s)]
*  attacked a sovereign state with internationally recognized borders. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1656.54s)]
*  And so it's not only about technology, it's also about the rules-based order. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1660.54s)]
*  It's about the dollar versus other currencies. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1667.54s)]
*  So there's a lot of movement in basically breaking the world in different parts. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1671.54s)]
*  And then what does that mean economically, militarily, technology-wise, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1677.54s)]
*  but also rules-based-wise? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1682.54s)]
*  Is there going to be different sets of rules in the next ten years, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1684.54s)]
*  where if you're in Russia, China, and they are friends, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1688.54s)]
*  you're in a different set of rules? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1692.54s)]
*  If you get a harbor or a road or a railroad from China, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1694.54s)]
*  by the way, you don't get it, you have to pay back, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1699.54s)]
*  but if you have a problem with them in legal terms, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1702.54s)]
*  you have to go to a court in Beijing. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1706.54s)]
*  That's in the contract. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1709.54s)]
*  So you can't go to the court in your own country if you're in Uganda or whatever. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1711.54s)]
*  But you have to go to Beijing to solve the legal problem. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1715.54s)]
*  So I think, yes, there is a chance that we will see different worlds in that sense. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1718.54s)]
*  And also with different technological standards. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1726.54s)]
*  It is possible, I think. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1731.54s)]
*  So the globalization in that sense is changing now. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1734.54s)]
*  Maybe very quickly. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1738.54s)]
*  Okay, one last question here in the front. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1740.54s)]
*  Microphone. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1742.54s)]
*  If it's going to be a quick question, not sure. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1745.54s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1747.54s)]
*  And thank you for sharing your thoughts. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1749.54s)]
*  Bal Das from BGD Holdings. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1751.54s)]
*  I'm curious to pick up on one of the central points you made. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1753.54s)]
*  Your impressions on how as a society across generations [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1758.54s)]
*  do you think we are readying for the types of eventuality [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1765.54s)]
*  that you are speaking about to confront it? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1769.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1773.54s)]
*  Thank you for that question. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1775.54s)]
*  On a scale from me to we, the Chinese are here. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1779.54s)]
*  Everything is we. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1784.54s)]
*  Everything is about the population, about society. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1785.54s)]
*  So it's always about society first and then down the road somewhere there is a bit of me. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1790.54s)]
*  We are here. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1798.54s)]
*  We are here at the moment. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1799.54s)]
*  I think we have gone completely to the edge. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1800.54s)]
*  And it's all about me. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1804.54s)]
*  It's my privacy. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1805.54s)]
*  It's my rights. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1807.54s)]
*  It's all about me. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1808.54s)]
*  And I think we have to, and that's a political and societal discussion, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1809.54s)]
*  we have to move away from that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1813.54s)]
*  We have to understand that how many people live in the UK? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1815.54s)]
*  50, 60 million? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1820.54s)]
*  67. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1823.54s)]
*  The population of the UK is not the sum of 67 million individuals. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1826.54s)]
*  That's not a society. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1832.54s)]
*  So we have to move a bit away from the me, more we. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1834.54s)]
*  In the military we always know and learn the team is always more important than the individual [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1838.54s)]
*  because you survive as a result of your teammates. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1845.54s)]
*  If you get wounded, a teammate gets you out of the battlefield. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1849.54s)]
*  So that sort of lessons, that sort of attitude, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1852.54s)]
*  the importance of understanding you're part of a bigger thing, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1857.54s)]
*  whether it is a village, a town, a community, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1861.54s)]
*  is I think something we need to invest in. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1865.54s)]
*  We need to talk about this much more. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1870.54s)]
*  And we have gone from also sort of your own responsibility. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1872.54s)]
*  It's almost taken out of our hands. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1881.54s)]
*  If you go to a playground, the floor is now rubber tiles [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1883.54s)]
*  so that nobody can hurt himself or herself. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1888.54s)]
*  I mean, why? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1892.54s)]
*  Just be careful. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1894.54s)]
*  No, but I mean, so everything is thought for you. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1896.54s)]
*  And why? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1901.54s)]
*  Because we have a zero-risk society. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1902.54s)]
*  And war is about taking risk and is about understanding [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1905.54s)]
*  what the consequences are of what you're going to do. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1911.54s)]
*  And so we have to move away from zero risk, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1914.54s)]
*  from efficiency thinking to effectiveness thinking, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1917.54s)]
*  from only efficiency and accountability, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1920.54s)]
*  the holy grails of the last 30 years, to effectiveness. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1923.54s)]
*  In a war, it's about winning or losing. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1926.54s)]
*  Nobody in Ukraine talks about how expensive a Patriot missile is. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1929.54s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1934.54s)]
*  They want more because that is about winning or losing. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1935.54s)]
*  So all these things, your own responsibility, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1938.54s)]
*  why have we outsourced our external security to the armed forces? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1941.54s)]
*  Outsourced. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1947.54s)]
*  We give them money. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1948.54s)]
*  Don't talk about it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1949.54s)]
*  I want to continue with my life here. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1951.54s)]
*  Internal security to the police. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1953.54s)]
*  I want to live my life. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1955.54s)]
*  Me. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1958.54s)]
*  And so if all of us want more security, which is the case, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1959.54s)]
*  that's why the politicians now pay the 2% [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1964.54s)]
*  because they smell the people are afraid. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1966.54s)]
*  That's why they give the 2%. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1969.54s)]
*  And so then the problem, to solve the problem of more personnel [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1971.54s)]
*  for the armed forces, more defense production capability, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1975.54s)]
*  is not only a problem for the chief of defense [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1980.54s)]
*  and the minister of defense. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1982.54s)]
*  It's a societal problem. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1983.54s)]
*  We want more security. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1986.54s)]
*  If we don't find the people for professional armed forces, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1987.54s)]
*  you have to think about conscription, reservists, mobilization. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1992.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1997.54s)]
*  If there is war, after a couple of months, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=1998.54s)]
*  you don't only need new bullets and new tanks and new armored vehicles, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2001.54s)]
*  but unfortunately also new military men and women [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2005.54s)]
*  because they die and they get wounded. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2008.54s)]
*  All these things have been in the back of our minds for so long [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2012.54s)]
*  that we thought it will never come back, and I don't want to hear about it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2017.54s)]
*  If young people are asked the question, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2022.54s)]
*  would you like to die for your country? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2024.54s)]
*  It's a ridiculous question in our societies. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2026.54s)]
*  So of course they say no. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2029.54s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2031.54s)]
*  But the day there is a war, like in Ukraine, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2033.54s)]
*  then people suddenly understand what is at stake. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2037.54s)]
*  If the Russians stop the war today and go home, the war is over. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2041.54s)]
*  If the Ukrainians stop the war today, they have lost their country. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2045.54s)]
*  So all the discussions on they should stop, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2050.54s)]
*  they should give in peace talks, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2052.54s)]
*  it's because we want to get rid of the war. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2055.54s)]
*  We, because we think it's a nuisance. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2058.54s)]
*  It interferes with our steady life. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2061.54s)]
*  The higher prices in the supermarket is the result of the war in Ukraine. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2065.54s)]
*  So if the war stops, then the prices go down. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2070.54s)]
*  And it won't. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2073.54s)]
*  It won't. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2075.54s)]
*  Because, you know, weapons, energy, food have been used as a weapon [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2076.54s)]
*  and will be used as a weapon. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2081.54s)]
*  Raw materials will be used as a weapon. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2083.54s)]
*  So we have to get used that we won't go back to normal for the next 15 years. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2086.54s)]
*  We have to understand we are part of the solution. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2092.54s)]
*  It's not them of the armed forces. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2096.54s)]
*  It's not them of the government. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2099.54s)]
*  We together need to solve this problem. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2101.54s)]
*  That is my plea. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbSIFpt_UQ&t=2104.54s)]
