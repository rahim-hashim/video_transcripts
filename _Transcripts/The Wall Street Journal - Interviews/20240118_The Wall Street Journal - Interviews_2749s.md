# Al Gore on the State of ESG and the Energy Transition | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw)
*  I want to rewind exactly one year ago, around this time at Davos, you issued a dire warning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=0.0s)]
*  about climate change, about the fact that emissions are still going up, and you called [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=8.5s)]
*  for urgency in addressing this issue. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=13.18s)]
*  Has anything changed since 12 months ago? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=16.06s)]
*  It's gotten worse. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=19.26s)]
*  But balancing the appropriate sense of urgency with the legitimate hope that we can solve [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=23.880000000000003s)]
*  this crisis is really an important task because there are some people that go straight from [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=36.04s)]
*  denial to despair without pausing on the intermediate step of actually dealing with the crisis. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  And that's actually where we are right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=50.62s)]
*  But in order to deal with it, it really is important to understand the severity of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=53.66s)]
*  danger that we face. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  And that part of the message is difficult for many people to hear for natural, understandable [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=65.88s)]
*  reasons. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  You hear this phrase, existential risk. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  It is that and more. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  And just to briefly define what the nature of the crisis is, we are spewing 162 million [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=81.86s)]
*  tons of human-caused heat-trapping pollution into the sky every day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=94.62s)]
*  When I say into the sky, it's the thin blue shell, the part of the sky that's blue because [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=105.2s)]
*  it's the oxygen that makes it blue. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=112.34s)]
*  And it's thin enough that if you could drive a car straight up in the air at Autobahn or [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  interstate highway speeds, you would get to the top of that blue line in five to seven [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=124.66s)]
*  minutes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=131.02s)]
*  You could walk it in an hour. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=132.18s)]
*  It's that thin. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=134.62s)]
*  And it's that thin shell that we're using as an open sewer for the gaseous waste of our [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=136.5s)]
*  civilization. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  And the molecules involved with greenhouse gas pollution, principally CO2, but also methane, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=145.8s)]
*  and there are some others in smaller amounts, percentages. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=153.08s)]
*  The average molecule of a greenhouse gas that we put up there every day lingers there for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  about 100 years, which means it mounts up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=167.62s)]
*  The amount continues to accumulate and traps heat. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  We get the energy from the sun in the form of light, and the earth is heated up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=176.34s)]
*  And then it's reradiated into space as infrared. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=181.3s)]
*  And some of the outgoing infrared is naturally trapped by the natural greenhouse gas layer, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=184.74s)]
*  which is good because it keeps temperatures within boundaries that are appropriate and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=190.72s)]
*  conducive to the flourishing of life on earth, including human life. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  But we are building up the amount of heat trapping capacity so much that today we trapped [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=200.8s)]
*  as much extra heat as would be released by 750,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=211.6s)]
*  on the earth every 24 hours. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=221.74s)]
*  So are you? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=224.24s)]
*  I know we—and I'll try not to filibuster here, but I want to put it in context because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=227.24s)]
*  it has to do with that balance between hope and despair that I want to hit correctly because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=234.32s)]
*  it's really important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  You don't want to turn people off. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  We can solve this, but it's important to understand what's happening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=243.24s)]
*  And that extra heat is raising temperatures, threatening to make much larger areas of the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=247.4s)]
*  earth physiologically unlivable, generating a massive flow of climate refugees migrating [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  across international borders, as many as a billion in this century, according to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=261.36s)]
*  Lancet Commission. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=265.64s)]
*  A study reported in the journal Nature yesterday recalculates the amount of ice on Greenland [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=268.6s)]
*  that's melting 30 million tons per hour. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=275.36s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy stuff, what we're doing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=278.36s)]
*  And the melting ice raises sea level. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  It's threatening to—it's already slowed the Gulf Stream, which is part of this larger [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=285.72s)]
*  ocean conveyor belt, as they call it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  Some are worried that it will shut down, which would be utterly catastrophic, threatening [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=294.08s)]
*  to thaw the frozen permafrost, which makes up one-third of the landmass in the northern [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=298.44s)]
*  hemisphere, which could trigger a kind of a runaway situation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=305.4s)]
*  So it's very, very dangerous stuff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=309.12s)]
*  Last year was the hottest year ever by the largest margin of increase ever. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=311.96s)]
*  Half of the days last year in 2023 were above 1.5 degrees, which is what the scientists [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=317.96s)]
*  say we should stay below. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=323.72s)]
*  Two days in November were two degrees above pre-industrial. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  Tropical diseases are driven to the higher latitudes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  The storms are getting much stronger every night on the TV news, like a nature hike through [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=333.48s)]
*  the Book of Revelation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=338.12s)]
*  We're seeing the rain bombs and the floods and the mudslides, and the same extra heat [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=340.12s)]
*  is causing the droughts, which are threatening agricultural production. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=345.36s)]
*  The food system is at a higher level of risk of multi-breadbasket failure than we could [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=351.92s)]
*  ever have imagined was possible. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=359.92s)]
*  We're seeing fires, 18.5 million hectares burned in Canada this year, 45 million acres. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=363.8s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  My farm in Tennessee, we were breathing smoke from the fires in Canada. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=375.12s)]
*  You've seen in New York where your newspaper is located. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=379.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, it looked like, I mean, it's amazing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=382.44s)]
*  So these things are driving public concern appropriately. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=387.24s)]
*  But here's the good news, okay? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=393.68s)]
*  We have the ability to solve this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=395.76s)]
*  We really do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=397.2s)]
*  And some of the new scientific findings are very optimistic and exciting. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=398.64s)]
*  If we reach, sorry to turn my back on you all. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=404.56s)]
*  If we reach true net zero and stop adding to the amount of the seat trapping gas up [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=408.32s)]
*  there, the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately with a lag of as little [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=414.52s)]
*  as three to five years. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=420.24s)]
*  And even more exciting, if we stay at true net zero, half, 50% of all of the human-caused [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=421.76s)]
*  greenhouse gas pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=430.88s)]
*  And we can start the healing process. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  You talk about carbon removal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=440.4s)]
*  You don't want to build these ridiculous giant mechanical vacuuming machines in order, you [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=442.12s)]
*  know, the oil, gas, energy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=447.24s)]
*  We could keep burning fossil fuels. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=448.64s)]
*  We'll just capture the emissions as they go up there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=449.76s)]
*  It doesn't work in a realistic way for a reason we go into. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=452.48s)]
*  But we can let Mother Nature do the work for us. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=456.44s)]
*  What goes up must come down. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=460.02s)]
*  Obey the first law of holes. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=461.82s)]
*  When you're in one, stop digging. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=463.02s)]
*  So you're saying this is possible, but we've known about all of this for quite some time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=464.46s)]
*  Why haven't we done it yet? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  Well first of all, because it's hard. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=472.74s)]
*  But second of all, it's not quite precise to say we've known all of the things that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  I just spooled out there for a long time. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=480.18s)]
*  We have had these warnings in more elliptical form from the scientists for quite a long [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=483.6s)]
*  time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=490.04s)]
*  You're quite right about that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=491.04s)]
*  And I've been trying to get this message out, interpreting the scientists' warnings for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=492.20000000000005s)]
*  decades now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=497.24s)]
*  And you know, I think that due to the fact that the warnings they issued years ago turned [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  out to be spot on accurate should lead us to pay a little more attention to what they're [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=506.74s)]
*  saying will happen in the future if we don't implement the solutions that are available. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=513.04s)]
*  And when I say they're available, just give me a second on this because it's an important [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=520.7199999999999s)]
*  part of the hope message. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=524.2199999999999s)]
*  The International Energy Agency says, and has documented this thoroughly, we don't have [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=526.4s)]
*  to wait for new technologies. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  There are some people who say, oh, we just need to do research and develop new technologies. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=534.0s)]
*  I'm all for that. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  But we have everything we need today with proven deployment models to reduce the greenhouse [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=538.84s)]
*  gas emissions by 50 percent in this decade. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=546.84s)]
*  We have a clear line of sight to how we can get the rest of the other 50 percent by mid-century. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=550.6s)]
*  And we can solve this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=559.0600000000001s)]
*  Now there are two big obstacles to it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=561.48s)]
*  The global system for allocating private capital discriminates against developing countries [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=564.76s)]
*  where most of the increase in emissions is due to come from. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=573.2s)]
*  We have to, because of currency risk, if you're in Nigeria, you want to build a solar farm, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=577.08s)]
*  which you will want to do because it's great for them, your interest rates will be seven [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=581.64s)]
*  times higher than the interest rates paid here in Switzerland or in the U.S. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  And that means they are effectively blocked. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=592.88s)]
*  And private capital is what's necessary. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=595.24s)]
*  86 percent of all the build out of solar and wind is done with private capital. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=597.0200000000001s)]
*  Last year, worldwide, if you look at all of the new electricity generation installed worldwide [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=601.5400000000001s)]
*  last year, 80 percent of it was solar and wind. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=608.0200000000001s)]
*  In India, it was 93 percent. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=610.7800000000001s)]

*  That's the first obstacle. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=615.2600000000001s)]
*  Second obstacle is that the least responsible actors among the petro states and the fossil [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=616.5400000000001s)]
*  fuel companies are devoting an incredible amount of money and energy and unethical passion [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=621.98s)]
*  into blocking progress. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=628.98s)]
*  They have been standing in the way for decades, some of them engaged in outright massive fraud. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=631.9s)]
*  It's been well documented. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=639.9s)]
*  Your newspaper has reported on this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=641.1s)]
*  And there have been books written about it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=643.34s)]
*  And it's not really challenged. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, they use the blueprint from the tobacco companies when the Surgeon General's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=647.6999999999999s)]

*  They hired actors and dressed them up as doctors to go on camera and falsely tell people that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=657.1s)]
*  smoking is fine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=663.4599999999999s)]
*  The fossil fuel companies hired the same PR firms, the same pseudo scientists to go out [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=664.9399999999999s)]
*  and do the same thing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=672.3s)]
*  Some of those zombie memes are still rattling around through the comment sections of every [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=674.7s)]
*  single news publication or website in the world every time a climate article. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=680.14s)]
*  And a new wave of climate denial has just been launched. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=685.6600000000001s)]
*  You may have seen the study this week. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=688.94s)]
*  And the American Petroleum Institute, the number one lobby group for the American oil [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=691.26s)]
*  and gas firms, just announced a brand new eight-figure advertising campaign to convince [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=696.38s)]
*  the American people that it's impossible to transition away from fossil fuels. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=703.3s)]
*  It's not fair to ask them to solve this crisis for us. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=708.02s)]
*  But damn if it's not fair to ask them to stop blocking the efforts of everybody else to [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=712.02s)]
*  solve this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=716.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, I press my own buttons these days. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=719.3s)]
*  So I can't help it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=722.5s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=724.9s)]
*  VP Gore, I do want to pivot to politics because I've been talking with investors, business [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=726.0999999999999s)]
*  leaders all week. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=730.42s)]
*  This is on everyone's mind. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=731.62s)]
*  We have a big election coming up. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=732.82s)]
*  And you've hailed the Inflation Reduction Act as one of the biggest and best climate [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=735.5400000000001s)]
*  acts in history. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=740.4200000000001s)]
*  Are you afraid it could get repealed or parts of it rolled back if Republicans gain control [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=742.1s)]
*  of Congress or Trump wins? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=748.2600000000001s)]
*  Well first of all, I think that the Inflation Reduction Act is by far the best, most lavishly [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=755.62s)]
*  funded climate legislation any country's ever passed. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=760.58s)]
*  And the sticker price or the estimates of how much it would deploy were in the $370 [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=764.1s)]
*  billion range. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=770.34s)]
*  But the heavy lifting is done with tax credits that are open ended. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=771.7s)]
*  And the estimates now are as high as $1.2 trillion. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=775.62s)]
*  That's already creating a new political reality on the ground in the U.S. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=782.94s)]
*  I went to an event in D.C. hosted by the trade group representing electric vehicle manufacturers [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=787.86s)]
*  and lithium miners and the battery. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=795.54s)]
*  So the lead off speaker was a MAGA Republican Trump supporter from coastal Georgia in Congress [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=798.66s)]
*  who had voted against certifying the election in 2020. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=806.74s)]
*  And he made a terrific speech touting the virtues of electric vehicles. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=816.3399999999999s)]
*  Maybe because the largest battery manufacturing plant in North America is being built in his [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=817.38s)]
*  congressional district. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=823.54s)]
*  And that story is being repeated all across the U.S. especially in the red states and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=824.82s)]
*  for reasons probably, you know, I don't want to go into all that, maybe labor law, maybe [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=831.54s)]
*  wages. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=836.18s)]
*  But in any case, there are new political realities being created on the ground. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=836.82s)]
*  The Republican governor of Georgia was supposed to be here at Davos, I think he came, promoting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=842.18s)]
*  electric vehicles here. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=846.98s)]
*  I mean, and so this is not a foregone conclusion. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=848.58s)]
*  And by the way, the filibuster in the Senate, which ought to be repealed, nevertheless stays [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=854.26s)]
*  in existence. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=860.02s)]
*  It's way harder to repeal a law after it's been passed. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=861.14s)]
*  And when you have increased political support for a very popular set of programs that the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=865.14s)]
*  IRA has initiated, I think that the odds are even if we saw the change in the presidency [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  that you referred to, I try not to use that name, then I think that it's not an automatic [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=880.1800000000001s)]
*  that it is, that it would be repealed. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=890.1800000000001s)]
*  I think this is an inexorable change. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=893.62s)]
*  Solar and wind energy is the cheapest electricity in the history of the world. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=899.14s)]
*  And in 95 percent of the world today, it's the cheapest. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=903.54s)]
*  And it doesn't have the co-pollution, the particulate pollution that kills more than [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=907.38s)]
*  eight million people a year with lung diseases. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=911.38s)]
*  Oxford shows that it creates three times as many jobs per dollar invested as a dollar [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=914.66s)]
*  invested in the old dirty, poisonous fossil fuel economy. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=920.42s)]
*  So it is moving really fast on electric vehicles. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=925.14s)]
*  20 percent of all the new vehicles sold worldwide last year were electric. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=931.9399999999999s)]
*  If you look at two-wheelers, 50 percent were electric. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=935.62s)]
*  And you have battery swapping models there, and it's really taken off in the developing [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=938.98s)]
*  world as well. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=942.58s)]
*  Green hydrogen is beginning to get a lot of traction, regenerative agriculture, and sustainable [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=944.58s)]
*  forestry. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=950.1s)]
*  And the younger generation, by the way, 60 percent of young Republicans are really breathing [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=951.14s)]
*  fire about this. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=956.9s)]
*  They want their party to change. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=957.9399999999999s)]
*  60 percent of the American people generally say this has to be a top priority. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=959.78s)]
*  So I think we're going to solve this. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=964.58s)]
*  The serious question, though, is whether or not we will solve it in time. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=968.5s)]
*  Dire warnings coupled with legitimate hope that we can do this are really appropriate. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=974.58s)]
*  And here's the key to it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=982.82s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln said famously that with the support of the people, everything is possible. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=985.7s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=993.46s)]
*  Without the support of the people, nothing is possible. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=994.46s)]
*  Rudy Dornbusch, an economist from the last century who was a friend of mine, has a law [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=998.26s)]
*  named after him, and here's how it goes. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1003.18s)]
*  Things take longer to happen than you think they will, but then they happen faster than [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1005.98s)]
*  you thought they could. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1010.38s)]
*  We are very close to a political tipping point. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1012.54s)]
*  And those who are desperately fighting against the proposal of transitioning away from fossil [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1016.38s)]
*  fuels are trying to block this, but we got a lot of things on our side. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1023.38s)]
*  The technology tailwinds are amazing. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1027.5s)]
*  Last year, in calendar year 2023, the cost of solar went down another 50% year on year. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1031.3400000000001s)]
*  We have Mother Nature is the loudest participant in this debate right now, and the increasing [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1039.02s)]
*  frequency and severity of these extreme events are really causing a lot of people to look [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1045.8600000000001s)]
*  at their hold cards and say, I may not like the phrase global warming or the word climate, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  but something's going on here and we've got to take some steps to deal with it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1058.98s)]
*  That movement is inexorable. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1064.1s)]
*  So you talk about Republican support, but when I turn on the TV or I watch some of these [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1065.94s)]
*  Republican presidential candidates talk, they're talking about woke capitalism and talking [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1071.42s)]
*  against it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1077.6200000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1078.6200000000001s)]
*  You're seeing ESG become a dirty word in America. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1079.6200000000001s)]
*  Companies are rolling back some of their policies. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1082.5s)]
*  People are pulling money from some of these environmental funds. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  Is this the beginning of the end of sustainable investing? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1087.7s)]
*  No, I don't think so at all. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1090.5s)]
*  But first of all, let me say the explanation for a lot of the politicians you see on camera. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1093.8600000000001s)]
*  Very simple actually. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1101.3400000000001s)]
*  The fossil fuel companies are way better at capturing politicians than emissions. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1102.3400000000001s)]
*  unhealthy degree to which money drives political outcomes in a media-based political communication [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1111.66s)]
*  system where the candidate with the most money more often than not wins, not always, but [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1125.8200000000002s)]
*  more often than not, then the role of lobbyists and special interests money is extremely unhealthy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1130.94s)]
*  And that's the cause of this. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1141.02s)]
*  That's what's driving the talk against woke capitalism, you think? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1143.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1146.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1147.38s)]
*  Now, it's absurd really. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1148.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say this. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1149.38s)]
*  My partner and co-founder at Generation Investment Management, David Blood, and I have published [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1152.7s)]
*  several op-eds in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1158.94s)]
*  And the last one we published dealt with this specific issue. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1162.26s)]
*  And for anybody who wants more than I'm going to say briefly here, you can look it up online. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1165.46s)]
*  But actually, the way ESG has been rolled out is filled with problems. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1170.92s)]
*  And we weren't really surprised that it ran into difficulties because it has been used [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1177.94s)]
*  by some in a really almost a greenwashing way. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1184.7s)]
*  And so it's not surprising that it ran into problems. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1191.3s)]
*  But what you're finding with some of the large institutional investors getting scared of [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1194.14s)]
*  it is a direct result of captured politicians in red states taking instructions from the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1199.74s)]
*  overlords that control their views on these things to threaten the asset managers by saying, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1208.74s)]
*  if you don't stop talking about climate, we're going to prevent you from managing our pension [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1217.46s)]
*  fund. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1222.5s)]
*  And it gets to the point that's so ridiculous that here's an example. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1224.02s)]
*  An asset manager is looking at a potential investment. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1230.42s)]
*  And the company has what looks like it might be a big liability for a superfund site of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  hazardous chemical waste that may cost several billion dollars. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1241.58s)]
*  It becomes illegal for them to even consider that in analyzing the pros and cons of that [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  investment. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1253.26s)]
*  And because that's so obviously absurd, Republicans as well as Democrats, and this has been polled [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1254.26s)]
*  extensively, Republicans as well as Democrats are saying, hands off this. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1259.46s)]
*  Stop this nonsense. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1264.1s)]
*  And actually, and some, a few Republican officeholders in this arena who have not been captured are [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1265.8999999999999s)]
*  saying this is stupid. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1272.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's don't do this anymore. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1274.1s)]
*  So it'll play out and we'll get past this. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1275.78s)]
*  But the way ESG is defined has to be sharpened considerably. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1280.02s)]
*  Will Generation Investment Management keep using the term? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1285.9599999999998s)]
*  Or do you guys plan to show that? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1288.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1290.1s)]
*  We've never relied heavily on that term, but we're not afraid of it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1291.1s)]
*  We look at all of our investments and every aspect of the investing process through a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1293.98s)]
*  sustainability lens. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1301.22s)]
*  And it's not limited to climate, but that is a major factor. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1303.06s)]
*  And you know, the world is moving. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1307.8999999999999s)]
*  And there's an oft used story about the best ice hockey player in American history, Wayne [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1311.26s)]
*  Gretzky, who was phenomenal. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1320.34s)]
*  And when he was interviewed and asked, what's your secret? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1322.78s)]
*  Why are you so much better than everybody else? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1325.7s)]
*  And you may have heard this. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1328.14s)]
*  He said, well, it's very simple. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1329.14s)]
*  I don't skate to where the puck is. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1330.7s)]
*  I skate to where the puck is going to be. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1333.42s)]
*  And in investing, if you have good teams and good data and you really work hard to make [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1336.9s)]
*  your best estimates of where the puck's going to be, then that's a pretty good source of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1348.7s)]
*  advantage if you do it well. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1356.1000000000001s)]
*  And the metaphorical puck here is that the world is shifting toward sustainability for [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1359.5s)]
*  lots of reasons. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1368.98s)]
*  Companies represented here, you talk to your HR, you already know this, you don't have [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1372.02s)]
*  to talk to your HR head to know this. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1375.9399999999998s)]
*  When you're trying to hire the best young women and men coming into the firm, they're [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1378.74s)]
*  interviewing you now as the same time you're interviewing them. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1382.9799999999998s)]
*  And if they feel that you don't share their values, including a shared commitment to try [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1386.3s)]
*  to avoid destroying the future of humanity, then they're going to go work for some other [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1393.58s)]
*  firm that does. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1398.54s)]
*  And a lot of investors who are not scared off by this kind of political nonsense are [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1400.82s)]
*  saying, yeah, look, we want to put our money to work in a way that gets good returns, but [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1406.14s)]
*  we don't think you have to sacrifice value for values. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1411.42s)]
*  We see the world changing too, and we want to put our money to work in support of these [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1414.34s)]
*  companies that are placing bets on where that puck's going to be. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1418.66s)]
*  It just feels like the winds are kind of shifting in terms of all this, and I think DEI is a [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1422.66s)]
*  really good example of this. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1427.14s)]
*  That's part of socially responsible investing. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1428.46s)]
*  And one of the best examples of this is Claudine Gay, Harvard's first black president in its [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1431.26s)]
*  400-year history, just stepped down. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1437.54s)]
*  And her harshest critics said she only got there because of her race. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1440.22s)]
*  Can the DEI movement survive this moment that we're in politically? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1444.66s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure it's fair to lock in on the assumption that that's the only reason [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1449.78s)]
*  she was hard. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1454.9s)]
*  I'm not an expert on this and haven't really delved into all this. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1456.74s)]
*  That's what her critics are saying. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1459.0600000000002s)]
*  I understand, but I've also heard many talk about her distinguished record of scholarship. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1460.0600000000002s)]
*  Now, she had so many instances of plagiarism. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1466.42s)]
*  I mean, obviously it was a problem. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1468.74s)]
*  I'm just saying that's put DEI in the spotlight, and now people are trying to roll back some [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1471.9s)]
*  of those policies. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1476.46s)]
*  Yeah, but I would separate that case, where I think Harvard ended up making the right [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1477.46s)]
*  decision, clearly. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1481.8200000000002s)]
*  And by the way, I was among the many that was shocked at the tone deafness of the testimony [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1483.26s)]
*  before Congress when this came up. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1488.34s)]
*  All three of them apparently had the same lawyer. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1492.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not a poor guy. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1496.18s)]
*  I don't know whose name is, but they got very bad legal advice in how they handled it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1497.82s)]
*  But let's talk more about DEI as a separate and apart from this one case. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1502.7s)]
*  In the United States of America, if you look at the average family wealth of a black family, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1511.46s)]
*  and then you look at the average family wealth of a white family, you know what the difference [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1522.3400000000001s)]
*  is? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1528.3400000000001s)]
*  The average black family has an average wealth one-eleventh of an average white family. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1529.3400000000001s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1538.38s)]
*  It's not a mystery. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1539.74s)]
*  It's the accumulated legacy of the institutional structural discrimination and problems that [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1541.6200000000001s)]
*  have lingered for a long time after the horrors of slavery. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1553.8600000000001s)]
*  And these things have just not gone away. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1558.8200000000002s)]
*  We've made tremendous progress. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1561.1000000000001s)]
*  Hallelujah, have we ever. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1563.3000000000002s)]
*  It's still there. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1567.22s)]
*  On a business level, who was it making this case? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1571.46s)]
*  Oh, it was Mark Cuban in Dallas. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1577.58s)]
*  I really like the way he said it. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1581.98s)]
*  He said, look, if you have different hiring pools of people and you recognize that one [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1584.46s)]
*  or more pools have been ignored and passed over maybe because of these legacy discrimination [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1593.98s)]
*  factors, it's only smart to recognize there are going to be some super talented people [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1603.26s)]
*  in that pool that haven't been hired by others and give you a tremendous opportunity to put [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1609.5s)]
*  some great talent on the board. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1615.42s)]
*  I've seen that happen. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1618.42s)]
*  It's definitely the case. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1619.7s)]
*  So I think that for those two reasons and many others, it is another reason. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1621.38s)]
*  Michael Mobusong, a great professor. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1631.5400000000002s)]
*  He teaches a course at Columbia Business School. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1636.18s)]
*  He used to be taught by Warren Buffett's mentor. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1639.18s)]
*  Somebody can tell me. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  Charlie was his partner. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1644.6200000000001s)]
*  No, not Charlie. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1645.6200000000001s)]
*  Charlie was his partner. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1646.6200000000001s)]
*  And I miss Charlie. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1647.6200000000001s)]
*  He just passed. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1648.6200000000001s)]
*  Benjamin Graham. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1649.98s)]
*  Benjamin Graham. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1650.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1651.98s)]
*  Mobusong teaches that course now. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1653.82s)]
*  Great investor. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1655.7s)]
*  And he has made a sideline of really researching deeply the benefits of diversity in group decision [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1657.58s)]
*  making. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1667.02s)]
*  And what he's found in his research that every matrix, every difference, gender, race, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1668.82s)]
*  religion, ethnicity, orientation, every single difference adds to the efficacy of the group's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1682.7s)]
*  decision making process, except for one. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1696.18s)]
*  They have to share the same basic values. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1699.5s)]
*  I'll give you a quick example from science. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1704.18s)]
*  I'm prone to use these geeky metaphors sometimes to a fault. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1707.46s)]
*  But I took one of my daughters years ago out to, she's interested in science, and we went [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1711.8200000000002s)]
*  to the top of the volcano on the big island of Hawaii where they have the telescopes and [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1716.74s)]
*  the Kecks was, and for some purposes they say, well, now with the James Webb telescope, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1722.46s)]
*  nothing's as powerful as that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1728.7s)]
*  But this is the most powerful telescope in the world, particularly for looking at super [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1730.3s)]
*  nobis. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1733.66s)]
*  And they put all of these cutting edge advances in and segmented mirrors and software and [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1734.66s)]
*  all of this. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1740.14s)]
*  But the thing that caught my attention is they did two identical telescopes 60 meters [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1741.14s)]
*  apart. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1747.02s)]
*  And here's the thing that's startling. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1748.6200000000001s)]
*  When they look at an object in the universe 100 million light years away, the fact that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1750.94s)]
*  they're looking at it from two different points of view, a mere 60 meters apart on the surface [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1760.1000000000001s)]
*  of a small planet makes all the difference in the amount of meaning that can be gained [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1769.46s)]
*  from that observation. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1776.5s)]
*  The same thing is true when you have someone from an underrepresented minority or enough [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1778.5s)]
*  women because the main diversity that shows up in the research is you've got to have women's [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1787.3s)]
*  intelligence alongside men's intelligence. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1792.14s)]
*  Hard to believe, I know, because men have done such a great job in screwing up this [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1795.26s)]
*  world. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1800.06s)]
*  But if you have those differences, then your ability to reason together collectively is [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1801.82s)]
*  going to be enhanced. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1808.26s)]
*  You're going to make better decisions. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1809.26s)]
*  There are people who are for diversity, but against DEI. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1810.74s)]
*  I'm an Indian American woman. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1814.6599999999999s)]
*  If someone said to me, you only got that position because of your race, that would be incredibly [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1815.86s)]
*  distressing. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1821.1399999999999s)]
*  But that's what critics are saying these DEI policies are leading to. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  Is that fair to the people that these policies are trying to uplift? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1826.98s)]
*  I think that is a factor. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1832.74s)]
*  I know people who've made the same point that you just made. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1835.26s)]
*  That can be a psychological burden. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1839.54s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1841.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1842.5s)]
*  Why did I get this position? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1843.5s)]
*  I think that we're almost beyond that by now because everybody knows that there's such an [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1845.3799999999999s)]
*  advantage to having a diverse workforce that I don't think that's as big a deal as it might [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1850.82s)]
*  have been at some times in the past. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1856.18s)]
*  In any case, I think we have a societal moral obligation and practical imperative to try [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1859.5800000000002s)]
*  to get the U.S. past these horrific problems that are rooted in the past and the younger [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1866.5800000000002s)]
*  generation. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1874.22s)]
*  I mean, it's very different for the younger generation. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1875.22s)]
*  At least that's my impression. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1878.8200000000002s)]
*  Same with discrimination against gays and lesbians. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1881.66s)]
*  Young people, they say, what? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1885.98s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1888.78s)]
*  You're going to discriminate against somebody? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1889.78s)]
*  Because who did they fall in love with? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1891.42s)]
*  The way God made them? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1894.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1896.06s)]
*  I think that as we gain more experience in accepting the reality of who we are as human [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1897.06s)]
*  beings, I think we can get past that. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1904.6200000000001s)]
*  I want to open it up to the audience for questions. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1908.46s)]
*  Please get thinking and raise your hands. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1911.34s)]
*  I just have one more for VP Gore. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1912.74s)]
*  You recently stepped down from Apple's board because of a provision, I believe, that states [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1915.6999999999998s)]
*  that people at or above 75 cannot be up for reelection. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1919.26s)]
*  Do you think at 75 years old that you are too old to be on Apple's board? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1925.02s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1929.1799999999998s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1930.1799999999998s)]
*  But the age was raised while I was on the board. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1932.3799999999999s)]
*  So I got an extension anyway. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1938.6999999999998s)]
*  And since my birthday is in March and the annual meeting is in February, I got an extra [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1941.3s)]
*  year out of that deal too. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1946.02s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1947.62s)]
*  I'm not going to complain. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1948.62s)]
*  And you know, it has been such a blessing to serve for 21 years on the Apple board. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1950.4199999999998s)]
*  When I left the White House involuntarily, my friend Steve Jobs called me up and asked [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1959.34s)]
*  me to join the board. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1968.7s)]
*  I had met him in the 1970s when as a young member of the House of Representatives, I [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1969.7s)]
*  sponsored the Apple computer, the computer donate to schools legislation. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1974.98s)]
*  And we've been friends for a while. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1980.46s)]
*  And it has it is such a great company. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1982.14s)]
*  Tim Cook is such a great CEO. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1986.02s)]
*  My colleagues remaining on the board are fantastic. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1988.6200000000001s)]
*  It's absolutely fantastic. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  And the new board member is going to be an absolute superstar. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1996.3400000000001s)]
*  So I love Apple with all my heart. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=1999.46s)]
*  And I encourage everybody to invest in Apple. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2002.54s)]
*  Love it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2006.38s)]
*  I think you raised your hand and we have mics going around as well. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2007.38s)]
*  And if you could just introduce yourself. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2013.18s)]
*  Hello, my name is Konstantin. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2014.7s)]
*  I'm an investor from Germany. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2016.18s)]
*  And Mr. Vice President, thank you for the Macintosh in my dorm. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2017.66s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2023.26s)]
*  Recommend to everyone. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2024.26s)]
*  I was the only one in the Glengor White House with a Macintosh, by the way. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2025.26s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2028.44s)]
*  You mentioned the help from Mother Nature. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2030.16s)]
*  What about help from the free, the invisible hand of the market? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2033.98s)]
*  So the invisible hand of the market that is referred by the economists. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2040.22s)]
*  What stops us from using tradable emissions and having market resolve the much of the [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2045.66s)]
*  issue? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2053.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2054.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, I want to answer your question in two ways. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2055.2000000000003s)]
*  First of all, I am not opposed to carbon credits being traded in markets. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2059.0s)]
*  However, the record of the past years has been a record that has had way too much abuse [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2066.16s)]
*  in it. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2074.12s)]
*  It is not uncommon to examine closely the emissions credits that are sold and find that [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2075.7999999999997s)]
*  upwards of 90 percent are fraudulent and are just junk. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2083.24s)]
*  They analyzed chevrons offsets and found 93 percent were worthless or junk was the conclusion. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2087.54s)]
*  Now, I think it would be a big mistake to conclude from that record of abuse that has [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2097.18s)]
*  been all too common that we can't use such markets. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2103.82s)]
*  I think we should be able to use them. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2108.42s)]
*  We have to have safeguards and standards to protect the integrity of those markets. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2111.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2119.0s)]
*  Now, second thing I want to say, and you start talking about the invisible hand. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2120.0s)]
*  There is a deeper problem with the way we measure what is valuable in our economy. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2126.9199999999996s)]
*  This is difficult to solve. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2137.98s)]
*  When I was on the Joint Economic Committee in the Senate, I tried to solve this. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2139.3799999999997s)]
*  Gingrich came in. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2143.8999999999996s)]
*  They eliminated the program. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2144.8999999999996s)]
*  But the national accounts, which include GDP, which is the most famous part of it, and [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2147.1s)]
*  the corporate accounting systems that are derived from the national accounts date back [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2153.66s)]
*  to the 1930s after the Great Depression. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2158.18s)]
*  Economists tried to give policy makers better tools to avoid another depression. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2161.4199999999996s)]
*  Simon Kuznets was the famous award-winning economist who came up with the national accounts. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2165.96s)]
*  In 1937, when he received the award, he made a series of speeches in which he pleaded with [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2172.88s)]
*  policy makers, please don't use this system as a guide for national economic policies. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2178.64s)]
*  Then seven years later in Bretton Woods, it was codified and locked in. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2185.04s)]
*  Now it's like the QWERTY keyboard. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2188.88s)]
*  It no longer makes sense, but we're used to it and we can't get away from it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2190.44s)]
*  What did he say was wrong with it? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2194.4s)]
*  This is important. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2195.72s)]
*  It's important to understand how wacky our value measurement system is today. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2196.72s)]
*  It's a big part of the problem. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2201.7s)]
*  He said there are four things that are not included in the measurements that we rely on. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2203.66s)]
*  Number one, fairly well-known, negative externalities. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2208.22s)]
*  We've all heard that phrase. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2212.3399999999997s)]
*  Pollution falls into that category. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2214.1s)]
*  When a corporation or a government does the accounts, just ignore the pollution. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2216.54s)]
*  That's a negative externality. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2222.3399999999997s)]
*  Less well-known is the second factor, positive externalities. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2224.5s)]
*  If a community invests in mental health care, that is logged as an expense in the town's [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2230.4s)]
*  budget. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2236.52s)]
*  When the benefits come rolling back in, in the years and decades to follow, that's not [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2237.94s)]
*  counted as income. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2244.18s)]
*  So if your dashboard says we got to get the deficit down to zero and this expense is not [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2246.26s)]
*  bringing us any measurable benefits, then that's excluded. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  The third one is depreciation of natural resources. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2256.32s)]
*  Think about topsoil and underground water aquifers and, most important of all, the web [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  of living species, which is now at dire risk. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2264.7200000000003s)]
*  Not counted at all. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2269.56s)]
*  The fourth factor is the distribution of incomes and net worths. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2270.56s)]
*  That's not a choice between capitalism and socialism. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2275.52s)]
*  That is a set of choices that involve taxes and policies and monopoly enforcement and [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2277.98s)]
*  so forth. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2285.34s)]
*  So now, as a result of this wacky value system that's embedded in the way we decide what's [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2286.34s)]
*  valuable, you know the old saying, if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2292.14s)]
*  looks like a nail? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2295.78s)]
*  There's a similar syllogism. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2297.78s)]
*  If the only tool you have for measuring what's valuable is a price tag, things that don't [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2299.82s)]
*  have any price tag begin to look like they have no value. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2303.94s)]
*  So today, GDP goes up 3 percent. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2307.44s)]
*  China claims it just went up 5.2 percent. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2311.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's accompanied by vast increases in pollution, a continuing chronic underinvestment [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2315.0s)]
*  in education, mental health care, health care, environmental protection, pandemic preparedness, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2323.64s)]
*  nature, the reckless depletion of topsoil on which our future agriculture depends, and [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2331.32s)]
*  groundwater, which is being recklessly, and half of all living species at risk of extinction [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2339.0s)]
*  in the lives of people in this room. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2346.56s)]
*  And the emergence of hyper inequality, not only in developed but also developing countries, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2350.1400000000003s)]
*  with most of the income going to the very top end of the ladder, with most of the middle [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2357.4s)]
*  income working families seeing no inflation-adjusted increase in wages for 45 years. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2364.0s)]
*  So of course some of them are going to say, you know, you want me to vote for some outrageous [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2370.42s)]
*  monster who threatens to turn over the table? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2376.04s)]
*  Sounds good to me. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2378.92s)]
*  And so we get this wave of authoritarian populism in the world, not just the threat of what's [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2380.56s)]
*  might happen in the U.S. system, but in Hungary. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2388.32s)]
*  And you know, you get that guy getting a plurality in the Netherlands, and you can go through [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2391.32s)]
*  the list. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2397.6200000000003s)]
*  And so we've got to find a way to get more accurate in taking into account what is really [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2398.6200000000003s)]
*  valuable when we make our decisions. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2405.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2408.7000000000003s)]
*  Adnan Hassan. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2413.7000000000003s)]
*  We live on a small island in the Caribbean, and they're in Bonaire, which is one of the [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2415.06s)]
*  Dutch islands, and we're looking at wind and solar and hydrogen as a way to replace fossil [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2418.3399999999997s)]
*  fuels. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2423.58s)]
*  What's your view about the use of alternatives like hydrogen for smaller places that are [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2424.58s)]
*  isolated around the world? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2431.18s)]
*  And we're not the only island. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2432.18s)]
*  There are islands all across the planet. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2433.18s)]
*  And as we all know, we end up getting more impacted by the penalties, the externalities [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2435.22s)]
*  that are priced at zero. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  And also the climate-related extreme events, the hurricanes in the Caribbean, for example, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2443.5s)]
*  and the sea level rise and the acidification and high temperatures that are killing your [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2448.04s)]
*  tourism industry by destroying the reefs and the lives around the reefs. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2452.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  Generally speaking, having done some analysis in this area, there are many people far more [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2457.7999999999997s)]
*  expert than me, but generally speaking, all islands should immediately shift over to renewable [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2462.88s)]
*  energy. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2469.16s)]
*  The economics of transporting diesel in from far away, it's nuts. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2470.72s)]
*  So of course you should be shifting. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2475.3999999999996s)]
*  Now the second part of your question had to do with green hydrogen. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2477.12s)]
*  You know, we need more electrolyzers to make green hydrogen from breaking the bonds between [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2482.3799999999997s)]
*  hydrogen and oxygen. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2489.3199999999997s)]
*  Hydrogen used to be made mainly from methane. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  But when you hear about solar and wind, you will often hear about the problem of intermittency. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2498.3199999999997s)]
*  When the sun's not shining and the wind's not blowing, there are solutions to it, you [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2507.2799999999997s)]
*  know, and batteries are getting better. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2511.3999999999996s)]
*  But intermittency is like a coin with a flip side. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2512.9599999999996s)]
*  The flip side of the intermittency coin is that there are an increasing number of hours [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2517.4399999999996s)]
*  when there are very large surpluses of renewable electricity that has zero marginal cost. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2523.64s)]
*  It used to be that cracking the strong bonds in water between hydrogen and oxygen required [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2532.08s)]
*  so much energy it was too expensive to do it that way, so they went to the methane option. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2538.56s)]
*  Now if you have enough zero marginal cost for renewable electricity, you can profitably [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2544.12s)]
*  break those bonds and people are starting to do it. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2549.58s)]
*  And so what the capex is for putting all that machinery and all the electrolyzers on bond [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2553.22s)]
*  air, you'll have to ask somebody else whether it makes economic sense. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2559.14s)]
*  But generally speaking, if you have an island economy that's wealthy enough to build out [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2563.92s)]
*  a huge amount of solar and wind quickly, I think it does make sense to get the electrolyzers [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2570.2599999999998s)]
*  as well and go into the green hydrogen business. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2577.02s)]
*  So we are almost out of time. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2580.26s)]
*  I have one last question before I let you go. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2582.3s)]
*  John Kerry recently stepped down as climate envoy. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2585.1800000000003s)]
*  Would you raise your hand for the role? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2588.76s)]
*  Oh, well, I'm flattered that you would ask, but no. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2590.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, there's a pro-climate team out there and there are different positions on the field [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2597.38s)]
*  that need different kinds of players. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2604.82s)]
*  I was in government for a long time and I'm a recovering politician and the longer I go [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2607.1800000000003s)]
*  without a relapse, the less likely one becomes. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2615.96s)]
*  And one thing, by the way, let me just say in answer to your question that John Kerry [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2619.98s)]
*  deserves the gratitude of all Americans and people around the world. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2625.82s)]
*  He did a heroic job. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2630.26s)]
*  I really do. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2631.86s)]
*  And this may be mainly an American audience, but I want to add to that by saying Zhizhen [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2633.26s)]
*  Hua, the principal Chinese climate negotiator for the last couple of decades, also deserves [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2639.6600000000003s)]
*  the gratitude of people around the world. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2646.46s)]
*  He did a terrific job. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2649.94s)]
*  And John, he's quick to say he's not retiring. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2651.82s)]
*  He's going to help President Biden in his campaign, which he can't do under the Hatch [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2654.78s)]
*  Act if he's there. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2658.86s)]
*  He put three years of terrific work into that job and his success is going to have [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2660.5s)]
*  to be confirmed by the Senate, unlike when John, the law has been changed since John [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2666.06s)]
*  was appointed. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2670.62s)]
*  But I'm sure that President Biden will be able to find a really good replacement. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2671.78s)]
*  But the world will miss John's work in this area. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2676.1s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me today. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2680.18s)]
*  And I'm sorry we couldn't get to more questions. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2681.54s)]
*  Oh, can I say one other thing before we close? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2682.54s)]
*  We can solve this crisis. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2686.66s)]
*  We have everything we need. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2689.3s)]
*  The one factor that people worry we may not have in sufficient quantity is political will. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2691.32s)]
*  But the one thing to remember that I want to leave you with, because I came here not [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2699.2200000000003s)]
*  only to answer your questions and help the Wall Street Journal's event business, but [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2702.76s)]
*  I also came here to recruit you. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2709.9s)]
*  We need your help. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2713.96s)]
*  And I'm dead serious. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2715.82s)]
*  Some of you are already involved in this. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2716.94s)]
*  Those of you who are not, you think back to what you thought about the climate crisis [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2719.26s)]
*  five years ago and compare it to what you know now. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2723.34s)]
*  And then project forward a few years. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2726.66s)]
*  I guarantee you the difference is going to be starker still. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2728.26s)]
*  Because it's getting worse faster than we're deploying the solutions. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2732.54s)]
*  We have the ability to do it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2735.7400000000002s)]
*  And where political, the amount of political will necessary is concerned, please remember [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2737.02s)]
*  this always. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2741.66s)]
*  Political will is itself a renewable resource. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMOoO0p0Tbw&t=2743.34s)]
