# Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos on the Future of Entertainment | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8)
*  So I was going to start with asking for your outlook on streaming and entertainment in general. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean Netflix released its Q3 earnings last week and it's safe to say they were extremely positive [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=7.0s)]
*  and off the back of that the Wall Street Journal described Netflix as the most investable name in a troubled media market. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=14.0s)]
*  So you know things are looking good for Netflix but the market is undoubtedly troubled. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=21.0s)]
*  So my question is how do you see the future of streaming in this troubled market? What might it look like in five years from now? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=27.0s)]
*  I think the entertainment landscape is not troubled. I think the way that people consume it has become disintermediated, it's been disaggregated. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=33.0s)]
*  I think people are doing it in a bunch of different ways and they're favoring things that favor the consumer, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=43.0s)]
*  which I think does play into our strength as a company. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=48.0s)]
*  Early on and from the beginning of time we've always moved into kind of consumer first approach to doing business. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=51.0s)]
*  So when people, I always think around the roots of watching entertainment at home, television of course, very limited selection. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=60.0s)]
*  For many, many years there were just three, then eventually four networks to choose from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=68.0s)]
*  and they barely competed with each other for eyeballs and attention with basically the same things to watch. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=73.0s)]
*  Home video comes along super inconvenient. You had to get in the car and drive each way to the video store to get your movie [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=79.0s)]
*  and the movie you wanted is out of stock so you get the second choice or the third choice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=86.0s)]
*  So we were solving for it, we were trying to solve for a lot of problems with a vision that Rectory Reed Hastings told me in 1999 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=90.0s)]
*  was that eventually all home entertainment is going to come into the home on the Internet. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=99.0s)]
*  And I said that, by the way, at that time no entertainment came into the home on the Internet [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=104.0s)]
*  and it was a huge big vision, it could have been perceived as a crazy one, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=110.0s)]
*  but what we saw was the power of the Internet for convenience, for choice, for control, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=114.0s)]
*  all things that were very human appealing were going to benefit entertainment greatly. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=120.0s)]
*  And that was always the vision for the business was to be a digital entertainment business, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=125.0s)]
*  a global digital entertainment business with lots of choice and lots of selection, lots of freedom, all the things that we offer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=131.0s)]
*  And entertainment, I think, as other companies have tried to migrate into what we do, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=137.0s)]
*  they still have their roots in old legacy media models that they're trying to support. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=142.0s)]
*  Linear television that is not at your control, that is not at your timetable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=149.0s)]
*  The very specifically narrow choices of things to watch, where we kind of, you know, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=154.0s)]
*  can be very broad and have a big variety and quality of programming at a remarkably low price [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=160.0s)]
*  and in a UI that you can find the things you love. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=165.0s)]
*  So I don't think entertainment is in trouble and I think that consumers are speaking loud and clear that they prefer streaming. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=168.0s)]
*  Yeah. So obviously you had these great results, but two years ago things weren't looking quite so good for Netflix. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=175.0s)]
*  There were some questions around profitability and your ability to keep growing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=181.0s)]
*  What did that moment feel like for you in the company? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=185.0s)]
*  So for me, I'm coming up on 25 years at Netflix. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=188.0s)]
*  So the things that are happening are never as bad as they seem and nor are they ever as good as they seem. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=191.0s)]
*  So we keep a pretty level head about ourselves. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=199.0s)]
*  And we were we knew that the business fundamentals were sound. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=202.0s)]
*  COVID kind of threw the rhythms off a little bit, but that the business fundamentals were sound. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=206.0s)]
*  And we kept betting on, you know, the core business and the core business fundamentals. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=211.0s)]
*  So it felt a bit lousy and we had an enormous drop in the market cap of the business. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=215.0s)]
*  But again, we were looking at it thinking, well, there's nothing that's happening in our business that would reflect that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=220.0s)]
*  So let's just stay the course. Let's just stay the course. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=226.0s)]
*  So one thing you're not having to worry about at the moment, which you were having to worry about before, was the writer's strike. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=229.0s)]
*  And I wonder, what did you learn from that writer's strike? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=235.0s)]
*  I mean, am I right in thinking that obviously a lot less content was created at the time? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=238.0s)]
*  And that remains the case today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=242.0s)]
*  But yet your customers are still sticking around. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=244.0s)]
*  So what did you learn from that from that pause in production? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, we have a lot of programming, which is again, we're because we're making trying to make something for everyone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=249.0s)]
*  One way that gets interpreted as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=254.0s)]
*  It's a lot of stuff and it is a lot of programming. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=256.0s)]
*  So relative to other people, we had a lot of things in the pipeline to keep things going. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=258.0s)]
*  But it definitely had an interruption in our output this year. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=263.0s)]
*  So there's kind of a delayed impact on it because the things that were in production were stalled. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=267.0s)]
*  Our film slate was stalled. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=271.0s)]
*  And some of our biggest returning shows got pushed out into those back parts of the year. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=273.0s)]
*  We were talking about Nobody Wants This. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=279.0s)]
*  That show was supposed to come out earlier in the first part of the year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=281.0s)]
*  It came out in the very back half. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=284.0s)]
*  Managed to get Bridgerton in there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=285.0s)]
*  It was about the only big one that we'd planned for the beginning of the year. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=287.0s)]
*  And everything else got pushed out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=290.0s)]
*  But people found things to watch. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=291.0s)]
*  But I don't take any comfort from that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=294.0s)]
*  I do think there's really it's very important that are all the studios and the and labor all the considers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=296.0s)]
*  They have to speak all the time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=302.0s)]
*  We have to have healthy working relationships together. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=304.0s)]
*  So it's we hope that we'll never see something like that happen again. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=307.0s)]
*  But I think it's really important that we talk on an ongoing basis, not just when the contracts come up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=311.0s)]
*  Did you end up making more stuff overseas? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=317.0s)]
*  I mean, did you have you hedged your bets by moving more production? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=319.0s)]
*  Well, we have more than half of our business is overseas. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=322.0s)]
*  So we make a lot of original we produce original content in 50 countries. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=326.0s)]
*  And those shows are not only incredibly relevant. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=330.0s)]
*  In fact, the mandate of those is that they are incredibly relevant in the country they're made for. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=333.0s)]
*  And if they happen to travel, that's a windfall. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=337.0s)]
*  And sometimes like a squid game, it's a huge windfall in that the whole world fell in love with that show. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=340.0s)]
*  And it was probably the only thing Wednesday and Squid Game are the two most global shows we've ever had, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=345.0s)]
*  where as many people in India watched it as people watch it in Indiana in Indiana. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=350.0s)]
*  And they just really love this show in a really global way. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=355.0s)]
*  But neither of them was engineered to be global in any way. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=358.0s)]
*  So it's so sort of one. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=361.0s)]
*  So we didn't do a lot of international production. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=363.0s)]
*  But there's still this element of surprise that can even in spite of all the algorithms and the sort of close attention you pay to data, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=365.0s)]
*  sometimes something will catch you off of catch you like that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=371.0s)]
*  I mean, apart from Squid Game, have there been any other shows that have come out of the blue and sort of mean just to follow what you said? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=375.0s)]
*  I think that the squid game is a fun example because there's something incredibly human about having a hard time predicting something bigger than you've ever seen before. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=380.0s)]
*  So when I asked the teams to predict how big will this be? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=392.0s)]
*  Usually the biggest thing they could say will be as it'll be as big as the last big thing we had. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=396.0s)]
*  Nobody predicted this good game was going to be twice as big as anybody had ever seen before. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=401.0s)]
*  And nobody had predicted because no one was trying to make it a global show that it would catch on the way it did. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=406.0s)]
*  And our advantage of that was it had a it had some very universal messages in it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=411.0s)]
*  It was because it was so specifically local, it was so uniquely and authentically Korean that people like that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=416.0s)]
*  They see they see something else in it and it reminds them, I think, of how small the world is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=423.0s)]
*  So when you do it right, it's that thing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=428.0s)]
*  But I actually think that when people predict how big something might be, they are limited by how big they've ever seen. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=430.0s)]
*  So the idea of doing something that no one's ever seen before or something bigger than anyone's ever seen before is very hard for us all to pull off with all the data in the world. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=438.0s)]
*  And sometimes it's the other way around. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=446.0s)]
*  You think, oh, my God, this is all the sum of the parts here is pretty great. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=448.0s)]
*  And then people just didn't like how they came together and it just didn't work. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=451.0s)]
*  So it's it's still a very creative process. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=454.0s)]
*  That's the idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=456.0s)]
*  So I've got to ask you about generative AI. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=458.0s)]
*  Is Netflix using generative AI at the moment? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=462.0s)]
*  And if so, how? So I look at Gen AI as a tool for creators to create content, not for Netflix to create instead of creators. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=465.0s)]
*  And I think if it's a tool that helps creators make better programming, which is our core focus every day, day in, day out, can we make the show a little bit better? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=474.0s)]
*  Can we make the movie a little bit better? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=483.0s)]
*  That people will people love this more if it has this, this or this that's really in the hands of creators. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=484.0s)]
*  And we try to enable them. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=489.0s)]
*  And that with Gen AI tools are exactly the same. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=491.0s)]
*  So I feel like there are opportunities if it passes the big test, which is can this use of this tool make a better show? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=494.0s)]
*  Then it will be really transformative and be helpful. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=503.0s)]
*  But if it doesn't, it's just going to I think it's going to be part of somewhere in the hype cycle of what it is right now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=506.0s)]
*  Would Netflix ever consider buying a Gen a licensing deal with a Gen AI company to use in production? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=512.0s)]
*  Again, it's it's a there's a series of tools that I think will be built on top of all that the people will use that will probably be helpful to help creators do better work. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=520.0s)]
*  I don't see us doing the work in that way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=530.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be a great investment for us because I think they'll be those tools will be widely available. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=533.0s)]
*  So you don't think it's going to materially change the experience of watching Netflix say five years from now won't be very. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=537.0s)]
*  Or do you think it will be different? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=543.0s)]
*  Again, I don't mean I think it'd be very helpful in the UI and choosing all those kind of things. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=545.0s)]
*  It'll have a profound impact on helping people find things and all those things. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=550.0s)]
*  The Internet will be moved by that artificial. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=554.0s)]
*  Gen AI to help things that are already working work better. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=558.0s)]
*  So I think that includes choosing and merchandising and UI creation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=562.0s)]
*  So the idea is always trying to figure out when you've got an enormous selection of things to pick from. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=567.0s)]
*  It's really hard to pick. Like, what do you want to watch? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=572.0s)]
*  What do you want to watch tonight? Because that may be completely different than what you wanted to watch last night or yesterday. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=574.0s)]
*  And so there's a whole I think AI will be very helpful in in helping people find things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=579.0s)]
*  So you have a lot of cash on your balance sheet at the moment. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=585.0s)]
*  Have you are you would you consider any other types of acquisitions, studios or are there things out there that you'd like to go shopping for? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=588.0s)]
*  So we've mostly been builders instead of buyers to get to this point. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=598.0s)]
*  The few acquisitions we've done are mostly been in the kind of IP arena, things that we can produce from. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=602.0s)]
*  I don't see us being out there. I think there's still so much room to grow here in the core core business. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=609.0s)]
*  Entertainment, professional films, television, games and now advertising as well that we've got a lot of room to grow what we're doing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=614.0s)]
*  And we've been pretty good at building it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=624.0s)]
*  And every once in a while, tactically, we'll buy some things here and there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=626.0s)]
*  But for the most part, I wouldn't anticipate that the change dramatically. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=628.0s)]
*  So I want to ask you about all these different bits that you're trying out. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=631.0s)]
*  But first of all, advertising, you mentioned it then. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=635.0s)]
*  It's not a huge I mean, you're sort of it's not a huge part of the business yet, is it? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=638.0s)]
*  But this new advertising tier, how important do you think that's going to be in the future for Netflix? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=642.0s)]
*  It's what kind of role will it be? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=648.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, like any big business, new things have got to have to do a lot to to make a big dent or to be very impactful. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=651.0s)]
*  So it will grow slowly over the next couple of years. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=658.0s)]
*  We're seeing we're happy to see where it's how it's growing to date. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=662.0s)]
*  The team has been doing a great job of like, you know, kind of doubling our upfront commitments from year on year. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=665.0s)]
*  We're getting we're really happy with the milestones we've hit so far. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=671.0s)]
*  All that being said, we're building our ad teams from scratch, our sales teams from scratch. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=675.0s)]
*  We're building new ad tech from scratch and we're getting that all ramped up right now. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=680.0s)]
*  And what's comforting is we have about 40 million users on the ad tier now and growing pretty quickly. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=684.0s)]
*  And and I feel like the proven business model of video advertising and advertising on video content is out there. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=691.0s)]
*  And that's all we have to do is be really good at all the things to get there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=699.0s)]
*  So and I think the core it's right at our sweet spot is engagement. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=702.0s)]
*  We want the programming that people care about. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=706.0s)]
*  People want to watch it. Advertisers want to be close to it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=709.0s)]
*  So I think we do all those things well. We'll be we'll compete really well in that space. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=712.0s)]
*  I don't think it's something we're trying to prove a new theory here that people will watch advertising and video content. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=716.0s)]
*  And I think for us, having an ad tier at all is just a way of opening up a larger, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=722.0s)]
*  total adjustable market of folks who don't mind advertising and want a lower price. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=729.0s)]
*  So I just think it's just it expands the total market. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=734.0s)]
*  So talking of lower price, it's interesting when I when I told people I was going to be for you, they asked they asked two things. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=737.0s)]
*  First of all, they say, ask him what to watch next. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=744.0s)]
*  You can get to and then they say and tell him not to put up the subscription price. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=746.0s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how much how much how much how much higher can you go? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=750.0s)]
*  How much more will the U.S. consumer or global consumer for that matter tolerate when it comes to the subscription fee? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=755.0s)]
*  Yeah, I honestly think we've always had it's a value equation. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=762.0s)]
*  So the more time you spend watching Netflix, the more the more you value the things you watch on Netflix, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=766.0s)]
*  that it's in direct correlation to how much you can charge for Netflix. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=771.0s)]
*  And we have a very instant feedback model with consumers where one click cancel. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=775.0s)]
*  If you don't think it's valuable to you at that price point, you just click one button and you're off. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=779.0s)]
*  So we are constantly in search of pleasing our members more and more and adding more and more value. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=784.0s)]
*  And every once in a while, we come back to them and ask for an increase so that we can keep that cycle going. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=790.0s)]
*  But I don't think we can do it unless we continue to add to the value. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=794.0s)]
*  So we've had a pretty good track record of doing that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=798.0s)]
*  We're we're growing our engagement. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=801.0s)]
*  We there's a published number of all the engagement. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=803.0s)]
*  And they have to remember that when we started doing the password enforcement, we took fewer people on each account. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=806.0s)]
*  So if you look at just the member households, that engagement is growing much faster than the total engagement, which is a good thing. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=812.0s)]
*  That's the normalized for the password behavior. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=817.0s)]
*  And that's a really good test, I think, because I think if people are watching and enjoying Netflix, they're happy to pay a little bit for it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=820.0s)]
*  So you always talk very engagingly about engagement. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=827.0s)]
*  I know it's your key thing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=831.0s)]
*  And it's absolutely key. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=833.0s)]
*  But it's really interesting. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=835.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=836.0s)]
*  So you credit your success with this almost Maoist like focus on engagement. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=837.0s)]
*  What what does what does a entertainment that doesn't focus on engagement look like? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=842.0s)]
*  I mean, because not everybody is as as focused as you are. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=847.0s)]
*  What is it? What is what does it look like to not be purely focused? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=850.0s)]
*  Look, I think we were born direct to consumer. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=853.0s)]
*  So all of our business was always going right to the consumer with an instant feedback model. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=856.0s)]
*  So we've always been focused on that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=862.0s)]
*  Like, you know, how do we are you happy? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=864.0s)]
*  Are you happy with what we're providing you? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=866.0s)]
*  A lot of other businesses, particularly in the entertainment space, are all kind of B2B businesses that don't really have to focus on real measurable enjoyment. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=868.0s)]
*  Movie theaters are the kind of go between between the studio and the consumer and the ticket buyers. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=878.0s)]
*  Cable operators between the producers of content and the ultimate consumer. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=884.0s)]
*  And this is actually us making the content for the consumer and them telling us if they love it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=889.0s)]
*  And if they are, if they do love it, they stick around. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=894.0s)]
*  And I have found that no better measurement of joy has been better than engagement because I've never seen anybody turn off a show that they love unless they just have to go to bed and they're going to watch more tomorrow. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=897.0s)]
*  And I've never seen one stick around for a show that they hate. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=908.0s)]
*  Now, I go to the movie theaters. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=911.0s)]
*  I've seen a lot of movies that I don't like. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=914.0s)]
*  I've never walked out. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=916.0s)]
*  I've never physically walked out. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=918.0s)]
*  I don't think you probably have seen that many people walk out. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=920.0s)]
*  I guess that maybe it happens sometimes. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=923.0s)]
*  It becomes a meme if it does. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=925.0s)]
*  But I think but I so I but I do think in this model, streaming has kind of raised the bar on television and movies in a really remarkable way. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=927.0s)]
*  Because when we release a new movie, we release a new TV show. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=936.0s)]
*  It's now competing with everything ever made ever. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=939.0s)]
*  And you with one click of the button, no switching costs. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=943.0s)]
*  You can just turn off this new thing and watch this other thing. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=945.0s)]
*  So for me, it's like that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=949.0s)]
*  That's why we measure the engagement. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=951.0s)]
*  That's why we look at how people how engaged people are from episode to episode. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=953.0s)]
*  Do they finish the series that they started? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=957.0s)]
*  Do they finish the movie that they push play on? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=959.0s)]
*  All those things are the things that matter most to us. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=962.0s)]
*  And that's why we're so hyper engaged in it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=964.0s)]
*  And again, I don't know what these other models might liquid that they charge and don't get engagement. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=966.0s)]
*  I don't know how you it's but it feels like a hack versus a business. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=970.0s)]
*  So talking of everything ever made ever, obviously the next generation of spending more time on YouTube, TikTok, as we all know, you know, are you I mean, they are going to be your future audiences. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=975.0s)]
*  Yeah. But do you feel like you need to be playing in that space as well? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=988.0s)]
*  Getting getting to where they are or are you just going to wait for them to mature and come to you? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=992.0s)]
*  Look, in some ways, it's going to be a training ground for storytellers and creators, which is great. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=997.0s)]
*  In other ways, it's a way that people kill time. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1003.0s)]
*  I do think killing time and spending time are two different activities. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1005.0s)]
*  And you can be careful not to get too distracted by chasing everything that people are doing. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1009.0s)]
*  I think that a lot of what's happening on social media and and through user generated is it's interesting and exciting. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1015.0s)]
*  And I look at the monetization model. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1022.0s)]
*  It isn't possible to do something at the scope and scale that we do on Netflix through that model. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1024.0s)]
*  This doesn't monetize well enough to do that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1031.0s)]
*  And the creators have to go to put up all their own money to do that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1033.0s)]
*  So I think it's the model itself is self limiting and what the content can be. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1037.0s)]
*  So they are we're in two different arenas in terms of programming in that way. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1041.0s)]
*  But it is a way that people spend time on TV. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1044.0s)]
*  So I do pay attention to it, of course. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1046.0s)]
*  What about video games? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1048.0s)]
*  Because you've also got into mobile video games, which is perhaps something that not all your subscribers are aware of. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1050.0s)]
*  Are you expecting to make that part of your core growth? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1056.0s)]
*  Yeah, I look again back to the you know, what are people doing? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1059.0s)]
*  You know, how do they what are they looking to for entertainment? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1062.0s)]
*  And if you look at movies and television and advertising, supported content and games, it's about a six hundred billion dollar consumer spend. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1065.0s)]
*  And, you know, today we get about five or six percent of that and engagement time on the TV of all those things. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1073.0s)]
*  In the U.S., we get about 10 percent of that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1080.0s)]
*  The rest of the world, much smaller. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1083.0s)]
*  So tons of room to grow in that and games we were not really part being part of it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1085.0s)]
*  So I think for me, it's a little bit about how do people spend time and energy and entertainment time and energy playing games? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1089.0s)]
*  And how can that actually complement what's happening on Netflix? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1097.0s)]
*  So our most successful games to date, and it's a small thing, but it's growing, have been big games based on our IP, like too hot to handle and love is blind. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1100.0s)]
*  And I think there's a world where you can build a gaming universe that's within the storytelling universe of a show like Outer Banks and that people will in between seasons will spend time in that world. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1110.0s)]
*  And for super fans, you may even be able to spin up storylines and introduce new characters and all that through a game. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1122.0s)]
*  So it becomes part of more interchangeable with how people are watching programming. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1129.0s)]
*  It's a better version of interactive television than we've done before. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1133.0s)]
*  So I also want to ask you about sport. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1136.0s)]
*  So traditionally, Netflix has done some great sports documentaries, Drive to Survive, the like, but you haven't really been into live sports streaming. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1139.0s)]
*  However, Christmas Day, no less, you're going to be streaming two NFL games live and you're also going to be streaming a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1150.0s)]
*  So I suppose my question is, will we ever see a full season of college or professional football, baseball, basketball on Netflix? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1160.0s)]
*  I'll never say never, but I would say that right now we are in the live events business. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1169.0s)]
*  Some of those events are sports. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1174.0s)]
*  So the Tom Brady, to me, the Tom Brady roast is as much alive as a live event as the Tyson Paul fight. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1176.0s)]
*  So it's just a way that people are something very interesting and very exciting about when the world comes together to watch the same thing at the same time. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1183.0s)]
*  They don't do it very often. That's what makes it so special. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1190.0s)]
*  And I don't know that for us. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1193.0s)]
*  So I think what's special about Christmas Day football is we've two games on Christmas Day. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1195.0s)]
*  We're going to, you know, I think we add a lot of value to the league in terms of making those games more international with our large footprint, with 600 million users of Netflix around the world every day. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1200.0s)]
*  We've got we're going to do a lot to make it fun. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1211.0s)]
*  It'll be aware that it's Christmas Day. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1214.0s)]
*  So it's going to be super entertaining. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1216.0s)]
*  It's been a different kind of a fun event of presenting football. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1218.0s)]
*  But I think if you did it every two days a week and three days a week, it'd be a little less exciting. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1222.0s)]
*  Now along those lines, we do have WWE coming next year that will be live every week. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1227.0s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1231.0s)]
*  The most part for me, the reason the difference between the event and the full season is really the economics. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1233.0s)]
*  And I think the leagues do a phenomenal job of building fandom. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1239.0s)]
*  And for that, they get to keep all the all the money and distributions, pretty low margin business in league sports, you know, for full season league sports. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1243.0s)]
*  I do think if we can add some value back to them, which I think we do uniquely, we can make that work. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1252.0s)]
*  So as a quick aside here, I've my sports columnist has wants me to ask you something and he'll kill me if I don't. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1258.0s)]
*  He wants to know whether you're more worried about Jake Paul or Mike Tyson. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1265.0s)]
*  I have no idea how to call this fight. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1271.0s)]
*  It's it's it's going to be incredibly entertaining. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1273.0s)]
*  And that's what we try to do day in and day out. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1276.0s)]
*  So that's all I know for sure. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1278.0s)]
*  So another departure for Netflix is again is in live experiences. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1280.0s)]
*  So you've apparently set up launched Netflix Netflix House in King of Prussia. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1285.0s)]
*  I mean, I was just amazed to find out that in America called King of Prussia. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1293.0s)]
*  But anyway, you've now got a Netflix house at this place and also one in Dallas, I think. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1297.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're under construction now that I'd open. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah. And are they are they an attempt to sort of take on Disney or is this more of a kind of marketing ploy? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1304.0s)]
*  It's not an attempt to take on Disney without really. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1310.0s)]
*  I don't think it competes with Disneyland. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1313.0s)]
*  Mostly what it is is a way what we found is we've launched like 50 of these live experiences around the world all over the world. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1315.0s)]
*  Things like the Bridgerton ball where people come in full costume on their own and go to a three hour dance and are judged by the Queen. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1322.0s)]
*  And it's like it's very fun and it's very popular. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1332.0s)]
*  We've had like seven marriage proposals at Bridgerton balls around the world. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1334.0s)]
*  We kind of started it with during Covid. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1338.0s)]
*  We did a stranger things drive through experience where we took over an empty parking lot during Covid. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1341.0s)]
*  People drove through it. It's hugely popular. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1346.0s)]
*  And we'd have the squid game challenge squeaking trials at the you know, that is in there all there. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1349.0s)]
*  Anyway, they they but they pick up and travel. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1356.0s)]
*  So you spend so much time and energy and money on the setting them up and breaking them down. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1359.0s)]
*  This is a way to bring some scale to this thing that consumers really love, which is to put themselves into these storytelling worlds and share them on their social media and just have a really great experience out. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1364.0s)]
*  We this will be kind of the best of everything we've learned from our live experiences, including Netflix Bites, which was a restaurant experience we did in L.A. last year. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1375.0s)]
*  So they'll all have a food component with all of our food brands. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1384.0s)]
*  They'll have ticketed experiences. They'll have, you know, live, you know, more immersive retail experiences. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1387.0s)]
*  They're both like 100000 square foot facilities, one in Dallas, one in in King of Prussia and meant to be mostly a learning experience of how we can make this travel. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1394.0s)]
*  I would love to see that I don't. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1403.0s)]
*  While I don't see us having a park, I do see that we could have 50 or 60 of these around the world and people would visit them a lot more frequently than they visit. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1405.0s)]
*  So definitely part of a real growth area for you then. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1412.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think the core is not a relative to the core business. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1416.0s)]
*  I think it's it complements the core business because, you know, it's you look at it even consumer products and all the across all the studios. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1420.0s)]
*  It's part of it's part marketing. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1428.0s)]
*  It's part business. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1430.0s)]
*  It's it's much more important for me that it's big than it is that it's wildly profitable because the big is a reflection of the cultural impact of the storytelling. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1431.0s)]
*  So I want to talk a bit about Netflix culture because obviously you're famously Netflix has got this very distinct culture that's been credited with being able to attract talent and keep create this real kind of sort of environment of excellence. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1441.0s)]
*  Now, but this year you've you've you've updated your culture memo. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1457.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1462.0s)]
*  And I think I'm right in thinking that you've ditched the freedom and responsibility section of the memo and talking more now about employing unusually responsible people. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1463.0s)]
*  And you've also got rid of the language saying you don't want to employ brilliant jerks. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1475.0s)]
*  So does that mean that there's now room for brilliant jerks at Netflix? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1480.0s)]
*  So the reflection of the update of the document, we a little history of that document we started doing it years ago. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1485.0s)]
*  Reid, the company was pretty small. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1493.0s)]
*  We had probably I bet we didn't have 300 employees. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1494.0s)]
*  We started writing the culture memo. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1497.0s)]
*  It was interesting back to that first meeting with Reid in 1989. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1500.0s)]
*  Reid was talking about all those concepts that are in the original culture memo. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1503.0s)]
*  And I thought, wow, we barely have people here. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1508.0s)]
*  You're talking about a culture. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1511.0s)]
*  But he was looking very long range and how the what this business was going to be. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1512.0s)]
*  And it was perfectly suited for a couple hundred employees. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1516.0s)]
*  And when you had basically so few that you could go through it with them every once a month, we'd actually go through it with a new with new hires. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1520.0s)]
*  That's what really what the document was for. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1527.0s)]
*  And then Reid had to get again the big insight, which was, you know, we should publish this thing. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1529.0s)]
*  So instead of hiring people, then telling what we believe, why don't we tell people to believe and see if they want to work here? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1534.0s)]
*  And so he just literally one day pushed a button and put the culture memo on the Internet. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1539.0s)]
*  And it you know, Sheryl Sandberg said it's the most important document in the history of the Internet. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1543.0s)]
*  So so I do think it was one of those things where we didn't take lightly the evolution of the document. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1547.0s)]
*  But it actually reflects much more today. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1552.0s)]
*  Our 14000 employee business culture and the freedom responsibility evolution wasn't we didn't throw it out. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1556.0s)]
*  We just it was probably a little too more emphasis on freedom than responsibility. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1563.0s)]
*  And we think you have to have both. So it's ways of re recrafting some of those things. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1567.0s)]
*  But the core values in the new document are all in the old document. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1571.0s)]
*  Right. Did you get did you get any pushback from from the update? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1575.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because it's such an iconic thing. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1579.0s)]
*  We got you get a little bit. And I do think one thing that we have to really help employees understand all the time is that we have we put no energy in preserving the culture. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1582.0s)]
*  We are constantly working on improving the culture. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1591.0s)]
*  And so when anyone says, hey, the culture is changing. Yes, of course, it needs to. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1594.0s)]
*  Yeah, we definitely change the culture. We want to reflect how we work, not dictate how we work. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1598.0s)]
*  And did you update the famous keeper test as well? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1602.0s)]
*  Or is that does that it's in there. It's still in there. Yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1605.0s)]
*  Still still rigidly applied. Yeah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1608.0s)]
*  And I think it's helpful. I mean, honestly, I feel like it's one of those things where it was a good insight, which is, you know, this is we're looking for the best and brightest. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1611.0s)]
*  And we wanted a lot of people. Some people choose in and out of the culture, too. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1619.0s)]
*  We don't just choose in and out of them. And it's not it is often written about as being this kind of cold and cutthroat thing. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1623.0s)]
*  And it's really not. It's just are we constantly saying, are we are we happy with each other and being able to be candid with each other and ask the hard question. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1629.0s)]
*  So another distinctive feature of Netflix culture is this co CEO model. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1637.0s)]
*  You are co CEO previously with Reed Hastings, now with Greg Peters. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1643.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk this week about succession CEO at Disney. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1648.0s)]
*  Yeah, is the co CEO model one that you would recommend to Disney? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1653.0s)]
*  It's hard for me to recommend the program to another company where I don't really understand their business and turn their business culture. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1658.0s)]
*  I understand their business pretty well, but not their business culture. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1666.0s)]
*  It works really well for Netflix for all the reasons that that culture document is so important for the reasons that that exists. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1668.0s)]
*  The reason that the evolution to co CEO that that this goes back to I'm going to go back to 1999 again. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1675.0s)]
*  Reed told me he was going to create a company that was going to be around way after him. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1681.0s)]
*  So succession was on his mind in 1999. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1686.0s)]
*  And I think it was on his mind 10 years ago when he and I started more running the business together. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1689.0s)]
*  And I think it was on his mind, you know, three or five, maybe five years ago when we officially named me co CEO. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1697.0s)]
*  And I think in the evolution of Reed becoming our executive chair, he we had the time to prove out the model that for this company, for Netflix, the co CEO model works uniquely well. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1704.0s)]
*  We've got two very distinctly different things that we have to accomplish. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1715.0s)]
*  One is in the technology of the delivery and the UI and all the cost of the product enhancements that has to happen. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1719.0s)]
*  And then this kind of creative culture that has to pick and create the programming for the world and the creative culture and the technical and the tech cultures are different. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1726.0s)]
*  And if you and we knew that coming in, we knew that early on my I never office in Silicon Valley when I joined Netflix. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1736.0s)]
*  I was the first and first employee in Southern California. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1744.0s)]
*  My office was in the bed, my bedroom in Palos Verdes. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1747.0s)]
*  And I used to eventually and I used to commute up to Los Carlos a couple of days a week and eventually realizing that I really got to intimately know that, you know, the tech culture as well and how they could work together and how they were not very complimentary of each other in some other ways. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1750.0s)]
*  So I want what I said, we need to build a company where our tech employees feel like they work at the greatest tech company in the world. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1767.0s)]
*  And our student our creative employees need to feel like they work at the best entertainment company in the world. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1773.0s)]
*  And they both have to be true. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1778.0s)]
*  So we've always run the business that way. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1780.0s)]
*  So co CEO worked really well for us where we could focus on core deliverables. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1782.0s)]
*  Just like me and read Greg and I have got incredible mutual respect for each other. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1787.0s)]
*  We like each other. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1791.0s)]
*  We like working with each other. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1792.0s)]
*  We have skill sets that are complimentary. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1794.0s)]
*  And I feel like there is this goofy phrase. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1796.0s)]
*  You know, it's lonely at the top. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1801.0s)]
*  There is something really unique about having someone that you can have as a sounding board that isn't your employee that isn't a board member to just to work on new things and new ideas. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1802.0s)]
*  And so I find it to be a really incredible model for us. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1813.0s)]
*  I don't know that it works everywhere. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1817.0s)]
*  If you've if you know if your business culture is more politically charged than ours is it might not go so well. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1818.0s)]
*  You know, there were there were three co emperors in the Roman Empire. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1824.0s)]
*  None of them went very well. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1827.0s)]
*  But I mean, would you take a call from James Gorman if he was to ring you about the Disney CEO job? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1828.0s)]
*  Not even on my mind. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1837.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1839.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1841.0s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1842.0s)]
*  Honestly, I think what we're doing is so exciting. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1848.0s)]
*  And again, we're it feels like, you know, at 10 percent of TV engagement, it feels so small. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1852.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1858.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, what's it feel like to get to 15 to get to 20? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1859.0s)]
*  Can we do that? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1863.0s)]
*  You know, when we were at two, four percent seemed impossible. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1864.0s)]
*  You know, so I feel like when I look at all these different these different milestones, our first million subscribers, we had a party for a million subscribers. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1868.0s)]
*  We got to millions of subscribers. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1875.0s)]
*  You know, there are two hundred eighty two million subscribers around the world now. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1877.0s)]
*  And I feel like the business has evolved. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1880.0s)]
*  The people we've gotten to the place where, you know, we're doing we're not just exporting Hollywood content around the world. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1882.0s)]
*  So it's not like we're doing a different a better version of something else. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1889.0s)]
*  We're doing something that's really never been done before. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1892.0s)]
*  So that's that's endlessly exciting. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1895.0s)]
*  But OK, so if not next year of Disney, what I mean, you've been hugely successful. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1897.0s)]
*  You've been at Netflix now for 28. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1903.0s)]
*  Twenty five years, twenty five years. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1905.0s)]
*  What do you ever think about what you might do next? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1907.0s)]
*  You know, is there some sort of public service role or, I don't know, run for office? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1910.0s)]
*  What what what might what might the next chapter look like for? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1915.0s)]
*  I always say never say never. I'm never going to run for office. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1918.0s)]
*  But I would say that I feel like I don't know because I'm so energized every day about what we're doing. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1922.0s)]
*  And I know that sounds crazy after 25 years, but every couple of years it feels like we're doing something completely different. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1927.0s)]
*  I mean, from the evolution of mailing DVDs around the U.S. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1933.0s)]
*  And when I joined Netflix, my job was to go buy the DVDs at Best Buy and Walmart and Costco, wherever we can find them. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1936.0s)]
*  And to and I'm going from that to what we're doing today. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1945.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's remarkable that it's not going to anyone get tired or bored. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1949.0s)]
*  But we're going we're looking at that evolution and a very few companies have been able to make those evolutions. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1953.0s)]
*  So like you'll forget it went from domestic only DVD by mail to we were actually even transactional at the beginning. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1959.0s)]
*  So transactional subscription to digital, which we always thought was going to be the business. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1967.0s)]
*  We named it Netflix, not DVD flicks for a reason. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1972.0s)]
*  And and then to kind of getting into original production. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1976.0s)]
*  All these things feel like incredible leaps. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1979.0s)]
*  And we've done them every couple of years. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1981.0s)]
*  And I just feel like it leaves the possibility of what what is the next exciting jump going to look like and feel like pretty hard to predict right now. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1983.0s)]
*  But it's going to but if it's anything like the last few, it's going to be amazing. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1990.0s)]
*  Good. OK, well, look, we haven't got much time, but I'll take a question from the audience. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=1994.0s)]
*  There's one over here. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2000.0s)]
*  You got a microphone coming. Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2006.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2008.0s)]
*  Anyone on the managerial side, the business side of your company that's joined in the last few years has only known Netflix as a market leader. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2012.0s)]
*  You know, and obviously that's not true for you. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2024.0s)]
*  You know, going to Best Buy. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2029.0s)]
*  So I was wondering if you could reflect a little bit, please, on how it feels to be a market leader. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2032.0s)]
*  You know, the fruits of your labor in terms of being able to kind of throw your weight around to shape an industry for the benefit of consumers and also just from an organizational evolution perspective. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2038.0s)]
*  If you could talk a little bit about how your leadership team learned to thrive as an incumbent, thrive as a market leader. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2052.0s)]
*  How much of that is like Netflix lifers learning those skills versus like alloying your leadership team with people who come from other leadership positions? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2061.0s)]
*  Look, I think there's something about humility that we try to instill in all of our leaders. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2073.0s)]
*  Like I said, many of them, you're right, the ones that have just joined recently had not been around for Quickster or some of those other big trips in the business. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2080.0s)]
*  But we've always looked at it. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2089.0s)]
*  I remember early on having a conversation with the leadership team about my kids are 28 and 30. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2091.0s)]
*  And when you're very young, I think you think about life is just like this. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2097.0s)]
*  I get older and smarter and richer and get married and have kids and do all these things. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2101.0s)]
*  Like at a pretty linear, you know, up and to the right. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2106.0s)]
*  Life is always up and to the right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2108.0s)]
*  But then when you actually look back on it, it's a series of incredible highs and lows. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2109.0s)]
*  And that we should treat the business that way, too, which is we expect there to be incredible highs and lows in the business. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2113.0s)]
*  That when you pull way back, it's going to look like this if you do it all right. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2119.0s)]
*  But you're going to have lows in the business. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2124.0s)]
*  You got to be ready for that. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2125.0s)]
*  And you've got to be willing to take hearts, make hard sacrifices for the long term business. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2127.0s)]
*  And if you're petrified of those dips, you'll never do those things. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2131.0s)]
*  So that's the thing we try to kind of condition people to do. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2135.0s)]
*  Fight for that thing that's going to get us there in the end and win in the end and be ready for the fact that, you know, failing is not the end of the world. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2138.0s)]
*  You learn a bunch from it and move on. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2145.0s)]
*  Don't make the same mistake a thousand times, but go ahead and make a thousand mistakes and we'll and we'll be fine. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2147.0s)]
*  And remember, I think when we hire people out of the entertainment industry, the entertainment industry is mostly a fear culture, you know, where people would be fired for making a bad choice of a show or, you know, whatever, however it went. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2152.0s)]
*  And I really look at it and say, well, what did we learn from that show that didn't work or that movie that didn't work? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2164.0s)]
*  And let's not do that again versus this other thing, which is like every decision is life or death. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2168.0s)]
*  And if I don't, you know, if I don't do this right, you know, I'm going to get fired. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2173.0s)]
*  Someone's head's got to be on the block for this. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2177.0s)]
*  So we didn't we intentionally did not go down that path. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2179.0s)]
*  Probably a lot of influence from the tech from tech side of the business, which is a lot of iteration. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2182.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2187.0s)]
*  So you can launch software and then keep iterating on it forever. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2188.0s)]
*  You make a movie once you once you've locked the cut. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2191.0s)]
*  That's the movie. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2193.0s)]
*  So things are quite different. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2194.0s)]
*  But we try to figure out how do you learn the best of both of those. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2196.0s)]
*  OK, Ted, we're out of time. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2199.0s)]
*  So I'm going to wrap up with two questions. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2201.0s)]
*  Firstly, what's the one series that Netflix didn't make that you wish you had made? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2203.0s)]
*  Oh, you love that question. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2208.0s)]
*  I do. It's useful. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2210.0s)]
*  There's honestly there's a bunch of them. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2212.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2214.0s)]
*  I would think that for me that there's you can't there's no like monopoly on storytelling. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2215.0s)]
*  Someone's going to have a good idea. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2221.0s)]
*  Someone's going to have someone's going to see something that you didn't. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2222.0s)]
*  And then a lot of times a pitch will come in and the show that ultimately comes out is nothing like the pitch that came in. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2225.0s)]
*  So either sometimes the one that you greenlit or the one that you passed on. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2231.0s)]
*  And so I look at things that you know that went there. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2235.0s)]
*  I wish we had every show that was successful somewhere else. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2237.0s)]
*  And I think in that along those lines for me personally, I love the bear. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2240.0s)]
*  I love watching the bear. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2244.0s)]
*  I wish it was I wish that was one of ours. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2245.0s)]
*  I do think like things like Ted Lassow is super important. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2248.0s)]
*  Super impressive for Apple. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2251.0s)]
*  People really loved it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2254.0s)]
*  It was a kind of a show that spoke to the time really well. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2255.0s)]
*  They knew that people were looking for something light and fun. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2258.0s)]
*  And it was just that. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2261.0s)]
*  And for me, it's because we do such a wide breadth of programming. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2263.0s)]
*  And I'm there. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2267.0s)]
*  What I'm looking to do is make a show this make shows that are so good that when you're in the middle of the one you're watching, like I know you told me you're watching. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2269.0s)]
*  Nobody wants this. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2276.0s)]
*  She's got a good episodes ahead that somewhere around episode six, you start thinking, I hope the next one is good. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2277.0s)]
*  Before this is over, I hope the next thing is going to be great. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2286.0s)]
*  And we deliver on that so often that you come to expect us to make your favorite show over and over and over again. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2289.0s)]
*  And that requires a lot. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2295.0s)]
*  And I watch everything. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2297.0s)]
*  So you ask that question. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2298.0s)]
*  As a fan, I watch all of our competitors. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2300.0s)]
*  I watch all the movies that come out. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2302.0s)]
*  I really consume a lot of content. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2304.0s)]
*  So but I do what I do know is, is that there's a little bit of kismet in all of them. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2307.0s)]
*  You know, every once in a while, like that show, Nobody Wants This was passed everywhere. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2312.0s)]
*  We were the last stop. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2317.0s)]
*  It got pitched at Hulu, ABC, Freeform, Amazon, Apple, everywhere. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2319.0s)]
*  And our team saw something in it. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2324.0s)]
*  Why did they? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2326.0s)]
*  Why did they? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2327.0s)]
*  I mean, sorry, go off and have another half hour conversation. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2328.0s)]
*  But why did they say no to it? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2331.0s)]
*  Were they worried about the the setup? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2332.0s)]
*  I mean, again, I think somebody you see something in it that somebody else that everyone else didn't for us. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2337.0s)]
*  For me, I think it was a little bit of Aaron and Sarah Foster. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2343.0s)]
*  This was Aaron's creation. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2347.0s)]
*  I kind of knew her story and knew her voice and the fact that she captured her voice so perfectly in this pilot script was so impressive. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2349.0s)]
*  But also, again, the shows not being exactly what they were when they came in, because it came to Netflix. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2357.0s)]
*  We got Kristen Bell and Kristen Bell insisted on Adam Brody. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2362.0s)]
*  As soon as right on the way in. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2365.0s)]
*  So the show became what it is because it was on Netflix. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2366.0s)]
*  It may not have been that show if it was somewhere else. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2369.0s)]
*  So it's again part of that kismet. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2372.0s)]
*  And a lot of it is like to when I say we we care about the customer, we think about the members every day. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2374.0s)]
*  Will our members love this? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2380.0s)]
*  What are the chances? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2382.0s)]
*  Not am I impressed with this? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2383.0s)]
*  Is that something for me? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2384.0s)]
*  I watch a lot of things that I'm glad we didn't make that I love because I don't think a lot of people would have watched them. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2385.0s)]
*  But I do think in general and what I really look at is that that that can focus on consumer joy will win every time you have to figure out what the business model is to support it. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2391.0s)]
*  But it will win every time. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2401.0s)]
*  OK, very last question. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2403.0s)]
*  One answer. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2404.0s)]
*  What do I watch when I finished? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2405.0s)]
*  Nobody wants this. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2407.0s)]
*  I know what you're going to put it again and get back to your mood. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2409.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're going to be in the mood for. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2412.0s)]
*  You know, you'll love. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2414.0s)]
*  We have a show coming up in a couple of weeks called Black Doves out of the UK with Keira Knightley. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2415.0s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GCXva5_U8&t=2421.0s)]
