# European Officials Talk Ukraine Aid, Deterring Putin and More | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M)
*  Thank you to our trio of foreign ministers here, David Cameron of the UK, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=0.0s)]
*  Annalena Baerbock from Germany and Radek Sikorski of Poland. We only have about 40 minutes which, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=4.32s)]
*  given the state of the world today, is definitely not long enough. Plus I want to take a few [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=10.64s)]
*  questions at the end. So I think we'll jump straight in. Annalena, I wanted to start with you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=14.88s)]
*  Tomorrow marks the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. You've just come here, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=19.76s)]
*  I think along with David, from the G20 in Brazil, where I'm told you were sat at a table [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=25.36s)]
*  with Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia. You've called for an end to the war in Ukraine. Can [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=29.76s)]
*  you tell us what needs to happen for that to be a reality? Well, it's very simple and easy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=35.2s)]
*  Putin has to withdraw his tanks, has to stop bombing schools and hospitals, and then the world [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=40.72s)]
*  would be free again and the war would be over. And this is what we told the Russian foreign minister [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=46.64s)]
*  very directly, not only David and I, but everybody at the table. Maybe not all 19 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=53.36s)]
*  other G20 members directly in his face, but we can really see a change in the world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=60.88s)]
*  Two years ago, when there was a G20 meeting directly after this horrible invasion of Russia [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=67.68s)]
*  to Ukraine, I mean, we had a debate at this table. The fake news, the lies being spread by Putin [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=73.28s)]
*  were all around the table, blaming NATO, blaming us, blaming Ukraine, that they would have started [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=80.24s)]
*  this war. This is all over. This is all over. The whole world has suffered. The whole world has [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=88.32s)]
*  experienced that this is a war not only against Ukraine, not only against the European peace order, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=94.24s)]
*  but it's a war against the charter of the United Nations. And the poorest in the world are feeling [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=100.24s)]
*  the effects. So we are crystal clear, obviously, he has to withdraw. Unfortunately, we see that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=104.72s)]
*  he's leading the war not only against Ukraine, against his own people, like we saw, killing Navalny, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=110.64s)]
*  now arresting Russian teenagers, his own children who mourn for Navalny. So obviously, he is not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  acting in a way human beings would act in this kind of situation. Responsible leadership would [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=127.68s)]
*  act. So your question coming back, how would it end? It would be simple if Russia would end this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=134.64s)]
*  war now. They have started it. But as they are not doing it, the only option for us is to keep up [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=139.92s)]
*  our support, as we have done the last two years for Ukraine, so they can defend themselves and make [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=145.6s)]
*  clear that we will never give up for a free and peaceful Ukraine. So David, you were there as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=151.6s)]
*  well. Did you detect any change from Lavrov, any sort of chink? No, I mean, he looked completely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=157.44s)]
*  shame faced when Annalena did a great job of absolutely eyeballing him and addressing him [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=163.68s)]
*  directly. And I did the same thing. They just are shame faced. He mumbled through his script about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=169.6s)]
*  what was happening in the world without any confidence at all. And as Annalena said, he was [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=176.16s)]
*  attacked from not just us, but also the Canadians, the French, others. And I think people can see [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=180.8s)]
*  that there's no excuse. When you look back now, two years in, there was just no excuse. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=186.56s)]
*  I mean, what I said in my contribution was, well, which one is it? Are they Nazis or are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=193.28s)]
*  they brothers? Is it a country that doesn't exist or is it an existential threat? How can something [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  that doesn't exist be a threat? How can people be Nazis when you're acting like Nazis and taking [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=204.08s)]
*  someone else's country and hoping the world doesn't notice? So the arguments are so strong. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=208.24s)]
*  The frustration I think we all have is that, add up our economies and we outmatch Russia 25 to 1. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=212.8s)]
*  We've got to make that difference count. And one of the reasons for being here, not only at the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=218.56s)]
*  United Nations, but here in the United States, is the US can make the biggest difference, has made [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  a huge difference, but can make an even bigger difference. And my appeal would be, look, of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=231.04s)]
*  course this is about Ukraine's security and of course it's about Europe's security, but it's also [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=235.28s)]
*  about your security. We know, I mean, in two ways. One, we know from history that if we allow [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=239.28s)]
*  dictators in Europe to take territory, redraw boundaries by force, the cost ultimately to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=245.36s)]
*  America in terms of lives and money gets higher and higher the longer you put off really leaning [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  in and helping. And the second thing is, you know, if we fail it's not just Putin that's celebrating, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=257.6s)]
*  it's Xi Jinping, it's Iran, it's North Korea. And so American security and the future of American [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  security is very much on the line as well. So there's obviously this tremendous debate going [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=271.76s)]
*  on in America at the moment, there's an election coming. Radek, I was going to ask you, what would [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=276.0s)]
*  your message be to skeptical Americans who say they don't see the case for spending their [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=280.88s)]
*  taxpayers' money on defending Ukraine, as David was saying? What would you say to them vis-a-vis [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  this aid package which isn't making any progress? Given that as well, the Ukrainians pointed directly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=293.52s)]
*  to their lack of ammunition when they lost the town, this key to town of Avika. Well, I'd say the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=301.04s)]
*  following. Since Vladimir Putin now says we are the enemy, we didn't want that, but he's treating us [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=306.8s)]
*  as the enemy. The defensive war that Ukrainians are fighting is really good value for money for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  the United States without sacrificing a single American soldier for the price of three, four [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=322.8s)]
*  percent of an annual US defense budget. The Ukrainians have already destroyed half the Russian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=329.2s)]
*  army. It's a good deal for the United States. Plus, Europe has already ordered something like 90 billion [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=334.96s)]
*  dollars worth of new equipment from the United States since the war because we're worried. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=344.48s)]
*  And remember that something like 70 percent of the money that would go into the supplemental would [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  be spent in the United States on American equipment. Plus, there is the issue of American [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=355.2s)]
*  credibility. The US president went to Kiev, planted the standard of the United States, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=362.4s)]
*  and said we will back you for as long as it takes. We'll do whatever it takes. And words have [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=367.52s)]
*  consequences. If the United States doesn't go through, your allies all around the world will [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=374.0s)]
*  notice. What's the atmosphere like in Europe at the moment? Because it may not be probable, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=381.6s)]
*  but it is possible that under a new presidency America steps away from NATO. What would then [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  happen? To what extent could Europe go it alone vis-à-vis Ukraine? Well, I'm not a fan of talking [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=398.48s)]
*  things down if this is the correct English saying. Because we are here, I can only underline what my [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=407.6s)]
*  colleagues and friends have said, we are defending not only Ukraine. We are defending the European [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=414.8s)]
*  peace order as Europeans, obviously, but also as NATO countries and also as a free world. We as a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=421.44s)]
*  free world are defending freedom in the world. We are defending the cartel of the United Nations. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=428.88s)]
*  And as David had put it already, we're in a situation of a fight between liberal democracies [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=434.88s)]
*  and autocracies, between dictators which do not want to negotiate about new treaties or negotiate [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=442.4s)]
*  about a new international order. They want to destroy the international order. And this is why [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=450.48s)]
*  we have to stand united. And I'm a bit reluctant even though I underline everything what has been [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=456.64s)]
*  said about kindly pushing on our dearest friend because we have been in a similar situation. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=463.52s)]
*  When this war broke out, obviously many people also hear from the other side of the Atlantic [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=472.08s)]
*  said, so where's Germany? Can you do more? So I know how it feels like. However, I must say [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=478.64s)]
*  this is now the situation I think Europe has delivered. Even with our dearest European friends, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=485.68s)]
*  which are not part, unfortunately, of the European Union anymore, we have made clear there's no [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=491.92s)]
*  inch between neither the 27 of the European Union. Okay, sometimes we discuss with one of the European [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=497.92s)]
*  Union, but we have made crystal clear no matter where we disagree on other topics, nuclear, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=504.24s)]
*  I don't know, trade issues. On this question, there's nothing between us. And it goes the same [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  with the Brits. Yeah, I mean, we had discussions, obviously, as well, but there's no discussion that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=515.76s)]
*  we stand united. And this is our strength. And it was now for two years our strength also between [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=520.96s)]
*  the Atlantic. I mean, never before. I was born in Germany West, always in freedom and democracy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=527.12s)]
*  I mean, NATO in Germany, in my family, I'm from a Green Party, you know, I made a joke, yeah, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=535.84s)]
*  like when I came into office and now being part also as important NATO meetings, well, hopefully [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=542.32s)]
*  everybody my families can support it, then the Russian invasion in Ukraine started. And suddenly, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=548.64s)]
*  one of my daughters said at the breakfast table a couple of weeks later, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=554.96s)]
*  Mom, thanks God, we do have NATO. I was like, don't tell your grandfather. Yeah. But he obviously [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=558.88s)]
*  also changed totally his course. Many politicians, people in Germany change course because they know [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=566.0s)]
*  not only European Union has been our life insurance in the last decade, NATO is our life insurance. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=572.16s)]
*  And this is so I totally agree with everybody here. US has to stay with us in their own interest, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=577.76s)]
*  but also in the interest of the free world. Poland is the only country in the EU and nature [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=584.4s)]
*  that has Russia and Ukraine as neighbors. We are closer and therefore we feel this crisis [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  more keenly. And what I would add to what Annalena said is that we do need a greater sense of urgency. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=598.08s)]
*  Ukraine is outgunned in the Battle of Avdiivka estimates are between seven and eight to one in [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=608.16s)]
*  artillery capability. The Ukrainians are fighting like lions, but you cannot fight with bare hands. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=616.64s)]
*  They are running out of ammunition for anti-aircraft missiles that are protecting [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=623.2s)]
*  Ukrainian cities. And when soldiers don't have artillery shells, they have to have to do close [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=628.72s)]
*  combat fighting. That means the Ukrainian casualties are greater. Every shell that we [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=634.56s)]
*  deliver to Ukraine urgently will save lives. That's why we need this American supplemental [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=641.1199999999999s)]
*  as soon as possible. Yes. And what about long range missiles though? Because I know France and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=648.8s)]
*  the UK have delivered long range missiles and the Ukrainians would like them from Germany too. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=654.88s)]
*  I think it's one of the biggest game changers because the ability of the Ukrainians to show [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=659.52s)]
*  that Crimea is under threat completely undermines Putin's narrative that somehow things are moving [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=665.6s)]
*  in his direction. And that's what the long range, whether it's the storm shadow, whether it's the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=672.24s)]
*  French scalp or whether it's the American attack, it makes a huge difference. So I think those [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=676.4s)]
*  weapons, I mean, Radix right, there's a shell point which is they need 6,000 a day and they've [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=682.56s)]
*  got 2,000 a day so we've got to fix that. But these long range weapons that help take the fight [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=687.12s)]
*  right to Crimea, which is part of Ukraine's territory, make a huge difference. We've done it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=691.92s)]
*  We're obviously working with allies to try and make them do more. I just make one other point on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=696.8s)]
*  the NATO front which perhaps helps in the American debate and maybe on both sides of the aisle, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=700.88s)]
*  which is that one of the things that happened is NATO has got a lot stronger. The fact that Sweden [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=705.68s)]
*  and Finland are joining, you've got two highly capable countries. I mean, Finland's capable of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=710.16s)]
*  putting almost a million people under arms because of the history that they've had and the training [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=714.64s)]
*  they've done. Sweden has got great capabilities from Saab and Gripen aircraft and all the rest of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=720.16s)]
*  it. So if you think about it from either presidential candidate, you're investing now in a stronger NATO, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=725.76s)]
*  a better NATO, where many more members have reached 2% and are going beyond 2%. And you talk to the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=734.0s)]
*  Baltic states, they're going way higher than that. So I think it's investing and joining in [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=739.44s)]
*  something that's successful. And while, of course, we look at Adbika and have our concerns about that, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  zoom out a bit and you can see the Ukrainians have sunk 20% of the Russian Black Sea fleet. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  They pushed the Russians right back in the Black Sea. They're exporting again. They're going to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=756.32s)]
*  export their entire 23 grain harvest. They've taken about half the territory that Putin took when he [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  invaded two years ago. And with these long range weapons, they can threaten Crimea. So I think [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=767.52s)]
*  one can paint a different picture of the way things are going. And with that, if the US makes [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  that decision, I think we can really change the terms of trade over the course of this year. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=779.36s)]
*  And just to, but so obviously this situation has accelerated the NATO, the defense spending of a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=783.68s)]
*  lot of European NATO countries. Do you think it's also going to accelerate moves towards a single [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=789.92s)]
*  European defense force? Because there is a lack of coordination still in Europe amongst different [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=794.64s)]
*  armies. Radik? I think it's unhelpful to talk about a single European army because that will [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=799.84s)]
*  not happen. You know, when you were fighting the British for independence, you created the continental [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=805.92s)]
*  army rather than joined up the state militias. Right? So we need a European defense capability [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=812.4s)]
*  in addition to the national armies. And we have plans to create a reinforced brigade. It's a good [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=820.56s)]
*  beginning. What we really, really need urgently now is to supplement the European defense budget, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=827.68s)]
*  which is wonderfully called the European peace facility. We've spent 7 billion from it on the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=835.04s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine, but we've spent that money. We need another 5 billion this year, and I hope [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=842.0s)]
*  it will happen. I just want to go back to Putin. Obviously you mentioned this horrible news that he [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=846.72s)]
*  had Navalny killed. Last week there was news that he'd had a Russian dissident shot dead in Spain. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=854.24s)]
*  You, David, know only too well he has no shame in sending assassins to the UK to poison people. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=862.4s)]
*  He's running amok, not just in his own country, but in the rest of Europe. He also betrays weakness [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=869.36s)]
*  too. My question is how much longer are we going to stand back and let him run amok like this? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=876.64s)]
*  Basically, you know, he's destroyed things as we know it in Europe. He's killing people with impunity. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=881.92s)]
*  How can we stop him? I don't know which one of you wants to ask. Well, I think you've got to think of all [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  the different aspects of combating Russia. Not Russia, because we have no quarrel with the Russian [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=892.96s)]
*  people, but combating Putin and obviously there's the military side we've been talking about. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=899.12s)]
*  I think to be truthful, I remember Obama coming to the EU and saying you're not doing enough to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=903.04s)]
*  combat Russian disinformation in the Balkans and elsewhere. I think we have woken up to that and a [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  lot more is being done on every front, whether it's sanctioning the Russians who are behind Navalny's [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  death, which Britain went first on and America is doing that I think this week, whether it is [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  countering misinformation in the Balkans and elsewhere, whether it's making sure we're checking [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=925.52s)]
*  on how Russians are trying to affect our politics or affect political parties and media. I think [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=930.0s)]
*  there's a lot sharper operation going on today than there was in the past. But the sanctions, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=936.56s)]
*  I mean, a whole load more were unveiled this morning by Biden, but to be honest, the sanctions [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=940.88s)]
*  aren't really having much of an effect at the moment, are they? I mean, isn't there more, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=945.52s)]
*  Annalena, that the West could do to sanction Putin? Well, there is way more. We have [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=949.52s)]
*  13 sanctions package passed, but nobody believed. I mean, again, we are not talking about [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=956.64s)]
*  political leaders in a democracy where you [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=963.92s)]
*  run down your economy, then voters would say, well, they didn't do great, next time we vote for [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=969.04s)]
*  somebody else. I mean, for logic of democracies, yeah? What Putin has done to his own country, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=973.84s)]
*  he would be out of office after two days. So nobody from us, when we started with the sanctions, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=979.6s)]
*  believed that the sanction package would stop this kind of invasion. But sanctions are important. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=985.52s)]
*  We are showing the world, we are showing to the Putin regime, to the people around them, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=992.24s)]
*  to those who voted in the Duma for this war, those who are responsible for kidnapping children, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=997.28s)]
*  that the breach of fundamental law is not only seen in the world, that it's being sanctioned. And [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1004.24s)]
*  yes, unfortunately, it will take time also with the effects, yeah? Especially, I mean, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1010.16s)]
*  there are the charges with the international criminal law court. One day, they will be held [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1016.16s)]
*  responsible for that. And this is very important. And this comes in addition to, obviously, the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1021.8399999999999s)]
*  military support, so it's obviously not only the sanction, but the sanctions show also to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1027.2s)]
*  countries in the world, to companies, I mean, you can just not cooperate with a dictator like that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1032.96s)]
*  Yeah, so the effects are also important for others. I would like to underline what, again, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1038.88s)]
*  my friends have said, on the question of defense and on the question of strength. I mean, we are [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1044.8000000000002s)]
*  not letting Putin go away with poisoning, either in the UK or killing somebody in the Tiergarten [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  in Berlin. We are acting on that one. And also from the military side, sorry for coming back to that, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1057.0400000000002s)]
*  but I think it's important. I mean, Putin believes he can wait us out. And we shouldn't give an [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1063.52s)]
*  impression also in a debate like this that this is true. No, we stand with Ukraine as long as it [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1070.08s)]
*  takes. And what Radik says, this is, my chancellor called it zeitgeist, obviously, that we deliver [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1075.28s)]
*  weapons towards Ukraine. This is our zeitgeist. But it's plural. They are zeitgeist in plural. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1080.56s)]
*  They are more zeitgeist. That we are working now on strengthening the European pillar within the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1086.24s)]
*  NATO. This is, again, another kind of revolution for us, that we are setting up not only the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1091.12s)]
*  European peace facility to support Ukraine, but that we are having common tenders to actually [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  build a European defense industry. At the moment, unfortunately, we are very much competing against [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1102.6399999999999s)]
*  each other. We have realized in Ukraine when we delivered weapons that it doesn't help that we [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  share howitzers, Germany and Dutch, because they don't work perfectly together in the field, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1113.04s)]
*  that we have to produce these kind of military support, then do a common production like [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1118.56s)]
*  ammunition we are doing now. So Europe is getting not only stronger, NATO is getting stronger on [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1125.28s)]
*  that way. And we will follow up on that one again, as long as it takes. And this was a total [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  miscalculation of Putin. I mean, Putin believed he had the uniforms in his tanks where he could [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1138.8s)]
*  celebrate after two months conquering Kiev. And everything was ruined on that one. And this is why [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1145.44s)]
*  I mean, politics is always about is the glass half empty or half full? Yeah. And I think true [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  leadership is that you're seeing it is half full, and you're working on every drip in the glass, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  that it's even getting fuller. And this is what we are doing right now with 13 sanction packages, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1167.28s)]
*  with an increase of our military support, 50 billion by the European Union, 30 billion alone [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1172.4s)]
*  by Germany, and not to forget, with a support of economic recovery, economic recovery conference [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1179.76s)]
*  in London, now in Berlin, and the support for the people. I mean, 4 million refugees have come [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1187.44s)]
*  to Europe, we gave them a home, showing that we don't let anybody alone. And I think this whole [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1193.0400000000002s)]
*  package is what we have to make crystal clear. We keep this package as long as it takes. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1198.72s)]
*  Let's just quickly ask, there's been some talk in Germany about Germany developing its own nuclear [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1204.08s)]
*  weapon, possibly on its own or in conjunction with the UK or France. Is that something that's likely to happen? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1208.48s)]
*  I think it's forbidden by the unification treaty. Right. Oh, well, you're answering it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1213.28s)]
*  So you see the close partnership. I'll make one point on sanctions, because actually it's important [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1218.88s)]
*  for the press can help with this. The sanctions packages were all passing. Britain independently, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1224.8s)]
*  but it coordinated with the EU and America. These are good. They do hit Russia in terms of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1230.48s)]
*  the dual use goods they want, but they're only effective if we follow them all the way around [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1236.64s)]
*  the world and check out the countries that are still producing dual use goods for the Russian [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1240.24s)]
*  war machine. And it comes back to what Radik said, which is we've got to want this more than anything [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1244.48s)]
*  else. So when it comes to do you sanction the company in China, yes, you've got to. Do you sanction [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1248.72s)]
*  the company in Turkey as we did in a two LA? Yes, you've got to want it more than your bilateral [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1253.92s)]
*  relationship with any other country. And I think it's a real test for us because, you know, otherwise [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1259.3600000000001s)]
*  they will get the goods they need from elsewhere. Careful with the argument that the Russian economy [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1264.48s)]
*  is doing well because GDP is a very blunt measure. It doesn't actually reflect what's going on. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1268.64s)]
*  For 2% by the way. They've lost their most lucrative market for gas, both Germany and Poland. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1276.64s)]
*  We didn't have much anyway. You were getting some through France. That's what Putin always used to [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1287.2s)]
*  say to me. I don't know. But anyway, but none now. You're right. And they've lost a million of their [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1293.76s)]
*  most talented people. And they've depleted half of their national reserve fund. GDP measures [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1297.2s)]
*  activity. When you stop producing consumer goods and start making tanks and shells, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1305.52s)]
*  your GDP may rise, but you're still ruining your country. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1311.6s)]
*  Radik, I also wanted to ask you, just stay on this point for a bit longer. How much should Europe [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1316.24s)]
*  fear a Trump presidency? A second Trump presidency? When you start interfering in other people's [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1321.84s)]
*  internal affairs, you're now very slippery slip. So you're not going to comment on this? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1328.08s)]
*  We prefer to remember that President Trump delivered the first Javelin anti-tank missiles [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1335.52s)]
*  to Ukraine even before the war. Good. OK, just zooming out a bit, David, what kind of message [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1341.2s)]
*  does it, what would it send to China if America doesn't pass its aid package to Ukraine? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it sends a very bad message because effectively, you know, the Chinese are [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1356.4s)]
*  watching this. They are giving support to Putin, although not as much support as he would like. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1361.12s)]
*  And I think in the arguments and discussions they're having with every country about come with us, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1368.56s)]
*  have a relationship with us, America is unreliable, it would strengthen that argument they make [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  in an enormous way. So I think, as I said in my very first remarks here, you know, this is as much [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1380.56s)]
*  to me, I mean, I make this argument, I'm not trying to lecture or tell American congressmen [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1386.4s)]
*  what to do or, you know, that's not what it's about. I love my own country, but I love America, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1391.0400000000002s)]
*  too. I think this is really important for America, for American security. And I know that lots of [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1397.52s)]
*  people in Congress are hugely concerned about the role of China. And if you're concerned about the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1402.48s)]
*  role of China, you must make sure that Putin doesn't win. And it would be the biggest gift [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1408.0s)]
*  for Putin and it would be the biggest gift for China at this moment. I met with the Chinese [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1412.96s)]
*  foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference and I told him two things. Number one, don't make [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1419.76s)]
*  us choose between you, our biggest trading partner, and the United States, our most important ally, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  because if we have to choose, you won't like the choice that we make. And number two, China is the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1431.8400000000001s)]
*  country that can actually force the end of this war, because Russia cannot survive without trade [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1438.32s)]
*  with China, because it's made itself a vassal of China. Also, China could tread in the path of the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  United States, which became a global power rather than a hemispheric one, in 1905, with Teddy [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1454.32s)]
*  Roosevelt mediating the Portsmouth Treaty at the end of the Russo-Japanese War. We would all be [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1462.08s)]
*  grateful to China if China helped to end this war. What did he say? He smiled. He was inscrutable. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1470.48s)]
*  Sounds a bit like my meeting. So where do you think China stands? What do you think they want [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1482.08s)]
*  to happen? I mean, they're looking at this mess in Europe. They're thinking, what do you think [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1489.2s)]
*  they're thinking? Anilina or David, I mean, if you've got any... I think they're enjoying, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1492.64s)]
*  to an extent, the fact that we're not as united as we should be. I think that's why this American [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1502.8s)]
*  package is so important. You do that, and then you've had the EU package, the British package, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1509.76s)]
*  the American package. We're all signing these security guarantees with Ukraine, which are [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1513.44s)]
*  important because they're basically saying, if this were to happen again, we wouldn't start [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1518.0s)]
*  where we started in 2022. We'd start where we are now with massive support and equipment and [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1522.0s)]
*  training and everything else. So I think that's why it's so important. I think they probably feel [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1527.12s)]
*  misled by Putin, who told them it would be easy, and I hope they also see that recovering what you [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1536.48s)]
*  regard as a renegade province is harder than you think. But obviously, I mean, this outbreak of the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1543.2s)]
*  war was the best what could happen to China, because Russia, as Radek has said, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1549.92s)]
*  gave themselves totally in their hands. Europe, obviously, is totally occupied, and the Americans [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1557.04s)]
*  as well, with rescuing the peace on the European continent. So in this situation, especially in [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1564.16s)]
*  the beginning, I mean, they just watched and saw. But obviously, not only they, but the whole world [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1572.24s)]
*  saw that the consequences, as I said in the beginning, are not only affecting Europe or the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1579.36s)]
*  transatlantic countries, but it's affecting the whole world. So we could see China within the last [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1585.36s)]
*  two years always, when it endangered their narrative about them being the rescuer of the world [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1591.44s)]
*  for peace and especially for equality in the whole world. So every time when it got negative for them, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1599.52s)]
*  they interfered. And this is why for us, it was also so important to make crystal clear to them, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1606.16s)]
*  you have a responsibility. I mean, it's not only Russia, P5, Security Council member responsible [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1611.92s)]
*  for the peace of the world, violating the peace, but you're also P5 country. So you do have a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1618.08s)]
*  responsibility. And I think this is important to always make that very clear, as Roddick has, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1624.4s)]
*  that it's bilateral as we are all doing. So when this nuclear question came up, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1629.92s)]
*  with not only with Saporizhzhya, but also in the beginning, I mean, there was clear messaging, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  and I'm really thankful to President Biden, very clear messaging. I mean, you have to [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  stand up now towards China. And obviously, there was some messaging. We saw this in waves, I would [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1646.0800000000002s)]
*  say. Yeah. So sometimes there was messaging from China, but not always. We had the question whether [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1652.32s)]
*  there's drones or other military support. So we always have to remember China as well about the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  responsibility and works even better and coming back to G20. And this is why in these times, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1665.28s)]
*  we shouldn't just resign in all the fronts, but saying multilateralism can work. We had many [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1670.72s)]
*  friends and colleagues from all over the world also asking China when we had the grain situation [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1675.84s)]
*  in the world that Putin was using also hunger as a weapon. I mean, there were African countries [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1681.84s)]
*  calling out what's going on. So this is why the grain deal worked in the end. And now, thanks God, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1687.36s)]
*  the Ukraine did it themselves. But also counting on the others, yeah, that they are also standing [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1694.3999999999999s)]
*  up, always pressuring China on their responsibility is something again, which we also have to do in [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1700.72s)]
*  this moment. Yeah. So look, I know you're all here to talk about Ukraine, but obviously there's [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1706.08s)]
*  another war going on, which we should talk about as well. David, what needs to happen to bring the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1710.8s)]
*  war in the Middle East to an end? What needs to happen is you need to have a pause in the fighting [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  so you can get this hostage deal done. There are talks going on in Paris right now, I think, and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1722.96s)]
*  we desperately need that to happen. The situation in Gaza is appalling. Too many people have died. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1729.28s)]
*  The suffering is terrible. But I think the fastest way to get the ceasefire everyone wants is [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1734.4s)]
*  actually to start with the pause, do the hostage deal. If that pause lasts for 45 days, 60 days, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1741.6s)]
*  you then pile in every part of momentum that you can to turn it into a sustainable ceasefire without [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1747.44s)]
*  going back to fighting. That's actually the best way to get it done. Now, what does that consist of? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1753.6s)]
*  I think it consists of all the hostages being freed. It consists of the Hamas leaders responsible [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1758.16s)]
*  for October the 7th out of Gaza. You've got to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure. You've [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1764.3200000000002s)]
*  got to give the Palestinians a new Palestinian authority government, which is technocratic in [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1769.76s)]
*  nature but capable of governing the West Bank and Gaza. Crucially, you've got to provide a [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1774.88s)]
*  horizon, a political horizon to the Palestinian people so that they can see there is what the [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1780.4s)]
*  Saudi foreign minister rightly refers to as an unstoppable momentum towards a two-state solution. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1785.68s)]
*  Now, that's a lot to ask for, but you've got to have a plan. Maybe it won't work. Maybe you [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1791.8400000000001s)]
*  get the pause, you get the hostages, and you can't get the momentum, and then the war starts again, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  which would be tragic. But I think if you get that pause, you can really pour everything in [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  to creating that momentum. I would say the one bright spot of this conversation we had in Munich [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1806.16s)]
*  with a lot of the Gulf countries, which Annalena brought together and we coached at a meeting, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1812.0s)]
*  they really want to help lean in and provide some of the answers. And there are really two [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1818.64s)]
*  parts to the answer. One is, what can we do and say about creating momentum towards a Palestinian [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1824.4s)]
*  state? And secondly, what can we do to make sure Israel genuinely feels secure that October the [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1830.64s)]
*  7th can't happen again? And those two elements are really what lies at the heart of it. So [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1836.48s)]
*  you know, that's my hope. And the sooner that pause comes, the better. I mean, it could happen, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1841.68s)]
*  you know, it could happen in days if they could get this hostage negotiation together. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1846.32s)]
*  And that's what needs to happen. Right. To what extent has the Middle East War sort of confused [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  the message or made everything more complicated around the situation in Europe? I think it has, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1856.16s)]
*  and in that sense, it's benefited Putin. Right. Yeah. Well, look, we've got time for some questions. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  If anybody would like to ask any of these foreign ministers a question. There's one over there. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1870.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. I'm Mark Stone from Sky News. A question for you all, if I can, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1876.8s)]
*  or a couple of questions. First of all, it's striking that two years on, your message here [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  in New York, no less, is not for Russia, but for America. I wonder why you can't get through to [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1886.8s)]
*  America the importance, as you see it, of passing the bill. And I guess, I mean, I travel around [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1893.6s)]
*  America a lot. I'm not talking about Capitol Hill. I'm talking about the American people who, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1899.2s)]
*  who in quite significant numbers, do not see Ukraine as a priority at all. Why can't you [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  get through to them? That's my first question. The second question is, should you take Trump's, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1911.6000000000001s)]
*  President Trump's, threat of pulling out of NATO seriously? Or is he just doing what he did before, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1916.96s)]
*  assuming he would win the election, doing what he did before, and trying to get you to pay more, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1925.84s)]
*  specifically some continent European countries? I mean, first of all, we're not just here to talk to [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1930.72s)]
*  America. You know, we're at the United Nations. We're going to be talking very directly to Russia, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1938.56s)]
*  but also to all the other countries that are there, to say why it's worthwhile continuing to [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1942.9599999999998s)]
*  back Ukraine. That this is not just about Ukraine's sovereignty and stability, not just Europe's [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1947.4399999999998s)]
*  sovereignty. It's every country in the world. I mean, what is more important to any country [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1953.52s)]
*  than a belief in your own borders, your own sovereignty, your own inviolability, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1958.32s)]
*  and what is more dangerous than rewarding a big bullying country like Putin's Russia, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1963.68s)]
*  being able to redraw boundaries by force and keep that territory? Every country in the world should [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1969.36s)]
*  be worried about that. So that, now how we get through with, look, I totally understand, in the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1973.2s)]
*  world we live in, with all the pressures and the difficulties of deindustrialization in some parts [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1978.8s)]
*  of our country and the pressures of illegal migration, we've all got these problems. I [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1985.52s)]
*  completely understand how difficult it is sometimes for politicians to step forward and to take these [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1989.12s)]
*  actions. And that's why I think we are trying to explain it in the best way we can, that we think [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=1995.36s)]
*  this is in America's interests. We think, as Raddick said, it's incredible value for money [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2000.96s)]
*  in terms of destroying, you know, not just half of Putin's army, but half his tanks and his [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2007.44s)]
*  materiel. So we think it's good for America, but we are respectful of America's politics and [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2012.88s)]
*  how we have to try and help. There are plenty in Congress who want that argument to be won, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2020.96s)]
*  and we've got to help them. Well, I would say in these moments, again, it's about political leadership. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2025.68s)]
*  I mean, I subscribe to everything that David has said about the Middle East. I mean, we're working [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2031.0400000000002s)]
*  on this plan together, but we hear also there from the Israeli government, the Prime Minister [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  there, about 80% of our population doesn't want to have this peace plan. Well, I mean, politics and [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2042.72s)]
*  leadership, especially when it's about peace and war, is not about polls. Yeah, true leadership is [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2048.24s)]
*  about leading the right path, convincing your people with the best answers. We would have never [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2055.44s)]
*  German reunification. We would have never European Eastern enlargement on the European continent if [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2063.76s)]
*  we would have heard the polls, because it's normal that humans like the Swede's Quo, because they [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2070.6400000000003s)]
*  never know how the future will be. They only know how the past was. So it's about this is politics [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2075.76s)]
*  it's all about. Yeah, if you would just have the society to agree on everything on a daily [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2081.92s)]
*  space, then you wouldn't need government. And this is why I think this argumentation about, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2086.5600000000004s)]
*  and it doesn't matter, we have the same in Europe as well, the argumentation, we cannot do it [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2092.7999999999997s)]
*  because the polls are at the moment on this kind of situation. This is why in a democracy you have [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2097.12s)]
*  elections, a couple of years. Obviously, the power is in the hand of the people when they vote, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2102.08s)]
*  but the power and especially the responsibility is in the hands of those being elected. And this is [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2107.2s)]
*  why I mean, we from outside cannot convince obviously the legislators here all by ourselves. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2113.8399999999997s)]
*  But when I went, for example, to Texas in September, meeting there, the Republican Abbott, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2120.16s)]
*  speaking about the question of Ukraine, but mainly speaking about the economic relationship [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2128.3999999999996s)]
*  between Texas and the European Union, especially Texas and Germany, because we have so many trading [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2134.08s)]
*  partners there. And I was just saying, because he said we want to increase, I was happily surprised, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2138.8799999999997s)]
*  especially on renewable energy and these kinds of parts. And I said, we want to do this as well, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2145.92s)]
*  but unfortunately, we are being very occupied with this Russian war at the moment. So our [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2151.28s)]
*  investments, they also have to go to Ukraine. So in making clear, I mean, if this war would go on [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2156.64s)]
*  like this, if the US would withdraw from NATO or for whatever military support, I mean, nothing in [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2163.36s)]
*  the world is normal again in this kind of thing. This will touch every state in the United States. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2170.32s)]
*  This will even touch every city where we have European connections, because if the European [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2176.7200000000003s)]
*  peace order is not what it is again, I mean, nothing is normal again. And to make that clear [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2182.4s)]
*  that this is all interconnected in a globalized world, I think is of the highest importance. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2187.52s)]
*  And I want to be crystal clear. I mean, how we have worked together in the last two years, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2193.1200000000003s)]
*  I know two years as a foreign German minister in office, not only with our counterpart and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2199.52s)]
*  friend Tony Blinken, but also my chancellor with the US president. I mean, in the difficult [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2207.52s)]
*  situations which we ever faced, at least in my lifetime, we were capable of giving united answers [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2214.48s)]
*  together. And this is a unique chance. Yeah. And this is what we needed to push back on Putin. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2222.56s)]
*  And I think the same goes for the Middle East. If there wouldn't be this close alignment between [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2229.36s)]
*  some European partners and the US administration to find together with the Arab world a peace plan, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2236.72s)]
*  we will never end also this disaster, which is obviously affecting this whole world. And this [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2244.4s)]
*  only works because governments, ministers, presidents can trust each other. You shouldn't [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2249.44s)]
*  underestimate how much important for lasting relations and solutions is trust in politics. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2255.84s)]
*  And this is why we are so thankful that we're working so closely with this current government [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2262.48s)]
*  here in the United States. Just quickly, and then we've got another question here as well. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2268.16s)]
*  My argument to the American people is the following, and I think it's particularly [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2271.44s)]
*  persuasive coming from New York. Article five of the Washington treaty, NATO, has only been invoked [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2275.84s)]
*  once after the 9-11 attacks on New York. Britain sent a brigade to Kandahar. Germany sent a brigade [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2283.84s)]
*  to Masaryi Sharif. We sent a brigade to Gazania, Taf province. And after the mission was accomplished, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2292.48s)]
*  whatever you think of the mission, we didn't send an invoice to Washington, because this is an alliance. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2300.24s)]
*  And alliances are occasionally helpful to the United States too. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2307.04s)]
*  Is it another question? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2312.9599999999996s)]
*  I think, um, we made it perfectly clear. I mean, there's no better answer than running. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2317.9199999999996s)]
*  I would say NATO is looking stronger than ever. And what I remember about President Trump is he likes winners. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2322.72s)]
*  NATO is looking like a winner. Question here. Yeah. Thanks very much. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2332.24s)]
*  Julian Gorgia from the Guardian. It's a very male political view, I would say. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2336.9599999999996s)]
*  We've got to try everything. This question for Mr. Cameron and Ms. Bermack. You've just been at [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2343.4399999999996s)]
*  G20. To what extent has the Israel-Hamas war and the US refusal to call for immediate [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2350.96s)]
*  ceasefire harming your attempts to get some kind of global solidarity when it comes to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2359.36s)]
*  isolating Russia and making sanctions work better? I think there's a, there is an understanding. I [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2366.56s)]
*  mean, obviously there's a disagreement in the way some countries call for the immediate ceasefire, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2375.12s)]
*  and the way, um, Annalena and I have described the pause followed by the ceasefire. I mean, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2380.8s)]
*  fundamentally my argument is the fastest way to get a ceasefire is the way we're setting out, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2386.88s)]
*  because use the hostage deal to get the pause, use the pause to get the ceasefire. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  The problem with calling for immediate ceasefire is one, it doesn't make it happen. And two, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2395.84s)]
*  even if it did miraculously happen, if Hamas is still in charge of Gaza, and if they still have [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2400.96s)]
*  the capability to fire rockets into Israel, it's not a lasting ceasefire. It's a ceasefire that [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2405.92s)]
*  might last a day, it might last a week. And so when you patiently explain that to those who [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2410.08s)]
*  are calling for the full-on immediate ceasefire, I think they do see that the gap between us is [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2415.6s)]
*  relatively small. And while of course the fact that we haven't signed up to some of these [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2420.16s)]
*  resolutions and what have you, it does do some damage. There's no doubt about that. But I think [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2425.92s)]
*  when you explain how we really want to stop the fighting right now and how we've got a plan to do [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2430.48s)]
*  it, I think that actually helps to build some faith between the Arab world and what foreign [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2435.68s)]
*  ministers like myself and Annalena are saying. Well again, I totally agree. Just adding, again, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2442.24s)]
*  it's a question what you believe politics is all about. I mean, to feel good. And then you call [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2448.7999999999997s)]
*  for a ceasefire and say, I tick this box because I've called for a ceasefire. But unfortunately, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2455.6s)]
*  just for calling for a ceasefire doesn't mean that the ceasefire is implemented. Or if you [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2460.16s)]
*  think every day and night, and this is what we have done over the last almost four months, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2464.72s)]
*  so how do we come to a ceasefire? How do we come to a situation what David has described, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2470.0s)]
*  to dismantle Hamas? Obviously, we need partners which are closer to Hamas than we are to bring [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2477.04s)]
*  them on that path. How do we come to a situation where all hostages are free? Again, this is [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2484.16s)]
*  especially with other actors. And then also, how do we come to a situation where humanitarian aid [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2489.68s)]
*  is coming in, where the horrible suffering of thousands of people in Gaza will be at least [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2497.3599999999997s)]
*  limited and then coming to a situation where people also in Gaza can live a life in indignity? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2505.3599999999997s)]
*  And obviously, this is then our responsibility as countries which are closer to Israel [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2512.96s)]
*  and not only to give interviews, I'm calling on them, but to work with different actors also in [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2519.12s)]
*  Israel to come through this so crucial pause. We need this pause now. We need the hostage deal, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2525.3599999999997s)]
*  including freeing the hostages and the entry and full entry of humanitarian into Gaza. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2532.3199999999997s)]
*  And this is what we are working on day and night. And again, the good thing is, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2539.92s)]
*  I mean, we are more united, especially with partners in the Arab world, than maybe over Christmas. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2543.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, I would say after the 7th of October, there could have been a momentum as well [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2551.12s)]
*  where this plan which we are working on could have been implemented. But I would say at that moment, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2556.48s)]
*  some were not ready to call on Hamas, then we missed other moments and that's how life is. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2562.48s)]
*  Now we are in this moment and now we have to take, I mean, we have only a couple of few weeks left [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2569.36s)]
*  and we have to use this this week. And this is, I think, why we also here all together, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2574.1600000000003s)]
*  not only with regard to Ukraine, but also having the talks here at the United Nations to end the [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2579.44s)]
*  horrible suffering in Gaza, but also to end the horrible suffering of more than 100 people still [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2585.6800000000003s)]
*  in the hands of Hamas. We will have to wrap it up there. But thank you to this impressive troika [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2592.16s)]
*  of foreign ministers. I know you are all exhausted. We have the great troika, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2600.0s)]
*  the Weimar Triangle, France, Poland and Germany and we would love to be a part of that soon again. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2604.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, listen, I know you are all exhausted because you have been flying all over the world, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2612.08s)]
*  Brazil, Munich, the Falkland Islands. But anyway, thank you for coming here and, you know, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2615.68s)]
*  good luck with your endeavors and come back again to see us. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ39_Obf61M&t=2621.68s)]
