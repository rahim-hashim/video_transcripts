# Jeffrey Katzenberg on 2024 Election, Cybersecurity and New Health Venture | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw)
*  I'm fairly certain that there are people in the audience who are curious about your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=0.0s)]
*  views on the election campaign, given the proximity you had or still have to President Biden [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=8.32s)]
*  as chief fundraiser when he was still in the race. Now we met earlier this year and we had a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=15.76s)]
*  conversation about President Biden and his fitness to run for office and you evoked Mick Jagger. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  You said, look, look at Mick Jagger, he's 80 something. Look what 80 something year old men [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=29.36s)]
*  are capable of. And I think after that it began to be clear that not all 80 year olds are equal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=37.52s)]
*  or are made equally and that there are some in the Mick Jagger mode and some who aren't. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=44.56s)]
*  And I'm curious to know at what point did you realize that President Biden was not Mick Jagger? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=48.56s)]
*  Can we take this one? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=58.63999999999999s)]
*  Well, it actually never occurred to me. He is Mick Jagger. And I think, so I have had the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  privilege to spend the last, I would say, year and a half as a co-chair of his campaign [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=72.0s)]
*  and to have, you know, a front row seat as he set out to really fulfill a commitment, a promise, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  a determination to ensure that Donald Trump does not get back into the White House. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=88.16s)]
*  That's what he said in the very first conversation I had with him when he asked me to join up his [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=96.88s)]
*  campaign. It is what he said to me when I met with him in Las Vegas four days before he [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=102.4s)]
*  stepped out of the race. And there was never a moment in between in which [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=110.56s)]
*  he in any way, shape or form ever feared off of that mission. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  And I will say that he is one of the most empathetic, caring, generous, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=123.36s)]
*  great people that I have had the privilege to meet and work for. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=131.28s)]
*  Nevertheless, do you feel relieved that he has been able to do what he has been able to do? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=139.52s)]
*  I don't think it is a question of, you know, since I have the same mission and goal that he had and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=146.48s)]
*  continues to have, he continues to have it, I continue to have it, there is a point in time in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=154.0s)]
*  which he believes that he is going to be able to do what he wants to do. And I think that is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  the decision that he made. And it was based on data and information that came to him [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  where he said, you know, I'm going to be able to do what I want to do. And I think that is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=174.96s)]
*  the decision that he made. And I think that is the decision that he made. And I think that is the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=181.68s)]
*  decision that he made. And it was based on data and information that came to him [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=188.32s)]
*  where he said, look, I no longer am certain that I can, you know, be successful in my mission, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  and for the betterment of the country, did one of the most selfless [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=207.36s)]
*  of the most famous things I have ever witnessed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=213.6s)]
*  We know all of us in life. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=216.84s)]
*  We see it in business. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=219.1s)]
*  We see it, you know, in media and entertainment and movies, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=220.4s)]
*  sports and politics. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=224.48s)]
*  Dropping the mic when you are, you know, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=227.0s)]
*  the goat is really, really, really hard. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=231.24s)]
*  And I, it's no easier for him than it was for Mick Jagger. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=234.84s)]
*  Okay, well, perhaps I think we can come back [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=240.6s)]
*  to politics perhaps at the end. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=245.4s)]
*  That would be a really good idea. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=246.84s)]
*  Maybe we'll run out of time and we'll get on to other more. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=248.32s)]
*  Maybe there'll be some questions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=253.12s)]
*  But for now, we will get back to business to talk about Wondeko. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=255.16s)]
*  Sujaya, I'm going to come to you in a minute, I promise. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=260.64s)]
*  I just want to stick with Jeffrey just for now to ask, you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=263.36s)]
*  how did you, why have you distanced yourself so greatly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=267.0s)]
*  from sort of media, entertainment, you know, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=270.12s)]
*  you're known as a Hollywood mogul. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=273.44s)]
*  You've really stepped away from that now and put yourself [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=275.88s)]
*  into the very competitive world of technology. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=278.44s)]
*  Why did you make that, why have you made that move? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, well, a little analogous here about dropping mics. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=284.16s)]
*  So I spent 40 plus years in the media and entertainment space [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=289.24s)]
*  during what I would have to, if it wasn't the golden era [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=294.92s)]
*  of media and entertainment, it certainly was the renaissance [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=298.88s)]
*  of it, working in the 70s and 80s and 90s, even into the 2000s. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=305.4s)]
*  The, so I worked here in the city of New York as a teenager [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=312.4s)]
*  for the mayor of New York, John Lindsay. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=317.28s)]
*  He ran for president in 1972 in two primaries, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=320.32s)]
*  lost. Everybody that was on the campaign went back [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  to the city government and I wanted a new chapter. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=328.56s)]
*  I wanted something new to do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=331.64s)]
*  I wanted, I didn't want to go back [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=333.28s)]
*  and do what I'd already been doing for four years, which I loved, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  but I was ready for something. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  And in 1972, if you asked, if you were, if you had ambition [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  for fortune and fame, you went to Hollywood. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  And that is in fact what I did. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=350.28s)]
*  And I was very lucky. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=352.44s)]
*  I had a series of extraordinary mentors who really took me in, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=353.56s)]
*  polished me and propelled me through what was an exceptional set [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=362.88s)]
*  of opportunities and career. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=367.88s)]
*  Barry Diller for a decade at Paramount, Michael Eisner [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=369.2s)]
*  for a decade at Disney, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=371.84s)]
*  for two decades at DreamWorks. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=376.76s)]
*  During that period of time, probably the most, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  one of the most impactful things was the, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  how technology kept disrupting our business [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=390.6s)]
*  in very, very, very positive ways. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=396.12s)]
*  You think early into the sort of mid to late 70s, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=398.56s)]
*  the introduction of special effects. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=401.76s)]
*  When Steven Spielberg made Jaws, he took a piece of plywood, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=403.8s)]
*  cut it out in the shape of a fin, painted it gray [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=406.8s)]
*  and dragged it behind a motorboat. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=410.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=413.08s)]
*  And so you think of how impactful [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=414.96s)]
*  and how powerful these new tools of storytelling were [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  through special effects, through digital effects, into animation, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=421.76s)]
*  into everybody the first time the ballroom scene in Beauty [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  and the Beast, the stampede in Lion King. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=429.28s)]
*  These things were just incredible, incredible tools. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=432.08s)]
*  And through that, I actually had a great sort of journey [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=435.64s)]
*  up to Silicon Valley where I met many of the great tech founders [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=443.08s)]
*  and many of the great tech companies who became allies [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=448.2s)]
*  and important supporters and are continuing to always be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  on the cutting edge. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  So eight years ago, having made over 400 movies [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=459.2s)]
*  and 40 some animated movies and 85 TV shows and five Broadway plays, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=466.08s)]
*  somebody showed up at a moment where it was very clear [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=473.36s)]
*  for an independent company, animation company, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=478.2s)]
*  DreamWorks was the largest producer of animation in the world. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=481.56s)]
*  It's significantly bigger than Disney, not the company, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  just our animation business. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=490.04s)]
*  And Brian Roberts from Comcast, you know, showed up [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=491.52s)]
*  and in that proverbial thing of an offer that was just [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=497.48s)]
*  in the best interest of my shareholders and my employees [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=501.04s)]
*  and everything that I had spent 20 some odd years building. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=504.52s)]
*  And so I dropped the mic. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=508.52s)]
*  And I woke up the next day and it was as though it was 1972 again. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=511.24s)]
*  Difference was I was 65 instead of 22 [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=517.12s)]
*  and I asked myself the same exact question. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=520.6s)]
*  If I were 22 years old today, eight years ago, and I wanted fortune [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=524.64s)]
*  and fame, technology in Silicon Valley was where I was going to go. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=530.12s)]
*  And having had Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, David Geffen, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=537.24s)]
*  Steven Spielberg as my mentors, I was lucky enough [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=542.48s)]
*  to find Sujay Jaswant who's half my age and twice as smart as me. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=547.8s)]
*  And eight years later we have had just the most remarkable, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=554.88s)]
*  exciting roller coaster ride and partnership. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=558.68s)]
*  And what I will just say and then I would like to move on to this, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=563.04s)]
*  but for me this is like literally the sixth or seventh time in my career [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=568.0s)]
*  that you know that sort of one door closes another one opens [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=576.76s)]
*  and it's always been great for me. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=580.6s)]
*  And I read a quote about a year and a half or so ago. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=583.68s)]
*  I don't know who it's attributable to, but when I read it I went, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=586.64s)]
*  wow, that's literally me. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=591.08s)]
*  And here's what it is. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=594.56s)]
*  Never let your memories be better than your dreams. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=595.92s)]
*  And I wake up every day and I am so much more interested in today [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=601.0s)]
*  and tomorrow and what's in front of me. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=608.92s)]
*  And it just, what's in the past is just not what's front of mind for me [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=611.64s)]
*  and that's a blessing I hope for every one of you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=616.68s)]
*  You have that what's in front of you is just more exciting. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=619.92s)]
*  Well, that's great. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=623.4s)]
*  And Sujay, you're all about the dreams. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=624.68s)]
*  So between you, you've raised a huge amount of money for your fund, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  Wondeko, and it's focused very much on cyber security at a consumer level. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=631.68s)]
*  So I wondered whether speaking very practically, Sujay, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=637.72s)]
*  you're sitting in a room here full of people who care about cyber security, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=640.8s)]
*  the girls consumers, but they're also business leaders. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=644.56s)]
*  What are they not thinking about on that front? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=647.84s)]
*  What are they not thinking about on that front [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=650.68s)]
*  that you think they should be thinking about? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=653.28s)]
*  So first of all, thank you Emma for having us. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=656.9599999999999s)]
*  And everything Jeffrey said about himself, I see every day. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=659.28s)]
*  It's I've never seen someone who is so focused on building [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=662.4s)]
*  and not reminiscing in my entire life. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=667.1199999999999s)]
*  He's a remarkable person. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=668.52s)]
*  So I feel very lucky every day to get to work with him in that way. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=669.4s)]
*  So in terms of cyber security, here's a simple question. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=674.28s)]
*  How many of you let your employees use their own phones [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  or computers to get business done in some capacity? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  Most people, but not everyone, I'm surprised because [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  if they're not using their phones to make phone calls [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=689.76s)]
*  that are business related, I'd be shocked or text messages or WhatsApp [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=692.2399999999999s)]
*  or signal or whatever else. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=696.04s)]
*  And the interesting thing about that is [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=697.2399999999999s)]
*  unless you're in some sort of government regulated [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=701.64s)]
*  or defense industry kind of thing, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=705.76s)]
*  odds are whether you want them to or not, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  they're using personal devices to conduct business. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  Which means that as a business owner, you are almost as responsible [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  for protecting their devices as you are for protecting corporate devices [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  because business is happening on them whether you like it or not. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=721.84s)]
*  And so about in February 2019, we set out to create a company [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=725.72s)]
*  that would be this generation's one stop shop [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=732.04s)]
*  to help you protect yourself and your family online. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=735.96s)]
*  Over the next couple of years, it's become a leading product [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=738.88s)]
*  in allowing corporations to provide it for their employees [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=741.64s)]
*  so they can secure their personal devices. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=746.0s)]
*  Because most of us don't want corporate software [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=748.28s)]
*  sitting on our personal devices. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=751.2s)]
*  But they will take the best in class consumer software. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=752.96s)]
*  So since then, the business is hundreds of millions of revenue. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=756.04s)]
*  It's growing at almost 60% at the moment. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=759.28s)]
*  And I think our view is that it's one of the few areas [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=763.12s)]
*  where you've seen virtually no innovation in a couple decades. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=767.84s)]
*  And yet it's one of the big... [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=771.72s)]
*  Every year, it's like we're all being boiled like frogs, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=773.36s)]
*  So here's another question. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=777.08s)]
*  Who in this audience has actually had some kind of cyber of you personally [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=778.8s)]
*  where somebody has broken into, gotten a hold of you, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=789.12s)]
*  spammed you, raise your hand? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=793.28s)]
*  OK. Now, how many of you know somebody personally [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=796.6s)]
*  where that's happened to you? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=801.04s)]
*  It's everybody. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=803.72s)]
*  And that's the point. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=805.16s)]
*  I mean, this is an epidemic. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=806.48s)]
*  And to put in perspective for you, in 2003, in America, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=808.44s)]
*  there was $4.2 billion in robbery theft from residents, from homes. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  There was $10.5 billion of theft to individuals through cyber theft. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=825.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the interesting is, I think it's fascinating you said [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=834.88s)]
*  there's been so little innovation when clearly the threat is growing bigger [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=837.36s)]
*  and bigger. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=840.68s)]
*  What... Since you started and since you got into this field, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=841.56s)]
*  what changes have you noticed and what would you say are like the biggest [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=844.68s)]
*  threats that are coming down the line now? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=848.76s)]
*  I think I can guess what you're going to say, but go on. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=850.76s)]
*  Well, it's actually threats to children is what we worry the most about. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=854.84s)]
*  So I mean, some of the scams that are happening to children who are just [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=858.68s)]
*  getting smartphones are about as horrific a thing as you can imagine [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=863.72s)]
*  happening to a 13 or 14 or 15 year old. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=867.12s)]
*  So one of the more prevalent ones is someone will anonymously meet your [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=869.48s)]
*  child on Discord or somewhere else. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=873.84s)]
*  They will get into a quote unquote relationship. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=877.24s)]
*  Of course, you've never seen a picture of this person and they'll ask for [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=879.6s)]
*  rescape photos to be sent. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=882.36s)]
*  And for a 13 year old, it doesn't have to be a nude photo. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=884.44s)]
*  It can be anything provocative. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=887.6s)]
*  And then it turns out these people will then hit them and say, listen, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=889.88s)]
*  by the way, you now have to pay me $5,000 or I'll send this picture [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=892.6s)]
*  to everyone in your school. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=896.48s)]
*  And now for 13 or 14 or 15 year old, your life feels over. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=899.44s)]
*  So suicide. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, people are kidding. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  It's it's genuinely horrific what's happening to these kids. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=905.6s)]
*  And even less than that, I mean, you know, when I was growing up, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=909.1600000000001s)]
*  my parents knew what I was doing most of the time. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=913.2s)]
*  Right. I was on a landline sitting, talking to somebody or whatever it was. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=915.44s)]
*  Now they are these kids are living lives that are entirely [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=919.08s)]
*  completely disconnected from anything their parents understand about them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=923.08s)]
*  So do you have kids? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=926.6400000000001s)]
*  I do have three, but they're younger. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=927.96s)]
*  Right. What are the rules that you have for them? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=929.36s)]
*  Well, they're four, two and six months. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  I just want them to play with me. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=933.2s)]
*  It's great. Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=935.12s)]
*  Yeah. But but but it's what advice would you give to people [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=936.6s)]
*  who say, I've got, you know, kids between the ages of 10 and 18? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=940.6s)]
*  Look, the best thing you can do is if you can link up with all of their friends, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  families and almost have a no smartphone pact. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=948.24s)]
*  That's the only thing I've seen actually be effective. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=951.32s)]
*  If that doesn't happen, the social pressure on them to get a smart device, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=953.4000000000001s)]
*  to be, you know, on social media, everything else, it's it's [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  it's impossible for you to stand in the way of all their friends have it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=960.92s)]
*  And so what we're releasing actually in the next couple of weeks is version [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=964.12s)]
*  one of a of a product that allows you to actually monitor [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=967.92s)]
*  all the activity that's happening on your kids phones. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=973.0799999999999s)]
*  They're talking to new people on WhatsApp or Discord or Instagram [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  or TikTok or something like that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=979.92s)]
*  They're sleeping differently. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=981.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, they're on their phone at 2 a.m. now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=983.04s)]
*  There's probably some disruption in their life. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=984.88s)]
*  You know, there's a whole bunch of things that these devices can tell you. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=986.68s)]
*  As a parent, if you go back and you [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=989.52s)]
*  a couple of generations ago before these phones, 20 years ago as a parent, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=992.6s)]
*  you were able to observe behavior. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=998.92s)]
*  And and every kid goes through drinking, driving, sex, drugs. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1002.4s)]
*  Like these are the passages of life. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1007.68s)]
*  And as parents, when you actually had some information, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1010.1999999999999s)]
*  you were able to advise, guide and help them along that journey. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1014.68s)]
*  Our parents did for us. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1019.2s)]
*  We do for our for our kids. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1020.48s)]
*  What you said is, is today you have zero visibility [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1023.88s)]
*  and you don't know what's happening. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1027.8400000000001s)]
*  And so giving parents a tool [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1029.8s)]
*  that actually just allows them to have some access and again, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1033.2s)]
*  not take all of the freedom away because you're going to fail in that. Right. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1037.52s)]
*  That's the mission of of our of our cybersecurity. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1042.32s)]
*  In our alpha testing, if you were to survey parents [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1046.16s)]
*  about what they think their kids are doing versus what they actually end up doing, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1048.92s)]
*  it's unbelievable how different it is. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1053.48s)]
*  So 80 percent of girls, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1055.8000000000002s)]
*  18 years old and under, do not like their body. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1060.3200000000002s)]
*  And 20 percent of them are doing things that are from unhealthy [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1066.04s)]
*  to destructive as a result of that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1070.6000000000001s)]
*  As a parent, if you just had any inkling [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1074.72s)]
*  as to where and how down the rabbit hole they're going. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1078.12s)]
*  So let's give you a couple of examples. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  If your 15 year old daughter is downloading calorie tracking apps, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1082.32s)]
*  that's a pretty good indicator you have an eating disorder coming your way. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1087.24s)]
*  You know, those are the sorts of they're following [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1090.36s)]
*  only a certain type of fitness influencer on social media. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1092.56s)]
*  That's a pretty good sign you've got an eating disorder coming your way. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1096.48s)]
*  And it's not just kids. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1099.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you have elderly parents like I do, they're getting targeted [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1101.44s)]
*  with emails that apparently have written in my tone of voice, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1105.56s)]
*  which kid them into thinking that I'm genuinely asking them for money. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1108.3600000000001s)]
*  So what or has for your parents [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1112.04s)]
*  is something called delegation. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1116.2s)]
*  And so you can take your parents [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  online footprint and say anybody that is not in their contact, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1123.8400000000001s)]
*  either phone or email or text in this gets delegated to you [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1129.08s)]
*  or to somebody that you want. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1133.56s)]
*  And so they literally can't even get through that door because once they do, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1135.24s)]
*  it's you know, it's a disaster. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1140.8s)]
*  We have we have many of these features that are literature. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  You you give you name a problem and or has a feature [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1145.36s)]
*  to actually give you a tool to address it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1150.68s)]
*  That's the idea. We're working on it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not all done yet. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1155.48s)]
*  Can you say, perhaps you can give us a sense of the scale of the problem as well, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1156.52s)]
*  because presumably AI has sort of turbocharged this whole [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1160.36s)]
*  sort of cybersecurity threat. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1164.12s)]
*  It will turbocharge it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not right now. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1168.52s)]
*  The sophistication of these scams is already pretty effective [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1171.0s)]
*  at soaking money from all of us. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1173.76s)]
*  Money tends to be the core honeypot here. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1176.16s)]
*  But over time, I mean, the impersonation, the, you know, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1180.12s)]
*  and visual, you know, whether in photographs, videos, I mean, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1183.0s)]
*  I actually your jobs as journalists is about to get really difficult [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1185.8400000000001s)]
*  because what did people actually do? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1188.64s)]
*  What did people actually say? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be very hard to discern truth from fiction. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1192.04s)]
*  And again, I mean, just to bring politics back into it, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1195.28s)]
*  because obviously there's a lot of anxiety around how sort of cybersecurity [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1198.16s)]
*  threats or misinformation or, you know, interference generally around [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1202.48s)]
*  the election process. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1207.28s)]
*  Is that something that your your tools could help with? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1208.44s)]
*  No. Unfortunately, yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1212.92s)]
*  Too big a problem. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1216.44s)]
*  Well, that's state to state, you know, and that's just at a whole different level. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1218.04s)]
*  And it's enterprise focus. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1222.4s)]
*  It's just ours is trying to get every day [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  in your in your daily life for you, for your kids, for your parents. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1227.48s)]
*  It's a very different problem to solve. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1230.88s)]
*  The other is equally big and equally scary. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And also, you know, again, where it's [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1237.64s)]
*  there's government level things that need to be handled. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1240.04s)]
*  But I mean, most of us reuse passwords. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1241.96s)]
*  Yeah, we shouldn't. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1244.72s)]
*  But we do. We use the same passwords for personal and work, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1245.72s)]
*  which means that if any of our passwords get leaked personally, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1249.12s)]
*  you know, all of a sudden your business applications are at risk. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1253.32s)]
*  Those are the kinds of things we're really focused on right now. Right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1255.6799999999998s)]
*  I also wanted to I understand that you the two of you are about to branch out. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1260.2s)]
*  I want to do. But before you do that, just really kind of put in perspective, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1266.12s)]
*  I would say. For the U.S. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  probably the corporation that has the highest standard around security [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  and information security is Microsoft. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1281.32s)]
*  There's probably the most resources devoted to it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  To Sujay's point, they bought or our cybersecurity, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1290.52s)]
*  personal cybersecurity and give it to all of their employees. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1295.6799999999998s)]
*  So it is the first line of defense for the company [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1299.2s)]
*  that has probably got the best reputation and the most resources, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1302.48s)]
*  you know, in the area of security, both for the corporation. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1307.48s)]
*  But they saw that entry level as a vulnerability. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1311.0s)]
*  Good. OK, so I now want to turn to your new venture. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1316.04s)]
*  Which one of you would care to outline briefly what the new venture is? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1320.08s)]
*  Because it's, as I understand it, a very big departure, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1324.88s)]
*  certainly from your previous life as a Hollywood mobile [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  and certainly from cybersecurity. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1331.0s)]
*  And it is the ladies and gentlemen. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1333.24s)]
*  I'm going to let him do it because it's his idea. OK. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1335.84s)]
*  OK, well, let me. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1338.88s)]
*  So Jeffrey is one of the fittest people you can make. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1340.24s)]
*  He works out two hours and 15 minutes every day, seven days a week. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1344.4s)]
*  No matter where we are in the world, we can land in Hong Kong [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1347.72s)]
*  and he goes straight to the gym to crank out one hundred and twenty minute workout. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1350.68s)]
*  He it's it's wild. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1354.24s)]
*  At the same time, he is a little bit older than me, a couple of years older than me. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1356.32s)]
*  And it's it's our mission at Wonderco to keep him alive [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1359.8s)]
*  and in the in this permanent youthful state for as long as possible. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  So we're in the process of starting a company. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1367.56s)]
*  It actually kind of actually started. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1370.52s)]
*  Starts tomorrow, in a sense, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1373.2s)]
*  called Wonder Health, and the premise of it is all around. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1375.6399999999999s)]
*  Like, what does the fountain of youth look like from a scientific perspective? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1380.12s)]
*  You know, in the history of time, no matter how rich, famous or powerful you are, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1384.36s)]
*  everyone has been looking for this, you know, mystical fountain of youth. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1389.24s)]
*  And the consequence of that is virtually all of us are highly susceptible [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1394.04s)]
*  to snake oil salesmen, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1398.76s)]
*  Because they offer you these things that sound good anecdotally. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1401.0s)]
*  And over time, it always morphs into the form of a supplement. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1405.4s)]
*  That's a subscription. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1410.84s)]
*  But it's largely not founded in real science. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1412.08s)]
*  And so we actually set out on a mission to go and find in every longevity, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1417.0800000000002s)]
*  the catchall term, but in every area where you would want to be younger than you are. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1423.24s)]
*  You know, if you're 70, you want to be 40. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1429.0400000000002s)]
*  If you're playing with your grandkids, you want to play with them [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1430.5600000000002s)]
*  the way you play with your own children. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1432.96s)]
*  Who is the world's greatest or who are the world's greatest [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1435.48s)]
*  researchers in that field? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1438.4s)]
*  What is the actual state of the art from a scientific proof standpoint? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1440.8000000000002s)]
*  What are the hypotheses that may lead to proof over the course of conducting research? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1445.48s)]
*  And what is the world's greatest testing and diagnostics mechanism [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1451.84s)]
*  for those particular fields? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1456.84s)]
*  So we broke longevity into 34 arenas of identified, identified 58 [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1458.1200000000001s)]
*  founding scientists who are, I mean, you know, I'll give you one example. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1463.48s)]
*  There's Dr. Rudy Tansey is one of the world's greatest neuroscientists. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1468.64s)]
*  Time named him one of the hundred most influential people in the world. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1472.84s)]
*  He's published over 700 papers. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1476.0s)]
*  He studies brain degeneration. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  It turns out, you know, CEO, everybody is concerned. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1480.48s)]
*  And we all get older. We all start worrying. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1484.12s)]
*  Is our memory the way it was before? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1486.0s)]
*  Are we thinking as clearly? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1487.96s)]
*  But of course, you never want to admit that, especially if you're at a high power job. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1489.12s)]
*  And so a lot of what Dr. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1492.96s)]
*  Tansey has done is develop tools and research to figure out how do you [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1495.32s)]
*  improve neuromotor skills? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1500.16s)]
*  How do you reverse neuro degeneration? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1501.96s)]
*  How do you optimize someone's brain on certain dimensions? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1504.48s)]
*  One of the things that he's done, so he actually did a lot of the work [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1508.44s)]
*  with the NFL on CT, for example, is a fascinating guy. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1511.5600000000002s)]
*  So one of the tools he's developed is a VR, a VR capability [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1516.04s)]
*  that actually runs you through a set of exercises that has his research [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1520.3600000000001s)]
*  has proven can actually improve your brain function meaningfully, including as you age. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1524.92s)]
*  He's at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1530.2s)]
*  And so those are the kinds of things which are not widely available. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1533.04s)]
*  In fact, you probably never heard of it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1535.88s)]
*  I certainly hadn't before we started this project. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1537.8400000000001s)]
*  And so Wonder Health is just going to be every single tool [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1540.44s)]
*  that the world's greatest scientists think can identify issues [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1544.3600000000001s)]
*  and help you reverse any of them as quickly as possible. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1548.16s)]
*  OK, that all sounds great. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1550.92s)]
*  But I mean, Jeffrey, it's true that there is a lot of dubiousness [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  and skepticism around the whole idea of longevity. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1556.0s)]
*  You know, David Sinclair, the Harvard guy who was, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1559.48s)]
*  you know, widely discredited for promoting, you know, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1563.52s)]
*  ideas around longevity that didn't add up. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1567.8400000000001s)]
*  What is going to be your scientific sort of badge of your imprimatur of trust [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1570.16s)]
*  that this is proper science, that this isn't some kind of snake oil [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1575.64s)]
*  nonsense being marketed to extremely rich people [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1579.76s)]
*  who have not got better things to spend their money on? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1582.96s)]
*  I should say, wow. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1585.76s)]
*  So I'm just saying we've done a lot of hostility underlined. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1589.8s)]
*  Something's happened in your life, Emma, where you're just like, whoa, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1592.76s)]
*  what did David Sinclair do? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1597.1599999999999s)]
*  Because I can't afford your fee. That's OK. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1598.52s)]
*  Well, he told me what it was. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1601.08s)]
*  So I think Sujay actually just [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  explained it as precisely as you can, which is medicine. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1607.3999999999999s)]
*  If you think about medicine for all of us, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1611.04s)]
*  it is one to many, if not one to hundreds, if not one to tens of thousands, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1614.5200000000002s)]
*  depending on, you know, everybody here probably has got some access to, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1620.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, some, you know, higher end, you know, Mayo Clinic type [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1625.68s)]
*  access to be able to go in and look at your medical health. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1632.3600000000001s)]
*  We don't do that. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1638.1200000000001s)]
*  We're not in the detection of your medical health. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1639.8s)]
*  And so whether it's cancer or heart disease or diabetes or, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1643.6s)]
*  you know, the big four that we all have to pay attention to. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1649.3999999999999s)]
*  You mostly have concierge medicine. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1654.36s)]
*  I would think most of the people in this in this room do. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1657.44s)]
*  So one, we're not doing that. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1661.08s)]
*  And two, even for that, you are. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1663.8799999999999s)]
*  It's one to many, many, many. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1667.8s)]
*  Whereas what this is designed to do is actually be one to one [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1670.32s)]
*  about your specific need. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1675.84s)]
*  Wherever you have something that is either [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1679.0s)]
*  suboptimal or or a growing issue, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1683.28s)]
*  we can give you connection to these 58 scientists, the one most [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1687.84s)]
*  relevant to whatever your single issue is. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1693.48s)]
*  And and they are not practicing. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1696.76s)]
*  They're not out writing books. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1700.8s)]
*  They're not out doing studies in this. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1702.56s)]
*  They're in the lab and and and are on the cutting edge of it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1705.76s)]
*  And I think that is the thing that is certainly made me most excited about, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1710.2s)]
*  you know, being able if you have something where, you know, your your [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1714.72s)]
*  joints or your, you know, the calcium of your bones, whatever. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1719.76s)]
*  These are all they're literally people who have spent a lifetime studying [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1724.0s)]
*  just that. That's the person I want to hear from. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1728.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's what Wonder Health has gone out to do. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1732.16s)]
*  To put a fine point on it, I mean, they've all published this research. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1735.52s)]
*  It's not like it's proprietary to us. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1738.44s)]
*  This is all widely published. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1740.3600000000001s)]
*  These are all great scientists for a reason. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1742.3600000000001s)]
*  So have you both put yourselves through the process as it were? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1744.2s)]
*  I did. I did two weeks ago. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1747.3200000000002s)]
*  And what did you discover? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1749.48s)]
*  Actually fascinating stuff. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, so I only have 30 percent of the information back because [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1752.8s)]
*  70 percent of it literally needs two to four weeks to actually process [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1757.28s)]
*  and take all of the measurements. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1763.04s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with a different set of analytics around your blood. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1764.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. So all of that has to go out. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1769.72s)]
*  And there are there are literally 600 tests that are done about that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1771.52s)]
*  There are other pieces of it that just need to be mapped out. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1776.84s)]
*  So I've only had 30 percent of the output from it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1780.2s)]
*  But he was just like, like, is one little thing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1783.8400000000001s)]
*  So I didn't say anything to them. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1786.1200000000001s)]
*  So I did it two weeks ago and I'm waiting. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1788.8s)]
*  He's doing it tomorrow. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1791.0s)]
*  So I had to go before him. It's his idea. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1792.8s)]
*  There's a 15000 square foot. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1795.76s)]
*  Beautiful. I mean, beautiful facility down here in the meatpacking district. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1798.76s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's it's gorgeous. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1804.88s)]
*  And the process and the people there, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1807.28s)]
*  they're all a plus. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1809.64s)]
*  So I was blown away by it. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1810.96s)]
*  As I said, I didn't I knew what he was doing, but I had not, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1813.64s)]
*  you know, sort of been part of the building of this. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1817.44s)]
*  So I am probably a bit of a gym rat. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1820.76s)]
*  And I had noticed some photographs in the last couple of months [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1825.5200000000002s)]
*  in which my posture. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1830.4s)]
*  They see my posture. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1834.44s)]
*  Just I don't know, didn't look like I just felt like I just might. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  I have lost sort of love. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1841.52s)]
*  And I I didn't say anything to them. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1844.0s)]
*  They went and they did all of these things around bone density [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1845.92s)]
*  and about joints and muscle measurements and all of that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1848.64s)]
*  And they put a chart up. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1852.92s)]
*  And in each of my joints, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1855.04s)]
*  there's a metric against my age. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1858.68s)]
*  I'm 73 years old. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1861.24s)]
*  So at 73 years old, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1862.52s)]
*  this is what conditions you should they would measure against. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1865.0s)]
*  So my ankles, which, you know, from a stability standpoint, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1869.04s)]
*  everything else is like this are really important in it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1872.52s)]
*  That was 100 percent. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1875.36s)]
*  Well, OK, that's good. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1877.16s)]
*  And we got to my knees. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1878.32s)]
*  One was 85 percent. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1879.8s)]
*  One was 70 percent. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1882.2s)]
*  And interestingly, up on that chart goes these two numbers [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1884.52s)]
*  against my joints and my shoulder blades. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1889.08s)]
*  30 percent. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1892.8s)]
*  So it nailed it. And then. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1895.0800000000002s)]
*  Literally, expert in this field came back and said, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1898.8s)]
*  Listen, the good news about that is it's it's not degenerative. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1902.88s)]
*  And you actually can hear are three exercises that you can do. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1907.48s)]
*  They were not they're not going to change my. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1913.04s)]
*  My routine, you know, routine is the hardest thing in the world, right? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1916.28s)]
*  Changing anything in routine is. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1919.76s)]
*  These are three things that I could do that he said six, eight weeks. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1921.92s)]
*  You will see a difference. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1927.28s)]
*  And it's about tightening the muscles. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1928.8400000000001s)]
*  Going to say, do you want to give us a demo? I'm sorry. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1930.3200000000002s)]
*  So that's just a teeny little thing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1934.64s)]
*  And I went, wow, you know, that was really helpful. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1937.28s)]
*  And another was just another. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1941.04s)]
*  My stability was not quite what it's meant to be. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1942.88s)]
*  And he said, OK, from now on. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1946.52s)]
*  When you brush your teeth, do this, see, I'm not quite stable enough. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1950.44s)]
*  You ought to be able to do this for 30 seconds. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1954.64s)]
*  I was told to stand on one leg. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1958.64s)]
*  Maybe I'm going to get the 30s. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1960.52s)]
*  I always thought you had to stand on one leg while you brush your teeth. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1961.6000000000001s)]
*  So maybe, but you don't have the issue I have. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1966.48s)]
*  So but he just said, if you do that every morning, every night, just [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1969.52s)]
*  you will see you'll strengthen your core. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1975.44s)]
*  What's the thing that happens if the disease doesn't get you? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1978.52s)]
*  You know what the next one is? A fall. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1981.0s)]
*  Like that's probably more problematic. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1984.72s)]
*  There's more of that as sort of the beginning of the end is, is you take a fall somewhere. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1987.56s)]
*  So having good stability is actually an interesting thing. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1992.76s)]
*  These things are all tiny little things, but they add up to. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1995.1999999999998s)]
*  How can you live better longer? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=1999.8s)]
*  That's the mission. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2004.72s)]
*  So let me ask then, maybe I was a bit flippant earlier. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2005.84s)]
*  Who's your target audience? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2008.52s)]
*  Who's your target customer for this service? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2010.28s)]
*  Well, I'll give you the short term and the long term. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2013.52s)]
*  The short term, the truth is, it's the least scalable thing we've ever done. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2015.2s)]
*  The these scientists are extraordinarily busy. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2019.72s)]
*  Surely it's a scalable business. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2022.52s)]
*  Well, the goal, the goal is to make it scalable. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2024.44s)]
*  So originally we would have just looked for an investment in a scalable company. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2027.44s)]
*  We just couldn't find something. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2030.76s)]
*  This is why we created this. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2031.6s)]
*  And we're starting with something that will be a very small membership. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2033.0s)]
*  And so it's it's going to be a range of people, but it's Jeffrey's friend circle. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2038.48s)]
*  And and then over time, the goal is to figure out which of these [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2043.72s)]
*  things appear to be more common than others. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2049.16s)]
*  And is there a mass market product that we can create [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2051.72s)]
*  and then distribute in a standard way? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2054.6s)]
*  So that's what it really ends up being in an interesting way, almost a laboratory, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2056.84s)]
*  a functioning laboratory that is a profitable, successful business for us. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2062.0800000000004s)]
*  But the real outcome is we I'm certain that we are going to deliver. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  We are going to discover best practices. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2071.4s)]
*  We are going to because we're getting access to the newest tech around these things. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2074.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I took a couple of these tests and things they did with me. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2081.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I've never had anything even wrote remotely close to them. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2084.6800000000003s)]
*  And they were fascinating about reflex and measuring brain response and, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2087.36s)]
*  you know, eye coordination and stuff. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2093.32s)]
*  It was like, wow, I'm certain those things will find their way into a consumer. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2095.6400000000003s)]
*  And we will we'll be on the edge of that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2102.04s)]
*  So, you know, I think there is something big on the horizon, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2104.88s)]
*  but it starts with first make this great. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2109.4s)]
*  OK, well, look, politics, cybersecurity, longevity, I feel it's all makes sense. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2113.4s)]
*  It all makes sense. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2120.0s)]
*  And I feel it's time to hand over to the audience for questions [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2121.64s)]
*  on any one of these topics or indeed anything else. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2125.7200000000003s)]
*  They want to go home. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2131.84s)]
*  No questions. Oh, yes, there are a tentative one here. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2135.96s)]
*  I'm Jason Peterson, ECO Digital. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2140.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm I'm similarly into the types of things that you're talking about [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2144.0s)]
*  with regard to longevity. We spoke about earlier. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2148.08s)]
*  I'm curious if in going through the process of setting up this laboratory, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2152.28s)]
*  if you've come across standardized methods to measure, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2156.96s)]
*  to your point about fall risk, things like stability, mobility, proprioception. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2162.32s)]
*  And if maybe that's a way to scale or one of these scalable components [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2167.16s)]
*  in terms of diagnosing people's [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2171.8399999999997s)]
*  fall risk and providing correct measure. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2175.12s)]
*  I think in general, one of the reason, one of the reasons that [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2179.7599999999998s)]
*  this is a hard field is because every single human is different. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2184.7999999999997s)]
*  And so it's it's really easy to oversimplify this stuff [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2189.3199999999997s)]
*  and give and lead people in the wrong direction. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2192.8399999999997s)]
*  I'll give you another example of [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2195.16s)]
*  of one of the areas of science that we've been studying, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2198.12s)]
*  which is red light therapy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2200.48s)]
*  It turns out there's a lot of great benefits of red light therapy. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2202.7599999999998s)]
*  However, every single person has a different interaction model with it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2205.96s)]
*  And so anything generic that's provided [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2212.6s)]
*  may have an effect on you, but also may not have an effect on you. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2215.72s)]
*  So one of the things that one of our scientists has has pioneered [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2218.72s)]
*  is that everyone who goes through this actually takes a saliva test. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2223.16s)]
*  And then we send that sample to his lab [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2226.68s)]
*  and he then comes up with a custom red light therapy model [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2229.52s)]
*  for folks that go through this. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, like, so I actually think what we need to figure out how to do [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2234.6s)]
*  is how do we make accessible the personalization part [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2238.12s)]
*  as opposed to providing standards, which may or may not be relevant [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2242.2s)]
*  to any given person, because everybody's different. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2245.88s)]
*  There's another question here. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2249.7200000000003s)]
*  Are you looking at alternative medicine into this mix as well? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2253.16s)]
*  Like, our goal is to be as scientifically comprehensive as we can be. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2262.08s)]
*  So as long as something has been validated [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2266.32s)]
*  through clinical trials and other kind of published research, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2269.36s)]
*  we're excited to bring that into this. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2273.6s)]
*  But what we won't do is [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2276.16s)]
*  things that sound good that may not have that basis. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2279.6s)]
*  In fact, what was the one that I sent you today? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2282.2s)]
*  The article was in The Times about the remisin. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2285.0s)]
*  What's the drug? Oh, is this resveratrol? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2288.4s)]
*  No. Yeah. Is it? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2291.16s)]
*  Is that the one you're talking about? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2292.56s)]
*  Which one? Is it rapamycin? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2294.44s)]
*  Yeah. What would rapamycin, which is a perfect example of something that [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2296.16s)]
*  there is no real proof of concept yet. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2301.56s)]
*  And yet there is no real proof of concept. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2304.88s)]
*  And yet there are people that think that it's actually effective. Right. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2307.3999999999996s)]
*  So I just was in The New York Times today. I read it. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2311.08s)]
*  Not the Wall Street Journal. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2313.56s)]
*  A lot of times things will be effective. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2315.04s)]
*  If it was the Wall Street Journal, I would believe it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2319.48s)]
*  This is on the record, Jeffrey. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2320.48s)]
*  I mean, a lot of times what happens is there is something that has a positive effect. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2322.64s)]
*  But there are tons of negative effects for any given individual. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2327.04s)]
*  And, you know, again, we all get seduced by the prospect of something getting better. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2330.68s)]
*  And so it's so easy to to shortcut the science. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2334.76s)]
*  And that's that's what we're like religious about in this case is [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2339.6800000000003s)]
*  if it comes from the scientists, if it's backed by credible published research, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2343.96s)]
*  that's something that we will include. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  And if it's not, it goes in our list of TBD. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2351.28s)]
*  And by the way, a big project here is that we will push a lot of the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2355.2000000000003s)]
*  revenue back into research projects and help us to get the best out of it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2359.76s)]
*  And we will help fund the scientists doing work so that they don't spend [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2364.76s)]
*  all their time writing grants to the NIH and instead can just get on with it. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2367.7200000000003s)]
*  All right. There is one more question here. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2371.84s)]
*  As somebody who has now no longer has little kids, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2375.0s)]
*  but now has to worry about older parents, was curious, do you see banks [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2378.6800000000003s)]
*  adopting any of the models in terms of being able to set [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2383.5600000000004s)]
*  levels where they your parents can pay up to two hundred dollars, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2387.6400000000003s)]
*  can't pay over that without a second approval? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2393.28s)]
*  Because right now it seems all on the the the families to deal with that. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2395.96s)]
*  And it seems like that should be basic capabilities that banks have [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2402.32s)]
*  so that you can go in there, set the levels that parents don't wind up [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2407.04s)]
*  giving away the family fortune without the kids or other people being alerted. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2412.76s)]
*  And so well, so there's two separate things. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2418.0s)]
*  One is the alerting model. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2420.88s)]
*  That's we already we already do that. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2422.96s)]
*  So that part's there and exists. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2424.2000000000003s)]
*  The limits, my understanding, and I could be wrong about this, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2427.6800000000003s)]
*  is that most banks do allow you to set a limit for yourself. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2430.56s)]
*  But, you know, like you also have to worry about the fraud side of children [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2434.6s)]
*  taking advantage of their elderly parents. Right. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2438.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think I think banks have that issue to deal with from [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2439.88s)]
*  from whatever their kind of own internal compliance model is, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2444.04s)]
*  is who gets to set those rules. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2446.84s)]
*  But you can I mean, you can if you go to an ATM, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2448.32s)]
*  you're usually capped by some withdrawal limit [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2450.56s)]
*  that you may or may not want, depending on where you are. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2453.4s)]
*  Yeah. But I know like my dad has walked in and, you know, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2456.56s)]
*  your son is in jail. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2460.1200000000003s)]
*  You need to say that happens all the time. Right. I mean, that like. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2462.0800000000004s)]
*  I think you can do things like effectively the banking version [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2466.76s)]
*  of two factor authentication where two people need to authorize something. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2469.84s)]
*  There are versions of these models that are out there. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2473.88s)]
*  OK, well, look, I'm going to wrap this up by bringing us briefly back to politics. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2477.04s)]
*  I'm just shocked. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2482.9599999999996s)]
*  Jeffy, it's easy. I just want to know what advice would you give [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2484.3999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris? It's obviously a very close election. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2488.56s)]
*  There's, you know, a lot of been a lot of complaints [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2492.4399999999996s)]
*  that she hasn't set out her stall on the economic front. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2494.3199999999997s)]
*  What would your advice to her be? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2497.4399999999996s)]
*  Stay the course and do exactly what she's doing. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2499.72s)]
*  Yes, voters. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2503.24s)]
*  Want to and have a right to know. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2505.4s)]
*  I think that she is [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2510.08s)]
*  working as diligently and as quickly as she can [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2513.48s)]
*  to both run a campaign and be thoughtful [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2518.56s)]
*  about responding to these [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2522.96s)]
*  you know, real [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2528.16s)]
*  policy questions that people want to know. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2530.64s)]
*  But this expectation [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2533.36s)]
*  that someone who was never thinking they were going to be a candidate [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2535.96s)]
*  as vice president, this was not their responsibility to establish policy. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2542.2000000000003s)]
*  As a vice president, you don't actually have the resources [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2547.6s)]
*  to be able to go out and build out policies. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2551.88s)]
*  And she has been fiercely [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2555.7200000000003s)]
*  admirable and very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2559.88s)]
*  very, terribly loyal to Joe Biden [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2563.8s)]
*  and his policies, what she has followed, loyally. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2567.88s)]
*  So to have her [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2572.56s)]
*  off the cuff while preparing for a debate, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2576.0800000000004s)]
*  while running around the country while running, you know, raising money, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2580.04s)]
*  all the things that she has to legitimately do as a candidate [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2583.7200000000003s)]
*  to expect that she's going to stop. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2587.56s)]
*  If it were your job today to set out a policy around taxation for the next administration, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2589.28s)]
*  can you do that in a day, do you think? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2601.1600000000003s)]
*  Two days? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2604.2000000000003s)]
*  A week? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2605.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, how much time would you need to be able to sit around with experts to get [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2606.2000000000003s)]
*  get input, to evaluate those things, and then to set a policy around it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2613.84s)]
*  So I just, that's how you can't wing it. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2621.2400000000002s)]
*  You can't just like, oh, here's, you know, I'll do, well, Donald Trump wings it every [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  day, so I guess you can. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2629.8s)]
*  But I don't think that's, I don't think that's who she is. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I know there's a little bit of frustration about it. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2637.5s)]
*  She's actually going to talk about the economy tomorrow and commerce. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2640.6s)]
*  She's making a trip to Arizona on Friday. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2646.44s)]
*  So you know, that thing of, you know, you got to, she's having to do multiple jobs at [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2649.08s)]
*  the same time. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2657.24s)]
*  And we've never had in modern times a candidate that has had less time to become a candidate [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2658.7999999999997s)]
*  and to formulate all of those things that are going to be important. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2667.2999999999997s)]
*  And so for me, most importantly, I think, by the way, not, not excusing anything, but [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2671.3799999999997s)]
*  for me, at every single candidate I have ever supported, and I've done it on both sides, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2678.5s)]
*  both Republican and Democrat, the thing I put above all else is character. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2683.58s)]
*  That ultimately is the thing that I value the most and look to the most, which is what's [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2689.8199999999997s)]
*  their North Star? What are their values? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2696.34s)]
*  And because you could go through and actually look at every single presidency, certainly [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2699.38s)]
*  in the last 100 years, and look during their presidency, what was the moment? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2707.5s)]
*  What was the thing that actually challenged them the most in their presidency? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2713.1400000000003s)]
*  And I promise you, I can actually go through it and tell you, did Donald Trump have any [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2718.34s)]
*  time to prepare for a pandemic? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2721.98s)]
*  Was that on the horizon? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2723.5800000000004s)]
*  Was that something that he had a policy about? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2724.94s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2727.38s)]
*  Did George Bush have it around 9 11? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2729.1000000000004s)]
*  Like I can go through every president, just say, well, what prepared, you know, what [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2731.26s)]
*  prepared him to suddenly become a leader in that moment in time, you know, when these [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2735.38s)]
*  two buildings were taken down here? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2741.42s)]
*  So to me, it is character above all else. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2743.42s)]
*  And in that regard, and I've known the vice president for 20 years, 10 out of 10, she [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2747.98s)]
*  is, again, I think a very good, very generous heart. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2753.82s)]
*  And I mean that in the best way and smart. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H90HY-lGraw&t=2761.06s)]
