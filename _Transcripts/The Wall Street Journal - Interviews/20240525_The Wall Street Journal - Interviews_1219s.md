# OnlyFans CEO Keily Blair on Why the Company Doesn't Track Inbound Traffic | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE)
*  So I figured we'd just get started real quick right into some of the meat of a social media conversation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=0.0s)]
*  What would you say is the secret to appealing to only fans recommendation system? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=8.28s)]
*  So Jeff, we don't have a personalized recommendation system on only fans. Okay [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=12.96s)]
*  What's your roadmap for incorporating generative AI? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=18.78s)]
*  Into the platform so we don't allow AI generated content creators [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=22.2s)]
*  Creators can use AI to enhance their own content, but no holy I AI accounts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=27.42s)]
*  What's your plan to increase? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=32.74s)]
*  Time spent that paramount growth metric for every social media company [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=35.18s)]
*  So unlike many other social media companies, that's actually not an important growth metric for us [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=39.82s)]
*  What's your biggest source of inbound traffic? I don't know we don't track it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=45.46s)]
*  So, how did you get this job? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=51.46s)]
*  You must have a really formidable background in growth hacking, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=54.02s)]
*  Actually unusually for a tech company CEO [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=60.14s)]
*  I have a background in law and I specialized in cybersecurity [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=62.78s)]
*  Privacy and trust and safety which may explain the answers to some of those questions and you're sure you run a social media company [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=66.9s)]
*  Absolutely. Okay [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=72.98s)]
*  so [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=74.48s)]
*  Everyone meet Keeley [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=76.26s)]
*  Only fans has well over 300 million users at this point [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=78.38s)]
*  well over 3 million creators and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=83.58s)]
*  only about half of which are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=87.06s)]
*  In the adult space, correct? Well again, Jeff, we don't track that either [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=89.62s)]
*  But you guys have suggested you think you're around there most of the revenue though, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=94.58s)]
*  I think the really interesting space thing about only fans is that we are a space for grown-ups to have grown-up content experiences [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=98.5s)]
*  Sometimes that will include adult content [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=106.42s)]
*  But often it can include sport comedy marks mixed martial arts [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=108.22s)]
*  Basically anywhere where a creator wants to monetize a fan base as long as they keep with our terms of service [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=112.14s)]
*  Okay, and so I think this is me [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=116.98s)]
*  probably where we should start because I [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=120.34s)]
*  Well, you know, I am feigning my [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=123.66s)]
*  Surprise at those opening questions. It actually is kind of hard to grasp after five years of covering Instagram and Facebook that this is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=127.62s)]
*  Not just a business but a very good business you guys [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  Billion dollars in revenue that was a couple years back and by all accounts still growing and a gross margin in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=142.14s)]
*  50% more or less range [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=149.9s)]
*  and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  There's just some of the stuff just seems so counterintuitive. I mean why why would [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  say [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  Only fans not have on platform [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  Recommendations to help people discover accounts that are popular with people that behave like them like this is the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=162.82s)]
*  like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=168.5s)]
*  This is the bread and butter of every social media platform of the sort of advertising driven model [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's the key right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  It's the advertising driven model that means that social media platforms are often structured in that way [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  So unlike a lot of those other platforms [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=183.61999999999998s)]
*  We have an alignment of interest with our creator community we only succeed where our creators succeed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=186.38s)]
*  So one of the stats that you didn't mention which I'm incredibly proud of is that we've paid out over 15 billion to creators [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=192.34s)]
*  Since we were founded and our business model means that for every dollar we are and creators earn for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  And [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=205.18s)]
*  So if you might not be looking to mimic the mainstream ad [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=206.18s)]
*  Advertising based social media platform business models. I probably can't say the reverse in the last couple of years. We've seen [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=210.9s)]
*  tik-tok Google Shorts [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=218.62s)]
*  Certainly Instagram and Facebook really go in heavy on subscription [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=222.78s)]
*  And direct creator payments not coincidentally at the same time. They are cutting their creator [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=228.22s)]
*  Sort of payout budgets [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=234.74s)]
*  I [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=236.78s)]
*  Would be very curious about your read as to first of all what that competition looks like and second of all [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=237.9s)]
*  What a platform that is making the jump into [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=247.1s)]
*  your models approach [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  Would need to think about in terms of trust and safety [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=253.94s)]
*  Yes, so there's two parts to that question [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=257.18s)]
*  So I guess the first part is the other platforms essentially copying the only fans model, right in terms of allowing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=259.22s)]
*  Subscriptions and some degree of creator monetization, although typically not as generous of revenue split [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=267.17999999999995s)]
*  I think creators are demanding more [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=271.85999999999996s)]
*  user generated content if you look at how Gen Z and you know younger adults are are dealing and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  Engaging with media content there. They want to engage with creators [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  They want creators to be fairly paid to be fairly remunerated for the content that they create and they should own that content as well [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=286.5s)]
*  So again, one of the key differentiators for us is when a creator puts content on our platform [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=293.1s)]
*  They remain the copyright owner, right? It's theirs. They can take it off the platform at any point [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=297.62s)]
*  It doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the content creator [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  In terms of the other platforms, I can absolutely see why and it's obviously an additional revenue stream [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=304.74s)]
*  If you've got ad revenue alongside that but the difficulty I think in then transitioning users is only fans has always had that model [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  With there was always an expectation that you were going to pay to access content [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=316.98s)]
*  We didn't switch it up there was no great switch rule that happened for the users or the creators [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=320.82s)]
*  It was always the business plan [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=325.62s)]
*  And I think the difficulty that other platforms have is that when people have been receiving content for free for so long [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=326.94s)]
*  It can be hard for users to then transition and they need to feel that it's exclusive content [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=332.62s)]
*  They need to feel like they're getting more [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=337.34s)]
*  I think that's the challenge for other platforms when they start thinking about adopting a subscription model [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=338.54s)]
*  The other really interesting thing and that we've noticed in terms of trends in the creator economy and in the business in general [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=343.5s)]
*  Is that actually revenue from subscriptions now makes up a smaller proportion of our revenue than revenue from microtransactions [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=349.3s)]
*  so microtransactions are paid to unlock content and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=357.22s)]
*  individual messaging custom messages exclusive behind-the-scenes footage that you can access and open when you subscribe to a creator [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=360.94s)]
*  So it's really interesting to see that degree of user choice coming into it again, right as a user and a consumer [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=367.94s)]
*  Sometimes I get a bit tired of having like 10 subscriptions to all the things when really I just want to watch one thing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=373.62s)]
*  And so giving users and creators the freedom to monetize their content using different models subscriptions and microtransactions alongside each other [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=379.3s)]
*  It's very important [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=386.94s)]
*  Second part of your question was about trust and safety [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=388.98s)]
*  That is fundamental to how we operate at only fans [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=391.98s)]
*  We don't have a license to operate unless it's something that we take incredibly seriously and we start [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=395.94s)]
*  By looking at the creator onboarding journey that for me is the most important thing to get right [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=401.98s)]
*  And the reason why is because creators are the only people on the platform who can share and monetize content fans are subscribers [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=406.9s)]
*  They subscribe to the content they can't share and monetize it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  But for creators they have to go through an incredibly stringent onboarding process [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=415.7s)]
*  They have to provide us with nine different pieces of information about themselves and in lots of jurisdictions ten including in the US where you've got [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  To give your social security number. We're talking government issued ID [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=426.62s)]
*  Full name bank account details your other social media handles so we can check that you're Jeff on all the other platforms as well as Jeff [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  on only fans and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=437.61999999999995s)]
*  We then don't monetize that data [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  We use that data simply to keep our community safe, but also to create accountability [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=441.58s)]
*  And in in this is an issue that's come up for a lot of other platforms in countries where there [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=446.14s)]
*  Aren't let's say reliable records [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=455.14s)]
*  That's tricky and in countries where actually we're not able to verify somebody's identity [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=457.06s)]
*  We choose not to operate in those in those areas [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  We have to have certainty that we know the age and identity of our creators before they join the platform [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=464.14s)]
*  Particularly if they are going to be have the ability to share adult content if they choose to do so [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=469.34s)]
*  Yeah, this was I mean the way I ended up pitching this panel to the journal was I was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=473.18s)]
*  Looking at Metta's subscription products you could buy [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=479.58s)]
*  Pay for subscriptions to people's children child models [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=483.74s)]
*  and the recommendation issues there were unfortunately recommending those accounts to people who had a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=488.02s)]
*  Very high score on an internal metric that was [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=495.46s)]
*  said to describe suspicious behavior toward children, right and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=500.38s)]
*  Obviously you guys do not allow [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=506.82s)]
*  Miners on the platform as either creators or not if there is a photo in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=508.86s)]
*  Let's say let's say I am a creator and I have a photo of my kid that I want to show my fans [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=514.74s)]
*  How's that gonna go for me? It's not gonna go well, okay? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=519.22s)]
*  And and let's say let's say just as a matter of fantasy [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=522.14s)]
*  I you know, I want to appear in my only fans accounts as a in a schoolgirl outfit [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=525.8199999999999s)]
*  How's that gonna go for me? So we don't allow age-related role play either Jeff and like that's fundamental to me [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=531.1s)]
*  I've got two children. They're nine and eleven. I want them to have age-appropriate experiences online [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=537.58s)]
*  It's incredibly important that we do that as social media platforms that we recognize [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=543.38s)]
*  We have to cater to our user group and we have to have safety controls in place [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=547.72s)]
*  That cater to that and recognize the risks that are inherent in each of the different platform models [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  That's why for us because we know that everyone's over 18 on our platform and we're confident on that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=556.0600000000001s)]
*  We but we do allow adult content. We have different risks that we have to cater for so we have to invest very heavily in content [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=561.5400000000001s)]
*  Moderation. It's a reason why we don't have end-to-end encryption on our platform even in the direct messages [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=567.12s)]
*  And it means that we're able to really focus on keeping the community safe and keeping the community as for adults only [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=572.8s)]
*  I did want to ask you to change subjects about [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=579.88s)]
*  OnlyFans TV which [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=584.68s)]
*  For anyone looking for free content free NSFW content. It's going to be a disappointment, but but but like [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=587.84s)]
*  This is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=597.12s)]
*  This is something that only fans has been investing in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=598.68s)]
*  There are no ads and as best I can tell there are no plans to monetize [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=602.2s)]
*  Why do you why why is this a thing that you bother doing? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think you know when we first started looking at FTV. That was a question everybody asked [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=612.52s)]
*  They were like, oh, well, this is this is it. They're gonna they're gonna do ads [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=617.8s)]
*  It's gonna start happening or they're gonna start monetizing this content in a different way [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=620.24s)]
*  And actually for us again, it's about aligned incentives with our creators, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=624.98s)]
*  That's our North Star and so FTV because we don't have site-wide discoverability. You can't search on only fans for a topic [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=629.66s)]
*  So what FTV does it allows our creators to connect with new audiences entirely safe for work? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=636.66s)]
*  On over on on a variety of different channels. We have 44 million views on FTV [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=642.42s)]
*  Last month and we actually licensed some of TV content to Netflix in the UK [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=647.54s)]
*  One of our original series that we co-created one of our creators and so for us it's again [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=652.24s)]
*  It's that thing about how do we provide better opportunities for creators? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=657.6s)]
*  Not how do we squeeze another dollar out of a user? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=661.0600000000001s)]
*  I did one on terms of these sort of counterintuitive business choices [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=666.16s)]
*  This is one I actually am thoroughly confused on [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=672.84s)]
*  Chat bots obviously with generative AI it may not be that great at many things right now [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=676.4s)]
*  But it's reasonably good at carrying on a low-end conversation and I would I would imagine that it would be very easy [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=681.48s)]
*  to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=688.64s)]
*  Yes, obviously a big part of the business in addition to subscriptions is sort of add-on some of those include talking to creators [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=689.84s)]
*  I don't think it's a great secret that people have customer very popular creators have customer support staff [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=696.64s)]
*  Really does seem like you could just you know train a bot to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=702.9s)]
*  impersonate a particular creator and just let it go and that would be a lot of money for saved [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=708.18s)]
*  Why are you guys not allowing that? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=714.98s)]
*  So again, I you said low-end conversations [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=717.34s)]
*  There's some very intellectual discussions happening on only fans and chat bot may not be able to deal with that just you know [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=720.66s)]
*  But putting putting putting that part aside [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=726.38s)]
*  I think when we look at what gen I gen AI is doing right now [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=729.06s)]
*  There are a lot of risks associated with that this here comes the lawyer bit again, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=734.14s)]
*  And a lot of a lot of sessions I've sat in on in this conference [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=737.78s)]
*  I've talked about what the future looks like for gen AI and so there's like torment nexus doomsday scenarios [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=742.12s)]
*  How do we prevent that from happening? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=748.28s)]
*  But they're not dealing with some of the issues that exist right now with AI like copyright [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=749.86s)]
*  attribution [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=756.06s)]
*  Artistic integrity all of those other things. I mean there was some people got a little bit of trouble this week about you know [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=757.42s)]
*  It's a voice likeness [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=762.5799999999999s)]
*  for example being used and [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=764.5799999999999s)]
*  And until those issues are solved and they're right now issues. They're not doomsday scenario issues [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=767.26s)]
*  They're right now content scraping bad for creators issues [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=772.14s)]
*  There's a real risk in terms of actually just [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=776.26s)]
*  Allowing that to run free in the system [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=780.56s)]
*  And so for us when we think about how we allow creators to use gen AI on the platform [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=782.42s)]
*  We do allow creators to use it to enhance their content, but it needs to clearly be them [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=786.9399999999999s)]
*  It needs to clearly belong to them and need to be able to show us that we need to have confidence in that [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=791.1s)]
*  That's not the case with gen AI content. We simply don't have the confidence in its [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=795.98s)]
*  Authenticity and its its provenance [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=801.38s)]
*  I mean with so, you know meta has unleashed bots that occasionally pretend to be parents of children in the New York public schools [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=803.54s)]
*  When things go weird, are you saying that you will never? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=812.34s)]
*  allow genitive AI for [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=816.1s)]
*  for content and for communications and kind of the synthetic social network thing or or just that right now the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=818.66s)]
*  Risk reward is off right now. The risk reward is off as far as we can see it [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=825.7s)]
*  But we continue to look at it. You we don't I don't have a crystal ball. It'd be great if I did [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=830.94s)]
*  I mean the people wonderful, but I don't and [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=835.62s)]
*  The pace of change is is rapid and so I think for us [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=838.14s)]
*  We have a working group of lawyers privacy experts [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=842.38s)]
*  technologists developers who are looking at what is available out there and how it can help our greater community and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=846.46s)]
*  If there comes a time when it is the right thing to do and we are confident about the safeguards [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=852.7s)]
*  It's something we'll explore but right now as things currently stand, it's not right for us [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  So I think you've been pretty public about a distaste for [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=861.62s)]
*  Some of the recommendation driven platforms [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=868.34s)]
*  At the same time that you are sort of holding this model out separately though, it does seem like [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=871.62s)]
*  Successful only fans creators are almost uniformly also successful [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=878.78s)]
*  creators on Instagram Twitter YouTube and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=885.02s)]
*  I guess I am wondering [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=889.62s)]
*  How you see that symbiosis and also if they're not [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=893.74s)]
*  How you see that symbiosis and also if there is a if your business is [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=897.74s)]
*  to some degree dependent on a [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=904.14s)]
*  Model that you know, you don't seem particularly enchanted by to work. I [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=908.02s)]
*  Think for us it's the create each creator is their own business [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=913.94s)]
*  Essentially, we're a platform that facilitates those creator connections with their fans [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=918.7s)]
*  There is a really interesting report by Kajabi which basically said that most creators operate on [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=922.66s)]
*  I think seven plus platforms and they provide different content to different audiences on those platforms [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=927.0999999999999s)]
*  It would be very interesting to see what would happen if the other social media platforms completely changed how [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=934.62s)]
*  creators interact with fans and followers on those platforms and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=940.42s)]
*  And if that had a negative impact on the creators in fact in my benefit as they may end up more people may end up [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=944.26s)]
*  Coming to only fans on that basis [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=950.02s)]
*  Assuming, of course, they're over 18 and get through all the checks [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=952.3399999999999s)]
*  But I think for us it's it's really it's hard to say but there is a degree of symbiosis [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=955.5799999999999s)]
*  Because it's all about the creator and about them and their fan base [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=960.3399999999999s)]
*  But we still have to have the safeguards in place and control what we can control on our platform and for us [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=964.8599999999999s)]
*  Allowing users to have choice and allowing users to choose every single subscription and pick each creator [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=970.9399999999999s)]
*  They subscribe to is very important because as a fan, I'm not a fan of everything. I'm a fan of some things [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=978.06s)]
*  I'm a fan of some people. I like some musicians. I like some journalists and it's not all journalists everywhere [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=983.9s)]
*  You know, I like you you're fine [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=989.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, but it's it's it's it's that's that's true. That's true of all of our human experiences [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=992.22s)]
*  And sometimes we don't just want to be [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=998.14s)]
*  Pushed up. We don't want the push notifications [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1000.9399999999999s)]
*  We want to have choice we want to have control and agency and our creators want control and agency to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1004.22s)]
*  Creators can block fans they can decide not to allow someone to follow them [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1010.38s)]
*  and so really for me it's [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1016.1s)]
*  it's that alignment of incentives and [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1019.34s)]
*  Focusing on what makes a great user experience and a great creator experience is really important to us and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1022.14s)]
*  and does that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1029.14s)]
*  so it seems like you're [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1030.78s)]
*  suggesting that the platform can be a bit of an oasis to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1032.54s)]
*  the experience elsewhere, but it seems like I [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1037.3799999999999s)]
*  Mean, is it even worth thinking about how the internet itself could be more along these lines or like should we at this point? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1042.58s)]
*  And his only fans building its business on the assumption that it will forever be sort of an [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1050.58s)]
*  Offshoot right where you'll do discovery people will go out into the you know [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1057.4199999999998s)]
*  The wastelands and come back with their fan base and that's that or is there [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1061.5s)]
*  Is there a possibility that you that you could see emerging otherwise? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1067.1s)]
*  I'm an optimist. I really would like to think that we can [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1071.9399999999998s)]
*  Build better social media platforms and we can make changes [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1076.54s)]
*  I think some of the structural issues we talked about earlier on do make that hard [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1080.34s)]
*  And there's a lot of lessons that can be learned about retrofitting safety [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1084.14s)]
*  Right, and that's one of the problems right if you build a network in a particular way [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1088.14s)]
*  And then it goes wrong in some of the ways that you've discovered. It's been very hard to think [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1092.14s)]
*  How do I put that genie back in the bottle? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1096.34s)]
*  How do I how do I do it do it in a different way but still be successful and for us because we've been successful [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1097.98s)]
*  While building and while having safety by design and while thinking about and being cognizant about the risks that are prevalent on our platform [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1104.74s)]
*  and controlling for them appropriately [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1112.4599999999998s)]
*  It's different because it's safety by design rather than safety by afterthought. So [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1114.6599999999999s)]
*  But I'm hopeful an afterthought and an effort is still better than nothing [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1120.54s)]
*  And so I'm hopeful that we can get there and I'm hopeful that we will see but more change and a more optimistic future for social [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1124.74s)]
*  media [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1131.58s)]
*  So I [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1133.62s)]
*  write for the journal and I am pretty sure I would be in trouble if I [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1135.1799999999998s)]
*  Didn't ask what happened to the the IPO plans from a few years back, you know, it seemed like [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1140.1s)]
*  Seemed like only fans was I mean had a great cash flow was you know [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1148.18s)]
*  Looking at a SPAC had a you know ability to cash out. I'm sure at a great multiple what the hell happened [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1155.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we were talking about this backstage and we said look what happened to the companies that did SPAC, right? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1163.1399999999999s)]
*  And so that was a bullet. I don't think that was [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1168.9s)]
*  Did the SPACs problem but I think for us, you know, it's not an art [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1173.0600000000002s)]
*  It's on our current plans, right? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1176.94s)]
*  There needs to be a real incentive as to why you want to go public and what that means [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1178.46s)]
*  It also may impact, you know could impact on some of the values that we have [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1184.74s)]
*  We're able to have the values that we have because we're a privately held company. We're able to say that's okay [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1189.18s)]
*  We don't have to chase every single red cent that exists we can make choices that we feel are better for our community [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZAzMDcsTfE&t=1195.1s)]
