# Inspire Brands CEO on Marketing for Chains Like Dunkin' and Sonic | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o)
*  Let's zoom out a bit before we look in a little closer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=0.0s)]
*  You obviously have Dunkin' Donuts, Arby's, all these [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  brands, which give you a pretty good view across the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=6.12s)]
*  country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=8.48s)]
*  But we've heard mixed signals about where consumers are [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=10.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=12.48s)]
*  They have jobs, and they're happy about that, but they're [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=13.64s)]
*  worried about inflation and the prices that they're seeing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=15.76s)]
*  Where do you see it right now, and where do you see it [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=19.56s)]
*  heading this year? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=21.92s)]
*  I think you'll hear the same thing from me that you've [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=23.0s)]
*  heard, is there are a lot of mixed signals out there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I have to say that I'm quite surprised around the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=26.52s)]
*  overall robustness of the consumer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=29.52s)]
*  And I think most CEOs I talk to say the same thing, thought [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=32.48s)]
*  that we might be in a much different position right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=35.12s)]
*  And we do see different patterns depending upon the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=37.76s)]
*  extremities of the consumer, particularly if you get into [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=41.92s)]
*  the lower income. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=44.16s)]
*  And we see, like I said, most everybody in the US. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  And we actually, 30% of our transactions are cash as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  So we actually see, again, the full spectrum. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=51.96s)]
*  And we are seeing different patterns in the below $75,000, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=54.92s)]
*  particularly the below $45,000 in US household incomes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=58.84s)]
*  And you're seeing a lot more going to value. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=64.08s)]
*  So everyday value is certainly getting a lot more pickup. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=68.48s)]
*  We're seeing some trade down within some of our brands to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  actually smaller size combos or less items on the check. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  But we're also seeing different patterns across [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=79.48s)]
*  brands. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  One of our brands, Duncan, is actually seeing a bit of an [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=81.64s)]
*  uptick in that particular customer base, because it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=84.48s)]
*  in the middle of the tier of a lot of its competitive set. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=89.2s)]
*  So I think it's actually getting a little trade too into [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=93.12s)]
*  that brand, where a lot of our other brands are just seeing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=96.12s)]
*  different patterns. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=98.2s)]
*  So it's just all over the place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=98.84s)]
*  And the cash component is an interesting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=100.2s)]
*  look at the country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=103.12s)]
*  Do you see that consumer behave differently than the people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=104.12s)]
*  who pay with credit? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=106.56s)]
*  It's certainly the most sensitive. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  So we actually see everything I just said gets a bit [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=109.56s)]
*  accentuated with that customer as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=111.44s)]
*  Is there a single menu item at one of your brands that is the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=113.44s)]
*  signal that you look for that gives you an idea of people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=117.68s)]
*  are really feeling it, or people are willing to splurge [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  a little bit? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  It's really more the pattern. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=123.68s)]
*  Do we see an extra attach? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=125.0s)]
*  Do they add a slider to it, or are they doing it with a small [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  combo versus a medium combo? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=128.88s)]
*  So it's a little bit of a trading around the menu versus [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=130.4s)]
*  any one menu item. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=132.76000000000002s)]
*  With so many brands that you oversee, how do you make sure [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  the marketing is distinctive? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=139.16s)]
*  Do you communicate, oh, right now we're worried about price [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  sensitivity, let's all advertise accordingly? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  No, we let the brands actually do what's right for those [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  brands. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=149.84s)]
*  And so even though we've created a portfolio through [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=150.28s)]
*  acquisition of this, and we share a lot of services on the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  back end, we've been trying to be very thoughtful around what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=155.84s)]
*  makes the brand distinct in the eyes of the customer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  And that is under the control of the brand president and the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  CMO of that brand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  So what makes a restaurant a restaurant is what food does [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=165.36s)]
*  it serve? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=168.0s)]
*  What's the experience? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=169.0s)]
*  How does it talk about itself? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  So the messaging, the marketing, the pricing, even [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  though we get advice from the shared services, the ultimate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  decisions around where we fit within the price spectrum. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=176.32s)]
*  Is there what promotions are we running as owned by the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=179.56s)]
*  brand? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=182.0s)]
*  So underneath it and then the back end, we're sharing all the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=182.64s)]
*  services that go into delivering those [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=185.16s)]
*  such capabilities. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=187.92s)]
*  But the brand remains distinct. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  And for something like the Super Bowl ad that Duncan [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=191.2s)]
*  Donut did, how involved are you? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=194.28s)]
*  How much is the brand deciding all that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=196.2s)]
*  Do you just give them a budget and they make it work? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=198.44s)]
*  Or can you tell us a little bit about the back story? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=200.84s)]
*  Well, the Super Bowl is kind of a big deal, because you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=203.6s)]
*  spend a lot of money. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=205.92s)]
*  So I get a little bit more involved, not in actually what [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=206.6s)]
*  it was, but the final, like, are we really going to spend [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=209.88s)]
*  that money? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  And so sometimes brought in a little later in the process [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=215.0s)]
*  than might, I don't know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  It's good to know it's not just journalists who play that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=220.84s)]
*  game. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=224.88s)]
*  But I'd like to get involved in the very front end, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=226.4s)]
*  especially when we buy a brand. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=229.88s)]
*  What is going to be the positioning of this brand? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=231.4s)]
*  Are we all aligned around what its target customer base is, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=233.92s)]
*  what its target customer base isn't? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=236.88s)]
*  How are we going to be competitive from a culinary [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  standpoint? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  What are we going to do differently now that it's part [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  of what we inspire versus maybe what it was doing when [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  it was standalone? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=247.48s)]
*  And so it's called the upfront strategy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=248.76s)]
*  And then after that, it's making sure you have the right [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  people that are empowered to make the decisions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=253.56s)]
*  And in that case, I think Duncan Donut's, correct me if [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=256.0s)]
*  I'm wrong, never had had a Super Bowl ad before you bought [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=258.68s)]
*  it? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=261.44s)]
*  No, they had never done a Super Bowl ad. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=262.12s)]
*  And so the last Super Bowl was the first one. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=264.68s)]
*  And Jill Nelson, who's the CMO, she can maybe explain why. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=268.12s)]
*  But that one was a little bit more accidental, I think, is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=273.52s)]
*  that you had been talking to Ben Affleck about a talent [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=276.72s)]
*  arrangement. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=281.04s)]
*  And he had just started an agency with Matt Damon. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=281.6s)]
*  And they wanted to actually play a creative role and worked [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=284.08s)]
*  and came up with this thing that actually worked so well. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=287.12s)]
*  J.Lo showed up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=291.36s)]
*  She wasn't even supposed to be at the restaurant. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=292.16s)]
*  She showed up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=295.44s)]
*  I think you convinced her to go in front of the camera. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=296.48s)]
*  And we looked at that and said, this is really, really [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=300.12s)]
*  special. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  And so maybe there is something. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=304.12s)]
*  This happened to be two weeks, I think, before the Super [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Bowl or something like that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=308.32s)]
*  And so maybe we have something Super Bowl ready, really [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=309.56s)]
*  planned out, by the way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=312.44s)]
*  But it helps that we buy a lot of media across all of our [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=315.2s)]
*  brands, and so we're able to find a really good placement, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=317.6s)]
*  pod 1A, I think, in the Super Bowl. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=319.92s)]
*  And it really meant a lot to the franchisees. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=321.92s)]
*  Because I think a lot of the franchisees thought that when [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=325.8s)]
*  we bought them that we would cut back on all these things. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=329.0s)]
*  We would actually dilute the brand. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=332.72s)]
*  We wouldn't let them spend the resources. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=334.24s)]
*  So this is a little bit of an opposite of that, to be honest. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=336.0s)]
*  And then the second, how involved was your creative [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  teams? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=342.32s)]
*  How much did you just outsource it to the stars? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=342.72s)]
*  OK, Joe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=345.48s)]
*  I'm not going to do your job for you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=346.16s)]
*  It's very opportunistic, is probably the right word, that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=350.68s)]
*  we would have used to describe the entire experience. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=353.56s)]
*  As Paul said, for Duncan joining the portfolio, we [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=357.0s)]
*  were able to learn from all the other brands and kind of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=360.76s)]
*  change our approach in general from all this LTO messaging, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=363.04s)]
*  lots of quick turns to something a little bit more [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=367.88s)]
*  brand-focused that kind of reflected what Paul said [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=369.92s)]
*  around the positioning. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=372.12s)]
*  So it was quick, but impactful. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=373.04s)]
*  That's one of the things I think brands in this space can [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=378.08s)]
*  run into the trap of becoming an LTO machine, just talking [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  about whatever the next limited time offer is without [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  no really thematic, what is it laddering up to? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=385.52s)]
*  Is it actually helping build the brand and build it aware [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=388.0s)]
*  versus the next 1% of sales that you might get? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=391.24s)]
*  And so I think Jill and the team have been great at [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=394.84s)]
*  transitioning from that model to a much more platform-based [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  model. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  We don't have to just talk about them, but how much was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=400.52s)]
*  buying that brand about changing the marketing? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=402.64s)]
*  Did you think there was an opportunity to re-present the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=405.16s)]
*  brand to the country, or was there other aspects of that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  coffee business you liked? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=411.6s)]
*  Well, that morning, that day part is an [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=413.6s)]
*  amazing day part to be in. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=416.44s)]
*  And there are only really three big players in that day [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  part, Duncan being one of them. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's a great day part because it is, one, we have a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=422.72s)]
*  high frequency of customer. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=425.56s)]
*  Generally, in this business, it's not a tremendously high [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=426.8s)]
*  frequency customer, but in the morning day part, it is, which [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  actually lends itself to a strong loyalty program, which [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=433.52s)]
*  lends itself to a lot of information and data that comes [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  off of that as well. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=438.96s)]
*  And we had seen some things that the brand had done and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=440.84s)]
*  not seen the full benefit of. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=444.08s)]
*  They replaced every single piece of coffee equipment in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  every single restaurant, every single espresso equipment in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=448.24s)]
*  every single restaurant right during COVID, right before [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=450.52s)]
*  COVID. So we felt there was an opportunity to really push [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=453.32s)]
*  harder on that side of it as well. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=455.52s)]
*  The one thing we did is actually accelerate the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  redesign of the loyalty program that was, I think, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  holding the brand back a bit. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=462.72s)]
*  And there was all the work being done, but we actually [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=465.76000000000005s)]
*  accelerated the relaunch. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  What did you actually change? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  It was a very, once it was basically you get a certain [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=470.24s)]
*  number of points and you can get a free drink. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=473.68s)]
*  Points, drink, points, drink. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=475.6s)]
*  It was very little utility to it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=476.92s)]
*  And so we turned it into a full points-based model with a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=479.04s)]
*  points fund. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=483.16s)]
*  So that also helps in a franchise environment where if [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  somebody's actually earning points in one restaurant, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  money goes up into the fund. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=489.16s)]
*  And if it's redeemed, it goes back. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  So it actually allows for a lot more flexibility and utility. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=491.56s)]
*  And since we relaunched the program last year, our loyalty [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  dollar sales are up 24% year over year. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=498.56s)]
*  So it just shows that actually that is an important [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=502.84s)]
*  component, particularly in that day part. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=504.68s)]
*  And is that data shining that it's just the core customers [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=506.35999999999996s)]
*  who are coming back more? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=509.0s)]
*  Are you bringing in new people? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  Like what's the other? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=511.2s)]
*  It's a little bit of both. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=512.4s)]
*  So one of the things we did is add a tier. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=513.24s)]
*  So if you go 12 times a month, you get boosted status. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=515.84s)]
*  A little rocket goes off on the app and all that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=521.68s)]
*  But 20% more points for every purchase as long as you're [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=524.12s)]
*  boosted and stay there. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=527.4s)]
*  And you actually see the frequency curve. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=528.5999999999999s)]
*  The moment we launched that, it actually drove [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  frequency above 12 up. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=534.28s)]
*  So that is obviously pulling your [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=536.12s)]
*  frequency customers up. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=537.88s)]
*  We're working on some initiatives in marketing to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=541.16s)]
*  bring more people in the bottle. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=543.4s)]
*  But a lot of it is actually just getting people for more [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  frequency and more upsell. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=546.88s)]
*  It's interesting to hear you talk about this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=548.3599999999999s)]
*  I know you were in the hotel industry before you got into [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=549.88s)]
*  the food business. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=551.84s)]
*  Obviously, the loyalty programs there are well [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=553.72s)]
*  established. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=556.08s)]
*  How much of that did you bring with you? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=557.08s)]
*  Do you see some of the dynamic pricing that hotels and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=561.48s)]
*  airlines have used? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=564.56s)]
*  Is that coming? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=565.6s)]
*  It's gotten a lot of bad press. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=566.48s)]
*  Wendy's and others talk about dynamic pricing their burgers. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=568.6s)]
*  Well, a lot of what we're doing in the hotel industry is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=571.56s)]
*  a model. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=573.28s)]
*  Even in the loyalty program, the fund-based model, I think [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=573.84s)]
*  the first restaurant company to do a fund model like that, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=577.3199999999999s)]
*  where that is the way you do it in the hotel industry. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=580.36s)]
*  It's the only way you can actually have programs that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=582.72s)]
*  can really extend across multiple franchisees and maybe [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=584.8399999999999s)]
*  ultimately multiple brands. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  But even how we're organizing ourselves is a tightly [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=589.36s)]
*  integrated shared services platform, where the brands, as [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=591.6s)]
*  I mentioned before, have the elements that keep them [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  distinct. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=596.52s)]
*  But everything behind the scenes, everything around [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=597.0s)]
*  buying media, everything around customer marketing, all [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  those capabilities are shared under a common platform with [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=602.52s)]
*  common technology. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=605.56s)]
*  On pricing, that's part of this fascinating transition [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=607.52s)]
*  that the restaurant industry is going through, going through [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=611.04s)]
*  being an entirely analog industry. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=613.56s)]
*  If you think about it, the menu prices were static. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=616.8399999999999s)]
*  The relationship you had with a customer started when they [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  walked on your property, and it stopped the moment they [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=621.4799999999999s)]
*  walked off. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=623.4799999999999s)]
*  You had no idea. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=624.2399999999999s)]
*  You couldn't keep talking to them. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=624.92s)]
*  You didn't have a channel to them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=626.16s)]
*  Now it's going to be highly digitized. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=627.76s)]
*  It will be 30% of our sales will be digital sales, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=630.04s)]
*  actually last year. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=633.1199999999999s)]
*  That's up from 15% in 2020, and that's up from single [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=634.36s)]
*  digits even three or four years before that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=637.6s)]
*  Was that the pandemic that made that happen? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  It certainly accelerated the trend. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=642.0s)]
*  And so what that allows you to do is obviously have a more [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=644.72s)]
*  personalized approach, personalized in how you market [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=647.32s)]
*  to them, and personalized even in how you actually put [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=650.6s)]
*  promotions in front of them. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  So meaning that I can decide whether you get a deeper [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=655.0s)]
*  promotion than I do because of what I know about you, so [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=659.0s)]
*  personalized pricing. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=662.32s)]
*  Do you take data you know about me from Dunkin' Donuts [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=663.92s)]
*  to help price my wings? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=667.04s)]
*  We do have visibility across. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=669.52s)]
*  So we have a unified data platform that runs [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=671.64s)]
*  across the brands. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  And so we do have the ability, where possible, to actually [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  de-dupe and come up with an Inspire level record, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=678.36s)]
*  appropriately obviously utilized. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  And then that allows us to have richer information about [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=683.04s)]
*  you as a customer from a first party standpoint. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=685.4799999999999s)]
*  And that also allows, therefore, our ability to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=688.52s)]
*  utilize third party through anonymized data and other [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=690.76s)]
*  sources to actually be even more accurate than it would [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=693.68s)]
*  if we were just looking at one individual brand. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=697.0s)]
*  And do you just segment everybody and then you know, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=699.0799999999999s)]
*  OK, this is the kind of person who might show up at Arby's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=702.8s)]
*  for lunch and you're going to send me a coupon? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  No, it's a little bit more around, does this person [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  respond well to promotions? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=711.7199999999999s)]
*  A very promotionally sensitive person versus a more [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=713.52s)]
*  up-sell sensitive person. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  So it helps actually figure out what kind of offers to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=717.7199999999999s)]
*  target at the individual. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=720.8399999999999s)]
*  It also helps us be better at when we go for look-alikes [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=722.2s)]
*  externally. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  And so the more visibility we have to what people are doing [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=725.36s)]
*  amongst our brands, it actually helps us be even more [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=728.24s)]
*  precise around what we go ask when we go ask for look-alike [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=731.76s)]
*  data. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  And do you think consumers understand it well? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=735.72s)]
*  How do you avoid someone worrying that I'm going to pay [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=738.0s)]
*  more for my coffee? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=740.4000000000001s)]
*  Part of it is you tiptoe into this. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=742.36s)]
*  I think you've got to be smart and not get, by greedy is the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=744.36s)]
*  wrong word, but actually going too far too fast in this. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  So we're dipping our toe in the water. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=750.84s)]
*  Because in hotel, I would imagine there's a lot, are [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=752.32s)]
*  there more or fewer variables than there would be for food? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=754.32s)]
*  On pricing? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  On pricing, yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=758.2800000000001s)]
*  Hotels are different because you have the overarching [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=762.08s)]
*  loyalty program that goes across the hotel chain, which [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=764.32s)]
*  for frequent travelers is a big part of their decision. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=766.84s)]
*  And it causes people to really consolidate their business [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=770.76s)]
*  within the chain and the loyalty program. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=774.32s)]
*  So points is a vehicle for promotion and pricing and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=776.2s)]
*  status, quite honestly, is a vehicle is a great lever. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=779.92s)]
*  So it is harder to use a status experiential benefit in the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=783.12s)]
*  restaurant and in the QSR industry than it is in hotels. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  So that's a big variable difference. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=790.4s)]
*  And then you do have less to play with. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=793.04s)]
*  The margins are less. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=795.7199999999999s)]
*  You're talking about a $3 or $4 coffee, not a $300 or $400 [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=797.4799999999999s)]
*  hotel room. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=800.8s)]
*  And so you have less variables there too. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=801.56s)]
*  So it's a bit more about how do you stay top of mind? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=804.56s)]
*  How do you get smarter around what message you're putting in [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=807.56s)]
*  front of that individual at the right time? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  Not just the message, rather, but the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=813.4s)]
*  timing of that message. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=815.68s)]
*  So it's a lot more, I think, precise because you have fewer [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  levers to play with. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  But it's remarkable how digitized, to use your word, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=821.52s)]
*  the food industry has gotten. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't long ago that you didn't know who was walking in [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  or out of a store, much less what they were buying. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's transformed everything marketing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  That's one thing I get so excited about. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=834.0s)]
*  And one reason we actually created Inspire is because to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=835.12s)]
*  build the right kind of infrastructure and capabilities [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=837.76s)]
*  to be competitive in that world versus the older world, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=839.88s)]
*  which is you do some ads, you put them out on linear TV, and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=843.52s)]
*  you hope that they reach the right person and maybe [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=846.24s)]
*  sometimes find their way in and have a hard save. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=848.36s)]
*  So it's an industry that is incredibly [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=851.36s)]
*  advertising sensitive. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=853.76s)]
*  25% to 30% of our sales we can directly attribute to [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=855.0s)]
*  advertising. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=858.6s)]
*  And it's incredibly responsive. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=860.32s)]
*  We put a product out and an ad out tomorrow, I can tell you, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=861.8s)]
*  the next day, whether it's actually working, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=865.48s)]
*  on how it, in fact, sells. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=867.76s)]
*  But it's moved from that kind of model to a highly digital [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=870.0s)]
*  model. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=873.4s)]
*  So even for us, in 2019, 80% of our marketing spend was on [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=873.88s)]
*  linear TV, 20% digital. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=877.96s)]
*  Last year, it's 2 thirds, 1 third digital linear. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=880.16s)]
*  It really should be further. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=884.36s)]
*  We just have to get franchisees sometimes to come [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=885.4s)]
*  along in the journey with us. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=887.3199999999999s)]
*  And the fact that, again, we're able to utilize channels [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=890.16s)]
*  that you couldn't utilize before. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=892.52s)]
*  You can tell I get excited about it, because it's [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=895.36s)]
*  actually what makes this industry so exciting to be in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=896.92s)]
*  at this moment in time. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=900.28s)]
*  Because particularly in all things, marketing is just a [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=901.12s)]
*  fundamental transformation. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=903.56s)]
*  And are you using the digital to also pick up signals, like [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=904.7199999999999s)]
*  negative sentiment on TikTok or something like that? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  And then people are also vocal about and happy there about [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=910.88s)]
*  pricing, and brands can suffer there. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=914.56s)]
*  So do you look for that? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=917.24s)]
*  Do you have teams that are telling you, oh, man, we're [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=918.48s)]
*  looking for that? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=920.12s)]
*  Where we can, if we know it's happening in real time, or if [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=920.92s)]
*  we can attach it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=923.68s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard to attach it to a specific restaurant. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=925.08s)]
*  But if you can, we have mechanisms of pushing that to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=927.08s)]
*  the teams to try to do something about it quickly and [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=930.24s)]
*  service recovery. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=932.88s)]
*  So we monitor that very, very closely. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=933.64s)]
*  How much is the marketing this year about that? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=936.88s)]
*  I mean, you're in the value segment. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=939.24s)]
*  I've seen your competitors put out ads saying, oh, the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=940.88s)]
*  burger meal's $10.99. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=943.04s)]
*  It's cheaper than McDonald's or whatever. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=944.4s)]
*  Is that the way to get people to try a Roast Beef Sandwich [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=946.8s)]
*  that they've got? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=950.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're seeing a lot more value messaging out there, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=951.16s)]
*  and you will. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=953.36s)]
*  And you're also seeing a lot more discounting, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=954.0s)]
*  direct discounting. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=956.24s)]
*  So you'll hear menu prices have actually gone up [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=957.3199999999999s)]
*  tremendously across the board. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=961.24s)]
*  If you look at the landed price, the landed price post [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=963.68s)]
*  discounting or whatever terms has actually [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=966.48s)]
*  gone up much less. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=968.04s)]
*  And it's because you're seeing a lot more, off of a higher [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=969.84s)]
*  headline price, you're seeing a lot more discounting. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=972.6s)]
*  But you're also seeing more always on as well, two for [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=976.56s)]
*  this, two for that, three for this, in order to stay valued. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  So I think that is going to be the mantra. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=982.88s)]
*  And I think one thing we have to do, if you talk about the [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=987.5999999999999s)]
*  state of the consumer, is stay agile. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=990.68s)]
*  Because I think nobody really quite knows how the rest of [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=992.28s)]
*  this year is going to shape up. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=994.4799999999999s)]
*  We're talking about what we're seeing in customers today. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=997.0s)]
*  Even the Wall Street Journal, you have Jamie Dimon talking [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  about 8% interest rates. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1001.64s)]
*  And as of yesterday, the market's pricing in at 70%, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1003.0s)]
*  80% probability of three rate cuts, 50 basis points in June. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1006.44s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1011.04s)]
*  Then you throw everything out. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1012.32s)]
*  So what we have to do and what we're focused on is being [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1013.12s)]
*  really agile. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1016.52s)]
*  The way Jamie said it is we're trying to set ourselves up to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1017.64s)]
*  be successful as a company at 8% or 2%. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1020.44s)]
*  I think that's kind of the place. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1023.4s)]
*  And the competition then is just people buying groceries [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1024.36s)]
*  and eating at home? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1027.8s)]
*  That's what you have to fight off? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1029.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1030.6s)]
*  The in-home, at-home, in-home, out-of-home is [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1031.96s)]
*  definitely a dynamic. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1034.24s)]
*  And when you see those lines cross, it's one of the things [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1036.28s)]
*  we watch all the time, which is whether price of food [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1038.44s)]
*  inflation at home or out of home. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1041.72s)]
*  And you can see the impact when out of home. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1043.2s)]
*  In fact, that's in-home. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1045.2s)]
*  Grocery prices actually were accelerating much faster than [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1048.4s)]
*  restaurant prices the last few years. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1051.64s)]
*  And so you could see the benefit that those lines have [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1053.72s)]
*  crossed. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's something we need to watch out for. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1058.08s)]
*  We've seen it in our reporting. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1059.52s)]
*  We've heard from people, like the sticker shock, if you [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1060.84s)]
*  want to call it that, that they see when they go to the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1063.1599999999999s)]
*  restaurant is like a visceral. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1064.76s)]
*  People really are anti-motivating, I guess you [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1066.4399999999998s)]
*  could say. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1069.48s)]
*  You haven't seen that in the categories you're in. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1069.9599999999998s)]
*  Again, it depends on the category. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1073.28s)]
*  You see it more in sit-down. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1074.48s)]
*  So we see a bit more of a buffalo wild wings. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1076.52s)]
*  But by the time you get all the way through the tax, the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1078.76s)]
*  tip, and everything, then it can turn into quite a, not us. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1080.76s)]
*  We're not like that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1084.1999999999998s)]
*  But everybody else. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1084.76s)]
*  Every other casual dining restaurant is a problem. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1085.9599999999998s)]
*  I guess, do you want to pick one of the brands that you [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  guys bought? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1093.52s)]
*  Because you've rolled up several. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1094.24s)]
*  And maybe explain, what was it that you saw there? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  What did you change? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1098.36s)]
*  Did you change the menu? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1099.36s)]
*  Did you change the buildings? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1100.4399999999998s)]
*  Was it the marketing? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1102.36s)]
*  I don't know which one you want to pick. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  But it would be interesting to hear your thought process. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1105.48s)]
*  I think Jimmy John's is a good story. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1107.24s)]
*  Jimmy John's is a phenomenal brand, a phenomenal product. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  And the founder did an amazing job of building a really high [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  quality fast captive delivery. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1116.56s)]
*  So about 30% delivery. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1119.8s)]
*  But it was actually slowing down in growth. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1122.8s)]
*  In fact, it was negative company when we bought it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  And what we found is a few things. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1127.44s)]
*  Some of the things that were making it great initially were [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1129.2s)]
*  holding it back. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1132.0s)]
*  It was not doing a lot of things that you do in this [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1133.76s)]
*  industry, which is combos, limited time offers, more [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1136.2s)]
*  product innovation. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1140.36s)]
*  They didn't sell combo meals, right? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1141.44s)]
*  No combo meals, which causes some challenges with pricing, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1142.9199999999998s)]
*  competitiveness, no real innovation in the product. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1147.72s)]
*  And also, we looked at the messaging and how it was [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1151.92s)]
*  actually positioning itself. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1154.4s)]
*  It was positioning itself entirely around speed. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1157.2s)]
*  And then we looked at that. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1161.0s)]
*  You start looking at, well, to a consumer, there can be a [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1162.2s)]
*  trade-off between speed and quality. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  And Jimmy John's is extremely high quality. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1167.5600000000002s)]
*  Everything's made their cut there. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1172.0800000000002s)]
*  So we actually twisted the message around and came up with [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1173.16s)]
*  the new ad campaign, supported by Anomaly, on [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1175.84s)]
*  actually having a counter character that was actually [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1179.36s)]
*  talking about lamenting the quality of it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  And so we were able to bring a quality cue message into the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1186.6799999999998s)]
*  overall messaging that didn't get in the way of the speed. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1190.48s)]
*  And I think that was a little bit of an unlock, too, and a [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1194.84s)]
*  little irreverence that was brought in there every now and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  then, which I think that brand has the right to do. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  So each brand sets its own strategy. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1202.48s)]
*  Do you give them a budget, or how does it work? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1205.24s)]
*  Budgets are relatively fixed, because in a franchise [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1207.88s)]
*  environment, there are generally funds that actually [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1210.64s)]
*  drive the investment. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1212.96s)]
*  And it's a percentage of sales that gets contributed to the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1214.64s)]
*  funds, so that can be a finite thing. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1216.8s)]
*  Now, on the positive news for marketers, it's a budget that [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1219.24s)]
*  generally doesn't get cut as long as the top line's growing. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1223.48s)]
*  The marketing funds are growing, but you have to [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1226.24s)]
*  actually be justified how you spend it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1228.84s)]
*  But that is that. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1231.68s)]
*  We do look at where they're spending the money, how much [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1233.44s)]
*  they're spending on infrastructure versus [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1235.44s)]
*  spending on media. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1236.92s)]
*  And it's one thing we look hard at is really trying to have [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1238.72s)]
*  super hard questions about anything that isn't going into [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1241.44s)]
*  working, because sometimes you'll buy a brand where they've [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1243.8s)]
*  gotten a little bit relaxed around it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1247.72s)]
*  How much do you have the operators of the stores have [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1249.0800000000002s)]
*  input on any of the marketing? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1253.4s)]
*  It depends on the franchise group and the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1255.56s)]
*  franchise relations. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1257.8400000000001s)]
*  And we obviously keep them close, and there's marketing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1259.92s)]
*  committees and all sorts of things. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1262.48s)]
*  A couple of our brands have borderline approval rights on [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1265.04s)]
*  certain things with franchisees. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1268.04s)]
*  Other of our brands don't. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1269.96s)]
*  So we respect that, obviously, with the web. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1271.24s)]
*  And you do operate some of your stores. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1272.96s)]
*  So what do you learn from doing that that you [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1274.68s)]
*  would in otherwise? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1276.68s)]
*  Yeah, so we operate about 2,500 of our stores, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1277.52s)]
*  restaurants, which is different than a lot of others. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1280.84s)]
*  It allows us to align our incentives with our [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1283.84s)]
*  franchisees. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1287.04s)]
*  Because when we're talking to a franchisee about the [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1288.04s)]
*  challenges of commodity inflation or the challenges of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1290.26s)]
*  other inputs, wages and others, we're right there. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1293.74s)]
*  And so we think about the full P&L, not just our cut of the [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1296.42s)]
*  top line, which is one of the challenges sometimes in the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1299.98s)]
*  franchise model is that you can get a little overly [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1303.54s)]
*  enamored, because you do a lot of things to drive the top [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1305.98s)]
*  line that don't necessarily flow through the bottom of [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1307.98s)]
*  the franchisee. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1309.86s)]
*  And so that keeps us a bit honest there. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1310.98s)]
*  It also allows us to try things first. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1312.82s)]
*  So we remodeled 100 Arby's before we asked a franchisee [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1314.98s)]
*  to on our own dime. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1319.3s)]
*  We made lots of changes in that process. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1320.46s)]
*  And it allowed us to move faster once we rolled it out. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1324.86s)]
*  Buffalo Wild Wings Go, which we're opening our 100th [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1327.94s)]
*  standalone Buffalo Wild Wings Go tomorrow in Manhattan, we [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1330.8999999999999s)]
*  built the first 50 ourselves to actually figure out the right [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1334.22s)]
*  real estate strategy to go along with that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1337.22s)]
*  And then once we turned it to franchising, we've sold 600 [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1339.7s)]
*  commitments in 18 months, because they were able to see [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1342.58s)]
*  what we were doing with our company restaurants first. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1345.1s)]
*  And if you have that many franchisees, owners, how do [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1347.02s)]
*  you handle the issues we were just talking about before in [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1350.74s)]
*  terms of corporate purpose and the marketing messages you're [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1353.78s)]
*  willing to take on and the ones you don't? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1356.1399999999999s)]
*  Does that all come through you? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1358.82s)]
*  I think your values and belief systems and alignment around [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1360.1399999999999s)]
*  that are actually more important than a franchise [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1362.7s)]
*  system than I think they are in a normal company, if you [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1364.26s)]
*  will, because that culture, that common belief system, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1368.54s)]
*  that alignment around purpose of the brand is kind of a [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1371.78s)]
*  little bit of the glue that holds the [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1374.82s)]
*  franchise system together. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1375.78s)]
*  And it's something that when you bring in a new brand, when [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1377.82s)]
*  we bring in a new brand, it comes along with that franchise [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1380.86s)]
*  system and that belief system. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1383.26s)]
*  We're really careful not to, we pay very close attention and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1384.1s)]
*  we're very respectful of that. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1388.98s)]
*  And so we've tried to create a culture at the inspire level [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1390.74s)]
*  that is really complementary to the value system and belief [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1393.86s)]
*  system that will come in with the franchise groups. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1397.46s)]
*  Many have been part of those brands for 20, 30, their [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1399.74s)]
*  families may have been part of them for 40 years. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1402.5s)]
*  And that's a big part of their culture. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1405.5400000000002s)]
*  So we have to respect that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1407.5400000000002s)]
*  But ultimately, whether you decide to get behind a social [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1409.5400000000002s)]
*  cause or a political issue that comes to you, or how do [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1412.5400000000002s)]
*  you guys decide this? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1415.14s)]
*  Do you have a committee? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1415.94s)]
*  We really take the stance that we focus on things that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1418.42s)]
*  influence us directly as an organization, influence our [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1422.5800000000002s)]
*  business directly as an organization. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1425.5800000000002s)]
*  And really have to keep in mind that we have 3,300 [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1427.3000000000002s)]
*  individual business owners. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1431.3400000000001s)]
*  We have 650,000 team members. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1432.58s)]
*  We have millions of customers. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1435.3799999999999s)]
*  We serve 300 million customers a year. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1437.22s)]
*  That we're very careful about speaking out for them. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1439.9399999999998s)]
*  And so we really try to be very thoughtful around when [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1444.98s)]
*  we're going to be out there saying something. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1447.22s)]
*  Is it actually something that has a direct impact on our [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1449.82s)]
*  business and our franchisees and our team members? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1453.1s)]
*  So you were sure orange jumpsuits weren't going to [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1455.58s)]
*  offend anybody who could get by with that? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1458.06s)]
*  Well, it doesn't mean we don't get edgy every now and then. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1459.9399999999998s)]
*  And I wouldn't know if orange jumpsuits are edgy. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1462.06s)]
*  But I think part of that, again, goes back to being clear [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1466.74s)]
*  who your customer is. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1468.7s)]
*  Ultimately, we're in the business of serving customers. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1469.78s)]
*  Who they are, what motivates them, what will motivate them [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1472.98s)]
*  to actually hopefully do more business with you. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1475.78s)]
*  Certainly what we get in the way of them doing business [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1477.8999999999999s)]
*  with you is important to understand. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1479.98s)]
*  And then just kind of stay in that lane as much as possible. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1481.34s)]
*  I want to give a chance. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1485.46s)]
*  Yes, questions? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1486.26s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1486.98s)]
*  Hi, Paul. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1493.06s)]
*  This is Carolyn. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1493.5s)]
*  I'm with AppsFlyer. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1494.6599999999999s)]
*  We are a company specialized in measurement to help marketing [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1495.98s)]
*  understand how to drive growth. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1501.02s)]
*  So I want to ask a question, picking into a point you made [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1502.6599999999999s)]
*  earlier, when you acquired these brands, you had mentioned [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1507.02s)]
*  about the brands shared the back end infrastructure. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1510.7s)]
*  So I'm curious. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1515.94s)]
*  Not all the brands were acquired. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1517.82s)]
*  At the same time, what are the components that you have [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1519.6599999999999s)]
*  deliberately integrate so that the inspired brands in general [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1522.3799999999999s)]
*  have a consistent back end infrastructure? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1528.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and we're actually in the middle of the journey. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1532.2199999999998s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1533.9799999999998s)]
*  So obviously from a data platform standpoint, that's [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1535.06s)]
*  one of the first things we do is have a unified data platform [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1538.8999999999999s)]
*  and try where possible to bring all the data in one place. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1541.7399999999998s)]
*  There's a foundational element. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1544.9799999999998s)]
*  Above that, we call it an inspired digital platform, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1547.22s)]
*  which is the web app platform. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1549.78s)]
*  And so extending the experience will continue to look very [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1551.6200000000001s)]
*  different from the customer-consumer, but a [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1554.5800000000002s)]
*  common platform across the brands. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1556.98s)]
*  And we have three brands on that today. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1558.78s)]
*  We have three more brands to put on that, because that [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1560.5800000000002s)]
*  doesn't happen overnight. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1562.94s)]
*  And then the MarTech stack that goes along with that. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1564.98s)]
*  If they're already on a well-established CDP, we [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1569.26s)]
*  actually may think of a way to do that. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1573.54s)]
*  We actually may think about keeping that, but we really [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1576.42s)]
*  try to get that as unified as possible. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1578.86s)]
*  And then anything that hangs off of that, anything that [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1582.3s)]
*  drives from a customer marketing standpoint, loyalty [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1587.02s)]
*  program, not the program itself, but the underlying [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1590.06s)]
*  technology and infrastructure underneath the program, we're [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1594.46s)]
*  also trying to actually align that as well. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1597.42s)]
*  So is the loyalty point program, did that get launched [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1601.42s)]
*  recently? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1605.42s)]
*  For Duncan, the new version of it called Duncan Rewards was [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1606.8200000000002s)]
*  launched in October, November of last year, something? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1609.74s)]
*  2022, gosh. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1613.3400000000001s)]
*  It's already 2024, sorry. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1614.8200000000002s)]
*  2022. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1616.46s)]
*  But that was, again, the different point structure. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1619.1000000000001s)]
*  Buffalo Wild Wings has a loyalty program that came [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1621.78s)]
*  along with the brand. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1624.14s)]
*  And Jimmy John's has a loyalty program that came [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1625.8200000000002s)]
*  along with the brand. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1627.66s)]
*  And they're separate. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  They're not linked. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1630.5s)]
*  We don't have an umbrella across them like you do in [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1631.94s)]
*  the hotel industry. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1634.38s)]
*  Doesn't mean that it couldn't happen at some point in time. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1635.46s)]
*  And we're building things in such a way that if we decided [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1638.38s)]
*  that was the right thing to do, that we could. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1641.0200000000002s)]
*  And so building to that as a potential outcome, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1643.42s)]
*  nothing works now. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1646.2600000000002s)]
*  And then we're in the process of launching a loyalty program [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1648.66s)]
*  for the other two brands that don't have one. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1651.2600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1654.0600000000002s)]
*  Hi, I'm Steven Tristan Young, team of Poshmark. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1656.22s)]
*  So the speaker that we just had earlier talk a lot about [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1658.46s)]
*  cultural hot spot, hot flashes and moments. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1662.18s)]
*  I love to hear your perspective as CEO with a number of brands [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1664.74s)]
*  that cut across so many different dimensions of audiences. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1667.0600000000002s)]
*  What's the guidance that you give to your teams about when [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1670.46s)]
*  to be involved, not to be involved? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1672.7800000000002s)]
*  This tricky watch, because you do have a lot of brands that [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1675.14s)]
*  a lot of people love. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1677.42s)]
*  What's been your stance on that? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1678.46s)]
*  I'd love to hear the CEO perspective. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1679.42s)]
*  Yeah, and the brands are very different. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1680.8600000000001s)]
*  And if you look at demographics of the brands, for instance, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1682.26s)]
*  Buffalo Wild Wings is 60% male. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1684.7s)]
*  Duncan is 60% female. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1687.26s)]
*  And so you get East Coast, West Coast, middle of the country. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1688.74s)]
*  It's about as diverse from a customer, basically, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1691.82s)]
*  as you could possibly get. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1694.1399999999999s)]
*  And so the advice is to be laser focused on who [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1695.8999999999999s)]
*  their customer is. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1699.3s)]
*  And think about the cultural flashpoints, the things that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1701.34s)]
*  actually matter to those guests. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1704.54s)]
*  And do it in a respectful manner. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1707.06s)]
*  So it's always try to push the envelope and be top of mind, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1709.06s)]
*  which is a big game in this industry. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1712.9399999999998s)]
*  You always have to be top of mind. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1714.54s)]
*  Do it in a way that, again, is aligned with what our guests [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1716.8999999999999s)]
*  would expect our brands to do. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1721.02s)]
*  Not something that's out of left field, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1722.94s)]
*  not going into a place that brand [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1724.82s)]
*  doesn't have permission to play. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1726.46s)]
*  And certainly being respectful of not just, again, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1728.7s)]
*  of the customers that are part of it, but also others that [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1732.1399999999999s)]
*  may, again, like I said, don't want [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1734.98s)]
*  to be a reason for people not to come and be [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1737.62s)]
*  part of your brand experience. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1739.58s)]
*  But I do not. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1741.74s)]
*  That is not my job. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1743.06s)]
*  My job as the CEO, I think, is set the culture [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1744.78s)]
*  and set the processes and help build the capabilities [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1747.5s)]
*  of the teams that are making the decision. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1752.14s)]
*  But I think particularly the portfolio of diverse brands [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1753.58s)]
*  like this, and I'm a little bit of an experimental marketer [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1756.6200000000001s)]
*  from the past, but I'm not the person that you want making [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1761.22s)]
*  those decisions. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxnHgHw58o&t=1763.66s)]
