# Williams Racing Team Principal on Building an F1 Champion, Growth in the U.S. and More | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY)
*  You know, this is the fourth time we're here in Miami. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=0.0s)]
*  Now we know we're going to be back here for decades to come. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=2.96s)]
*  What does that say about how influential the U.S. now is in F1 and how far it's come? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=5.84s)]
*  Yeah, it is hugely significant. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what I always compare to is where we were 10 years ago, where F1 wasn't even [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  really known as a sport or a brand properly within the U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=18.56s)]
*  And now we're, I mean, this is the fastest growing market. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=22.16s)]
*  A quarter of all of our partners, sponsors that are with the teams are American, which [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=26.32s)]
*  just gives you an idea of what it is. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  For us, Dalton is based in America. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=31.92s)]
*  We have a U.S. office. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=34.32s)]
*  America is a core part of what we are doing as a sport. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=36.16s)]
*  And as I said, what I'm really proud of is how that's migrated across the next, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  the last 10 years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=42.64s)]
*  And more importantly, probably the direction of travel over the next 10 years as well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=44.08s)]
*  You know, they just all raise their hands. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=48.32s)]
*  There's a lot of drive to survive fans here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=50.32s)]
*  It seems to me that one of the things that's missing is a star American driver. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  You had Logan Sargent for just about a couple of years at Williams. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  How close are we to having that American breakthrough and what will it take? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  There is, I mean, this would probably shock a few people, but I've signed a driver that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=65.44s)]
*  I think has huge potential, but he's 10, 11 now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=70.72s)]
*  And he wins everything that he can win in karting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=77.76s)]
*  But the reason why I bring that up is our academy, pretty much you're looking to sign [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=80.24s)]
*  up the individuals. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=84.32s)]
*  They start a professional career from age eight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=85.36s)]
*  And there's definitely, there's two names that I can think of. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=88.0s)]
*  One that we've got, one that's signed by a different team that have huge potential. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=90.72s)]
*  But what we've really got to do is structure the right pathway for them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  And that means that a lot of them are living in Europe. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=98.32s)]
*  The whole family decants to Europe. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=100.96s)]
*  That's the case for our young driver, Lucas Palacio. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  He will have a fantastic career, but he's seven years away from getting into the sport. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=106.24s)]
*  What I can really reassure you on is the fact that we're investing in American talent at [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=110.55999999999999s)]
*  that age and properly investing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=116.16s)]
*  It's real investment that we'll be doing for the next seven years through his career. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=117.36s)]
*  And we're looking for more. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  That's the right way to bring star talent through into the sport. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Logan was, as you saw, he was able at times to be competitive, but on the most part wasn't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=125.28s)]
*  really working on the world stage to the level we need him to be. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=130.56s)]
*  What you need is, to your point, not just the passport, but you need to be an absolute [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=133.68s)]
*  star talent, able to win, that goes with it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=138.24s)]
*  So you're saying I should have taken go-karts a lot more seriously when I was younger? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=144.56s)]
*  It is shocking, isn't it, when you realize just how young they start, but that's it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=146.08s)]
*  Age six, they're basically, as far as I go, completing in their professional career. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=149.44s)]
*  And next season brings some of the most sweeping regulation changes we're seeing in the sport for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=154.8s)]
*  a long time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=160.24s)]
*  It affects everything from the chassis to the tire to the engines. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=160.8s)]
*  How do you balance trying to be as competitive as possible this season with trying to be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=164.72s)]
*  the best possible car for next year? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=170.16s)]
*  I think in many regards we have one of the best businesses in the world, and I'll explain [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=174.56s)]
*  what I mean by that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=179.28s)]
*  Traditional companies, you'll have a profit-loss sheet that appears once a year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=180.64s)]
*  And even then, do you really know if you're doing better or worse than your competitors? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=184.56s)]
*  How do you motivate an organization based on an income or a profit? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=187.44s)]
*  Every two weeks in a world stage, we are against nine other teams that want to absolutely [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  out-develop you in the course of the season. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=196.96s)]
*  These cars are prototypes, so we're bringing new parts pretty much every race in order [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=198.4s)]
*  to stay ahead of our competitors. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=202.0s)]
*  And across the season, it wouldn't be unusual to bring a second and a half of performance. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=203.68s)]
*  Now, that long-winded back end to it is simply saying, what happens is if you're in the now, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=207.44s)]
*  you can be really drawn into the now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=212.8s)]
*  And yet, that's not what we're doing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=215.12s)]
*  Everything we are doing, everything I've agreed with our board, everything I've agreed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=216.72s)]
*  with our investment, is that we're here to be successful in multiple years to come. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  And to do that, you have to just leave the now as it is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=224.88s)]
*  You can pick up some low-hanging fruit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=227.52s)]
*  That's what we've done. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=228.8s)]
*  The 25 car is really the effect of bringing in some star engineering talent from across the grid, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=229.36s)]
*  building the team, or fixing some pretty broken assets, trying to put some infrastructure in place, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=235.12s)]
*  changing a little bit of culture, people, technologies. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  But the real game of that is, to your point, in 2026, when we have a clean sheet of paper, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  we can get rid of everything else, tear it all up. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=248.72s)]
*  There's not a single carryover component, not even a bolt will carry over. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=250.96s)]
*  Everything is designed from scratch again. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  And it gives us an opportunity. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=256.8s)]
*  So here's how I balance it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=258.64s)]
*  I joined Williams to win world championships and multiple world championships. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=260.48s)]
*  Simple as that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=265.44s)]
*  And the agreement I have with the board is that's why I'm here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=266.08s)]
*  And what it means is we can't be drawn into the short term. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=269.92s)]
*  And so we have various adages that I've put in place across the organization. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=272.64s)]
*  One is, don't add a tenth today if you can add a tenth tomorrow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=276.64s)]
*  A second is that break everything, really break everything. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  And that breaking of everything will hurt us short term, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=283.6s)]
*  but will give us some massive gains long term. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=286.08s)]
*  And it's really institutionalizing the organization to be culturally different [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=288.64s)]
*  to how we've been thinking before. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=292.4s)]
*  This isn't survival. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  This isn't about next week. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  This is about there will be some problems. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=296.08s)]
*  But what can you bring in one year? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=298.88s)]
*  And I'll give you one year where I'll protect you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=300.56s)]
*  But what can you bring in a year? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=302.96s)]
*  So that's how I balance it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=304.96s)]
*  That said, when the lights go out, I get as wanting as anyone else to score points. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=306.08s)]
*  It's not that I miss the desire to do so on a weekend, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=312.08s)]
*  but it's a focus on the long term. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=314.88s)]
*  As you said, you're starting from scratch, not a bolt. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=316.8s)]
*  When you're leading an engineering team, where do you even start that process of, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=319.68s)]
*  is it just a whiteboard? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Is it a bunch of guys around a conference table? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=325.36s)]
*  What does it look like of just really starting from zero again? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=327.12s)]
*  You're not far off. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=330.08s)]
*  So we've structured a concept group which is formed of some real individuals, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=331.36s)]
*  some from Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes, Alpine, myself, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=336.4s)]
*  where you actually just go through. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=340.08s)]
*  In this particular case, we had over 20 different concepts for next year's car, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=342.88s)]
*  all lined up and ready so that when we weren't allowed to test the 26 car that went on until [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=346.96s)]
*  January the 2nd, on January the 2nd, we started going through every single concept one by one. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=351.12s)]
*  So effectively, the model had everything lined up, hit this very hard so that we can narrow [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=356.0s)]
*  down from 20 concepts down into three fundamentally. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=360.24s)]
*  And so the initial how that all came around is, yes, it's discussion, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=364.48s)]
*  but actually you're simulation led. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=369.04s)]
*  Because simulation will pretty much give you the right boundaries of where to operate in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=370.72s)]
*  And that allows you to direct it a little bit more. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  The old way of doing Formula One was probably more one or two key people going, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=377.12s)]
*  I think the car should look like this, and this is what we'll do. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  But that doesn't work anymore when you're at such a high level of competition. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=383.12s)]
*  As you said, it's not one or two people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure you would have loved to have gone out and hired a dozen, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  maybe three dozen engineers just to help you on this project. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=392.72s)]
*  But given the cost caps, you're not allowed to just hire and do whatever you want. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  Does this type of sweeping change require you to reorganize operations in anticipation of next [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=401.2s)]
*  season and operate in a different way than you had been? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, entirely. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=411.2s)]
*  And yes, is the answer to it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=412.24s)]
*  So probably the best way of explaining it is that a chassis, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  the chassis is basically that holds the engine, it's the hinge that holds it all together. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  If I call it a hinge in the factory, they get very annoyed, but it really is just a hinge. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=422.32s)]
*  And fundamentally, a chassis in Williams two, three years ago was probably made up of 200 [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=427.36s)]
*  components. A chassis that we designed and built together in 24 was 1,900 components. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  A chassis next year is going to be probably into the 5,000 to 7,000 components. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=439.12s)]
*  And the reason why I bring that up is that level of complexity, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=444.64s)]
*  you have to bring people on the journey. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=447.04s)]
*  So if you think about 200 components, you can almost, with a structure of 20 individuals [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=449.04s)]
*  talking together, deal with that. You can't when it's into the thousands or tenth of thousands [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=453.36s)]
*  anymore. So you need process structure, systems around everything. And that's really been the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=458.32s)]
*  big change across the last three years, which is let's have enough structure and process that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=463.12s)]
*  we're not handcuffing people, but that we can deal with an ever more complex situation in front of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=466.88s)]
*  us. You had mentioned 20 some odd designs. How many are you building on a computer and simulating, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=472.16s)]
*  how many do you actually build and actually test in real life? And even for the ones that you test, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=480.24s)]
*  I imagine it's not even a finished product when you test it. Each [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=487.92s)]
*  version I imagine is iterated countless times. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=491.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. So I'd probably say in a simulation land, you're into hundreds of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=494.32s)]
*  millions, certainly tens of millions of different iterations of it, because that's where you need [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=499.28s)]
*  to be. But the beauty of simulation land is you can do that. When you're actually in a wind tunnel, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=503.44s)]
*  you're probably trying to get through something akin to 10,000 to 20,000 basically components. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=508.16s)]
*  So a component can be formed in a design, you maybe have 150, 200 in one particular design, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=514.32s)]
*  but you're trying to get through that in a month. So then you iterate through that. And the real [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=518.64s)]
*  bits that we produce, you produce the final design and you produce about three or four of. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=523.2s)]
*  And that's again what makes our business a little bit odd, but I love about it. We'll come up with [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=528.0s)]
*  a design, we'll only produce three of those, three bits of bodywork, three front wings, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=532.24s)]
*  three rear wings, because you want to iterate so quickly that you're producing the next three of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=535.6s)]
*  a completely different design. If you over-spec and over-build of one particular type, you've [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  wasted money. And we all know that these regulation changes have a habit of reshuffling the pack when [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=544.0s)]
*  they have it. How different do you think the standings might look next year given that you're [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=552.72s)]
*  in this arms race to figure this out, so are all of your competitors? How different will [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=559.44s)]
*  fans when they look at the table next year see it? Well, I'm counting it being different. That's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=565.0400000000001s)]
*  why we're investing in advance. So in some ways I'll be saddened because actually what I like about [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=569.6s)]
*  the grid this year particularly is I've been working in the sport 25 years. This is the closest [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  we've been by a long way. It's a second separating your 20th car down to your first car. And if you [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=581.7600000000001s)]
*  get it just slightly wrong, you can be in our case sixth or 15th, and that's separated by a tenth. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=587.44s)]
*  And I quite like that. It really keeps you on your toes. And I think realistically next year [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=593.68s)]
*  the grid will expand. And it will expand for good reason. There's at the moment probably three or [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  four teams at the front of the grid, one of which may have been in the room beforehand. They're [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=602.2399999999999s)]
*  fighting for a championship. I'm not. I'm okay if we finish fifth, sixth, seventh. I'm okay with that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=606.16s)]
*  as long as we are hitting our KPIs on next year's car. And so that challenge is different up and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=611.12s)]
*  down the grid. My resource bucket is going into next year. Many people will go into trying to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=616.56s)]
*  split between the two. Many people will go into I want to focus on this year because I've got too [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=620.72s)]
*  many problems and I've got to understand them before I can develop next year's car. So that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=624.72s)]
*  would create a natural shift and expansion in the grid. And to your point, this is probably the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=629.44s)]
*  biggest regulation change we've ever had. We haven't changed the power unit to the extent we [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=634.64s)]
*  have and the chassis to the extent we have ever before. And that will throw some spanners in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  works. People will get it right and people will get it wrong. And so the grid will expand out as [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  a result of that. And I won't ask you to predict them, but inside, do you have an internal sense [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=646.72s)]
*  of how it might change based on how you see both yourself and competitors allocating resources of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  this year versus next year? Even that doesn't really tell you the case because every week you're [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=659.52s)]
*  trying to do a thousand decisions to lead you in the right direction. You're trying to outdo your [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=664.96s)]
*  rivals in terms of development slope. But just because you start earlier, maybe your slope, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=668.4s)]
*  for infrastructure reasons, wind tunnel reasons, maybe you've taken the wrong turn, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=674.32s)]
*  is 20, 30% lower than someone else's. So it's still a race, an arms race to catch up. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=678.0s)]
*  I'm just loading the probabilities in our favor by giving ourselves the maximum amount of time, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=682.96s)]
*  the maximum time investment. And I imagine you've had a lot of cups of coffee, maybe some sleepless [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  nights dealing with this over the last year or so. But does the engineering nerd in you at your core [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  get kind of pumped when you have to go back and start at zero and build something brand new? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=702.8s)]
*  A hundred percent. Yeah, I love that our sport is the last few milliseconds worth of development. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  But what I really enjoy is this. It's watching, in this case, probably within our design team, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=716.64s)]
*  200 people working together on how we can do things completely different. So you're not [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=722.4s)]
*  contained in the same box anymore. Completely think different, think in an almost illogical way, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=726.8s)]
*  bring some silly ideas to the table. But that, in my experience, is far more rewarding and enjoyable [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=731.68s)]
*  as an end solution because you're not constraining yourself anymore. And that, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=738.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it keeps me awake. The things that keep me awake are, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=742.2399999999999s)]
*  what more can we do? What haven't we thought about? Where are we going in this? Which can happen [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=746.64s)]
*  whether you're in a current year or into a future year. And I'm not saying this is a strength of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=749.76s)]
*  mine. I think it's a weakness, but I'll wake up at 3 a.m. and have a thought. And that thought can be [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=755.76s)]
*  really bad or fairly good. But that's just how my body reacts. And that definitely happens more [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=759.44s)]
*  in a cycle when we're going to a new regulation set. I can tell you when I'm up at 3 a.m., [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=765.2s)]
*  it's definitely only bad thoughts. And you mentioned these milliseconds making such an [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=769.2s)]
*  enormous difference. You've managed to break into the top half of the standings this season. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=779.12s)]
*  And how brutal is it when things are that scrunched? And [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=784.48s)]
*  in terms of that, what does it take to stay there when things are that tight? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=792.72s)]
*  I relish it and I enjoy it. I like the challenge that comes with it. So I'm a firm believer that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  all of us fail every day. I fail every day. But when you fail, yeah, it's painful. When you fail [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=807.84s)]
*  and learn something and then teach others from that failing, I've become the strongest I ever [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=813.76s)]
*  have before. So when it's this tight, you're going to fail more rapidly. Absolutely. We scored points [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=817.6s)]
*  in four out of five races. I can guarantee you we should have scored in five out of five. I also [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=822.72s)]
*  think we've dropped probably about six or seven points in the races that we did score well in. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=826.8s)]
*  Those are failings. And if you treat it as a negative, you're not really going to have a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=831.92s)]
*  positive reinforcement from it. But actually, if you go to each one, which is what we have as a [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=836.08s)]
*  culture within the team of what can we learn from this and what would we have done differently in [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=839.52s)]
*  the future, which will impact on our future scale, that helps you become a much stronger entity. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=843.52s)]
*  And the closer it is as a grid, the more you can learn from that, the more it will happen as a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=848.48s)]
*  result of it. So I enjoy that. I'm weird that way. I just enjoy the punishment that you get from it [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=852.48s)]
*  because it stays with me. Whereas if you're successful and you only treat it as success and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=858.72s)]
*  you don't look backwards on it, you kind of take it for granted and you don't push yourself further [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=862.48s)]
*  than you ever have before. So I like it's close. I like that we fought our way up into that top [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=867.44s)]
*  half of the grid. I like the fact that there's a chasing pack behind that's awfully close [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  because that pressure forces you to be better. And one of the things I absolutely love about F1 is [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  that it's one of the few truly global sports. I mean, you can go from having a race in Miami [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  to the Middle East to Las Vegas. And at the same time, these are uncertain times, to say the least. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=889.84s)]
*  There are trade disruptions, tariffs, or maybe no tariffs the next day. It seems to change a fair [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=897.04s)]
*  bit. But running a global business that has to deal with payrolls, suppliers, everything in between, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=901.92s)]
*  does that present challenges? Is that something you guys have to navigate? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=910.16s)]
*  It's a short answer, yes. But I think we're actually, as at Lassie and Williams, in a [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=914.16s)]
*  privileged position. And what I mean by that is that we're not reliant on selling fizzy drinks [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  or on selling cars around the world. We are our own independent entity, which at times could be [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=925.36s)]
*  treated as a weakness. It's not at the moment. We have business all over the world fundamentally, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=930.48s)]
*  so not globally impacted. The company, as I said, based in America, but not globally impacted by [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=935.12s)]
*  what's happening there. And it's at its root cause a finance business, which is also in a very [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=939.2s)]
*  different way, can actually benefit in this climate, not be hurt in this climate. We also [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=943.2s)]
*  cover ourselves fairly sensibly. If you look at where we are, who our partners are, they're from [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=948.96s)]
*  all over the world. What currencies we use are spread out as well to try and minimize this risk. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=954.96s)]
*  So just because it's problems, I'm not going to call them problems, difficulties at the moment [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=959.0400000000001s)]
*  within the current climate in America, doesn't mean that that won't shift to the UK next week [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=964.4000000000001s)]
*  or to Europe the week afterwards. So you need to make sure that you're covered against any uncertainty [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=968.4000000000001s)]
*  all over the world. What I can say at the moment is that independence has served us very well. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=972.88s)]
*  We're in a good position. We haven't really had any negative impact as a result of what's happening, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=976.72s)]
*  or we have contingencies that are working around it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=981.36s)]
*  One of those parts just completely fascinates me. You're talking about paying people in different [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=984.32s)]
*  currencies. Are those moments of economic uncertainty the types of things that, as a racing [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=988.4s)]
*  team, you are planning for so that they don't provide to use a bad car metaphor speed bump? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=996.32s)]
*  You do it, I don't know about other businesses, but you're trying to do it fairly organically. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  For example, one of our main income streams will be in dollars, but one of our main outputs [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1008.56s)]
*  will be in either pound or euros. Other income streams will be in euros and pounds as well at [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1012.0s)]
*  the same time. So you're naturally covered by the diversification of your partners and your [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1016.2399999999999s)]
*  different income streams, which helps you in that regard. Different drivers have a preference over [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1021.28s)]
*  what salary they want to earn as well. So there's ways of covering off that way. But I think [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1024.8s)]
*  globally, the large businesses that I've had the pleasure of being involved with kind of work in [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1031.52s)]
*  the same way. You cover yourselves off because no one knows what the uncertainty will be from [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1036.0s)]
*  one week to the next. This one's a little bit more on our face than perhaps others have been, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1039.76s)]
*  but no one really truly knows. So make sure you have coverage in that regard. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1043.76s)]
*  It's just fascinating to think about because I sometimes think we don't think about how these [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1048.24s)]
*  things might touch sports, but everything from workers to everything, it touches it in a [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1051.92s)]
*  remarkable way. And F1 has such a different footprint than say so many of the sports we're [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1059.84s)]
*  used to here where the NFL might go play a game or two overseas or so on and so forth, or have [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1066.48s)]
*  a few handful of players overseas, but F1 is truly across continents. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1072.56s)]
*  I think that's the point you've hit the nail on the head there. We race in 24 different races, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1078.32s)]
*  but I think I haven't got the exact number on my head, 21 different countries. So the result of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1083.1999999999998s)]
*  that is probably a little bit less than actually three in the U.S., probably in 18, 19 different [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1087.04s)]
*  countries. So we're covered, admittedly a lot of those in Europe as well, seven or eight in Europe, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1090.48s)]
*  but the point behind that is it is truly global. There is no one center that you can base yourself [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1095.12s)]
*  in. To that point, you could live in a number of countries and still not be infected because it's [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1099.84s)]
*  still the same distance to travel between all of those. And proof of that is drivers live all over [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1103.92s)]
*  the place fundamentally. Our base in the UK is a bit of a weird one. It's just there's a center of [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1108.56s)]
*  excellence around, I don't know why English people like racing cars. There's a lot of central [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1112.96s)]
*  excellence there, but ultimately it doesn't need to be. And that's what you can see new entrants [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1116.8s)]
*  are going to be based a little bit more all over the place are proving as the result of it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1122.0s)]
*  But you're spot on. We are truly global in every sense of the word. We are 70 million viewers. And [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1126.48s)]
*  when you look at the viewer base, it is literally spread across the world. And that's what I enjoy [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  about our sport. It is no one particular base or structure that allows you to be focused on one [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1137.28s)]
*  place. It's true we have three races in America for good reason. And they're crown jewels. Miami [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1144.72s)]
*  is, I think in the time of the sport, this will be the busiest race we have ever done full stop. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1149.2s)]
*  And for good reason. It's incredible here. It's got the cultural, the business now, and it's got [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1154.72s)]
*  the spectacle with it. That's why it's a crown jewel of what we're doing. But there are other [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1160.8s)]
*  events all over the place that bring their own accolade to it. And that's why I really enjoy [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1165.2s)]
*  about our sport. Silverstone is the crowd. You can hear the crowd as you're driving in in the [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1168.8s)]
*  morning. It's about nine in the morning. You can hear them just roaring away in the background. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1172.88s)]
*  Monza is very similar. It's about passion encased inside that country, in that world. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1176.64s)]
*  Abu Dhabi and the other Middle Eastern countries, they're about the spectacle that happens at the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1181.5200000000002s)]
*  end of the race. The fireworks go on for about 20 minutes. You don't want them to go on for 20 [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1185.44s)]
*  minutes. You can't hear yourself. But the point I'm trying to make behind it, everyone's making it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1188.96s)]
*  their own. And it is truly global. And it is fantastic. I'm sure it's like picking your [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1193.44s)]
*  favorite child. But do you have a favorite race weekend in terms of all these destinations? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1199.6s)]
*  The good news is I only have one child at the moment, so I can pick one. But it really depends [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1205.12s)]
*  what you're looking for. So for example, you're going to say I'm biased because we're based in [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1210.8799999999999s)]
*  the UK. But Silverstone, when you take your headphones off on the pit wall, I can tell you [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1215.9199999999998s)]
*  if there's been a crash or an overtake two and a half kilometers away on the circuit, because people [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1220.24s)]
*  are screaming at the top of their lungs. There is just this deep passion buried in England, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1224.64s)]
*  perhaps again from the fact it's been there for a long, long time. That's what makes Silverstone [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1230.88s)]
*  different. But if you want to go for where there is culture of celebrities, business houses, as I [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1235.2800000000002s)]
*  said, that's Miami now. No doubt about it. There's nothing that rivals Miami. And it's grown every [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1240.3200000000002s)]
*  single year. And it will keep growing every single year in that particular regard. If you want to go [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1246.0s)]
*  to where probably the best track is, that doesn't mean the best racing. But if you ask the drivers [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1250.48s)]
*  who the best track is, that's Japan. They love it. They love it because when you make a mistake, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1256.32s)]
*  it's grass and you crash in a big way. But they're gladiators, and that's why they go out and do what [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1261.2s)]
*  they do. And they enjoy that aspect of it. So it depends on what you're looking for. Singapore, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1266.08s)]
*  it's a night race that the sound resonates off the buildings at night. That doesn't mean there's a [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1271.52s)]
*  lot of overtaking. But wow, it's a spectacle. So it depends what you're looking for. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1275.6s)]
*  You know, every Grand Prix weekend sort of feels almost to me like a mini Super Bowl in terms of, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1281.44s)]
*  it's this sort of days long build up. Everyone's in town. It is a city gets taken over. If you could [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1287.2s)]
*  change one thing about one of these weekends in terms of whether it's the logistics, the structure, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1295.04s)]
*  if it's that you didn't want to have to talk to people like me, what would you change about one [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1301.28s)]
*  of these weeks? The last one for sure. No, it's... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1306.8s)]
*  The biggest thing for me is... So I'll tell you the things that I want to keep. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1315.28s)]
*  For those that are privileged enough to stand on the grid here in Miami, and very specifically here [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1325.28s)]
*  in Miami or a few of the other races around the world, and just look up at the crowd that completely [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1330.08s)]
*  surrounds you before the race starts, I pinch myself because it's an experience in a lifetime. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1334.64s)]
*  So I'd never want to get rid of that. But I'd almost want all of you to be able to experience [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  just a little bit of it. Bottle up that emotion and give it to everyone. And we can't. It's really [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1343.0400000000002s)]
*  quite exclusive in terms of what goes there. But it's providing just a little bit of emotion to the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1347.76s)]
*  rest of the world would be what I would try and change. Now it's hard to do because you want that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1352.64s)]
*  exclusivity element. But the reason why I bring that up is it's something that is so incredible [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1356.48s)]
*  to feel when you're there and so hard to describe when you're not, that I want that to be more shared [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1362.0s)]
*  around. You'd mentioned the sound reverberating off the buildings. How much is that sound when [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1366.64s)]
*  you're down there? Just the feeling it shaking in your bones. How much of that is part of that [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1371.84s)]
*  experience? But it literally is that. Because it's being driven by so many different things. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1377.12s)]
*  You have 20 cars firing up at different times. We fire the car up to effectively bring the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1382.32s)]
*  temperatures down on it. You've got the crowd roaring away. You've normally got a DJ or someone [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1386.48s)]
*  it's not necessarily my style of music, but it doesn't matter. It's in the background. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1392.16s)]
*  Whilst basically a celebrity contained with normally a little surrounding security is moving [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1396.48s)]
*  through the crowd with an air show going overhead. It's just you don't know where to look or where to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1402.48s)]
*  do. And the sound is a large part of it. And yeah, the cars are quieter today. But actually [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1407.28s)]
*  the entertainment isn't. And that's what I enjoy with it. I'd love to open it up in case anyone here [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1414.16s)]
*  has any questions. I know there's some mics floating around. Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1420.56s)]
*  I'd like to ask you a question about talent management. It's a topic that a lot of folks [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1426.8s)]
*  in this room think about. And for you it must show up in an interesting way because you have these [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1430.32s)]
*  extremely high profile kind of global superstar races who sometimes in the heat of the moment [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1434.8s)]
*  after an event can be quite outspoken about the performance of the car or whatever else. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1440.72s)]
*  You then have to turn around to your team of engineers who clearly are very passionate about [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1446.24s)]
*  success and are clearly making data driven decisions and have to make sure that isn't [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1451.76s)]
*  a hit to morale. I'm just really curious how that kind of works when you have folks who can be, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1456.4s)]
*  as I say, quite outspoken. So I think the first thing I'd say is there's a reason why I have [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1461.76s)]
*  Carlos and Alex and the team because their culture, their background, their spirit is actually very [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1467.44s)]
*  akin to mine which is it's not about me, it's not about Carlos and it's not about Alex. Everything [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1474.16s)]
*  we are doing here is about Williams, simple as that, and we want Williams to be successful. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1479.6000000000001s)]
*  And the net result of that is the only way it's successful is we're about a thousand one hundred [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  people now. All thousand one hundred people need to put the drivers on their shoulders and lift [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1487.92s)]
*  them and carry them with them at the same time. So if you fight them you're simply going to walk [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  backwards not forwards as a result of it. The second is these drivers want to be known as the best [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1495.8400000000001s)]
*  sportsmen that have existed and sportsmen are ones that are able to pull basically as leaders [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1502.08s)]
*  teams around them and drive that forward, not ones that push the team away. And there's a real big [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1508.32s)]
*  difference between the two. Even on the grid today there are drivers that are good at doing it and [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1513.6799999999998s)]
*  drivers that are really poor at doing it. So putting that into more business sense, once you [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1517.28s)]
*  have a long-term vision and a goal that we're all aligned towards, everything that is short-termest [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1524.56s)]
*  or what is happening this weekend can almost fall into insignificance. So all the feedback [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1528.48s)]
*  you provide needs to be about how this becomes better in the long term and that might be fixing [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1532.56s)]
*  things now that have a long-term impact but that allows people to drive forward. Talent management [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1536.08s)]
*  within the team itself is this. I strongly believe that the right model is to bring in the very best [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1541.3600000000001s)]
*  graduates that you could ever believe and dream of and create a structure where you fast track the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1548.88s)]
*  really good ones through, that you give them every opportunity through and then some real a sprinkling [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  excellence on top that understand what great looks like, not good but great looks like. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1558.4s)]
*  Because I'm a firm believer that if you sprinkle on the top what I call A-leaders effectively, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1563.28s)]
*  this is not particularly my model but it's a good model, they will then employ A-leaders. They'll [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1567.8400000000001s)]
*  bring up the graduates to be A-leaders. If you put B it will normally go C or D because they're [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1571.8400000000001s)]
*  fearful of being challenged. This shirt is something I'm wearing today but it's my responsibility to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1576.24s)]
*  bring Williams into a better place and then hand this shirt on to someone else in the future. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1581.68s)]
*  If all your leaders adapt and believe in that as well at the same time, you will push through the [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1585.92s)]
*  very best and brightest that will go through your organization. You'll leave it in a better state. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1590.24s)]
*  There's always a role for you. You don't mind being challenged. In fact, your best leaders are [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1594.24s)]
*  the ones that are challenged daily that have people far more intelligent below them. You'll [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1598.0s)]
*  always hear me publicly say this, I'm not the most intelligent person in Williams. There are far better [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1601.92s)]
*  people than I am. I'm good at pointing us roughly the right way and structuring us but it's the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1606.16s)]
*  intelligence of others that will drive us forward. That ethos works with our drivers at the same time. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1611.2s)]
*  Our talent management recognize that. We invest in them, we invest in their future. They invest [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1616.32s)]
*  in future generations in the same token behind that. They're not fearful of being challenged [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1620.64s)]
*  by that and that creates this growth we're looking for. Hopefully that helps a bit. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1625.2s)]
*  Hello, how are you? Hi, I'm very good, thank you. I'm a brand marketer and I'm interested to [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1631.8400000000001s)]
*  understand your perspective on Williams is a brand in and of itself but also your drivers [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1636.08s)]
*  are their own individual brands. How do you ensure consistency while also ensuring individuality? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1641.1999999999998s)]
*  They're good questions. So the brand of Williams is what attracted me towards it because there are [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  very few teams on the grid that I think are synonymous with Formula One and I think Williams [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1653.12s)]
*  is one of those. We still to the day have third most championships in the sport. Yes, we haven't [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1658.96s)]
*  been successful for the last 15-20 years but we're on the pathway back up again and you can't [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1665.2s)]
*  build that up. I was privileged enough to be a part of Mercedes which was for a period of time [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1671.3600000000001s)]
*  the most successful team by a long way but for me it still didn't have the brand attachment that I [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1675.3600000000001s)]
*  have within Williams because it's been there for near 50 years. We'll celebrate that in a few years [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1680.0800000000002s)]
*  time and it's just got some of the best memories I have of the sport still attached to it. So that's [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  Williams as a brand. My job now is to to a certain extent reinvent that. I don't want to just pull on [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1691.84s)]
*  the strings of our heritage because that's not us today. We have to accept and acknowledge that that [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1698.16s)]
*  was our past but I want to do proud to what Sir Frank Williams put in place and move it on from [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1704.32s)]
*  where it has been over the last few years. So it's about using the brand and building on the brand [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1710.24s)]
*  in that regard and the drivers that we have at the moment apart from the fact that I pay their salary [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1716.0s)]
*  but the drivers we have at the moment in the case of Alex and Carlos. Carlos had the choice [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1720.24s)]
*  of going to five teams on the grid but actually what really attracted him is a what we're doing, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1726.48s)]
*  the investment we're doing, the direction we're taking but he wants his name as I do as well to [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1730.56s)]
*  leave his fingerprint on the sport. That's why I'm in Williams. I want to leave it in a better place. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1735.52s)]
*  I'm going to leave my my fingerprint effectively in this team. Carlos wants the same. He did that [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1740.08s)]
*  really well with a number of other teams in the grid. They all became more successful. They left [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1745.44s)]
*  to the point where the success took over and he could have won. This is where he wants to leave [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1750.32s)]
*  that and it's the same with Alex. He's done the hard work. The hard work was three years ago. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1754.4s)]
*  Now it's time to build this organization to something where we can win championships together [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1758.4s)]
*  and they can be known as the key assets while they've done that. So their brand suddenly becomes [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1763.12s)]
*  from this mercenary I need to beat everyone in order to have a job to this is as big as me and [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1767.92s)]
*  I will give them a job for many years to come as long as you help me build this up into a team [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1773.6s)]
*  that's successful. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNsMyjDOYY&t=1777.52s)]
