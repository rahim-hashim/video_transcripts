# Kevin Durant on the Intersection of Sports and Entertainment | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o)
*  So I was going to start by talking to you, Kevin, about the boardroom, which is the business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=0.0s)]
*  venture that the two of you co-founded. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=6.44s)]
*  You'll be happy to hear that I spent quite a lot of time looking at the website. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=9.26s)]
*  I can safely say I'm not the target demographic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=12.84s)]
*  However, well, you can elaborate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=15.6s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, but I can sort of see what you're doing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  What I want to know is when you set it up, Kevin first, what was the sort of demographic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=24.28s)]
*  that you identified or who's the audience you're going after with this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=29.12s)]
*  Because there's a lot of there's a lot in the sports and entertainment space. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  What gap did you see? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=36.8s)]
*  We don't have a target demographic, but we just wanted to build a place where people [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=37.8s)]
*  can come and see the intersection between all of these things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=42.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=45.88s)]
*  So Rich, why am I the target demographic? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=46.88s)]
*  Well you will be. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=50.24s)]
*  I mean, I think like the backstory for us was that I grew up in talent management and music [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=51.24s)]
*  and sports and in managing talent got to experience opening a restaurant, producing a film. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=57.28s)]
*  And there was never one part of it that I loved and one part of it that I didn't love. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=62.64s)]
*  I loved it all. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=66.4s)]
*  I loved the action around the hip hop culture and sport culture that I grew up in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=67.4s)]
*  But what happened was when we partnered and some of the places that we were able to go, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=72.16s)]
*  it dawned on us that it was sports ultimately that got us in these rooms. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  And I think if young me and young Kevin had known that all of these worlds intersected [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=80.56s)]
*  the way they did, that it would have been something that we would have consumed as much [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=84.76s)]
*  of it as we could. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=88.48s)]
*  So the idea was to just create a brand that really embodied that intersection, truly embodied [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=89.48s)]
*  it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=94.2s)]
*  Like we live in it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=95.2s)]
*  A lot of people like to talk about it, but being a professional basketball player, being [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=96.2s)]
*  someone that's been around the music and sports space for 27 years, I think we had the right [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=98.88s)]
*  perspective and look at it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=104.28s)]
*  And I think it's always going to be rooted in sports. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=105.88s)]
*  But as you've seen us evolve now into talking more about business and tech and fashion and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=107.92s)]
*  art and music, that's where I see our demo continuing to expand. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=111.92s)]
*  And I think we've always looked at it a little bit like the modern day sports fan who doesn't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=115.52s)]
*  need to watch every game. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=118.96s)]
*  But the culture of sport, same reason why we're sitting here on this panel, is something [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=120.92s)]
*  that has great influence. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=125.0s)]
*  So I think it was always built to be centered around sport at the core to talk about all [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  the worlds that intersect with it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=131.56s)]
*  So Kevin, I know you've never taken any outside capital for Boredom. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=133.2s)]
*  Will you ever? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=139.56s)]
*  At some point, who knows? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=140.56s)]
*  But for now, we want to continue to keep building. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=144.28s)]
*  We like the progress that we've made so far. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=147.08s)]
*  We've done so much in a short period of time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=150.0s)]
*  We've worked so hard that we want to keep building and see where this can go. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=153.36s)]
*  You can decide who answers this question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=158.8s)]
*  Is it more of a B2B play or a B2C play? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=161.52s)]
*  And tell us a bit more about the revenue model. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=164.08s)]
*  We built it originally as a traditional digital media platform, but we also had the insight [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=168.04s)]
*  from being investors at the same time that that probably was not going to be a sustainable [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  or investable model, being that the media landscape was changing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  But to create a brand from scratch that truly resonated, that was able to galvanize artists [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=181.48s)]
*  and athletes to want to be a part of it, we had to build it through some of those traditional [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=186.44s)]
*  methods. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=190.44s)]
*  So putting out a daily newsletter, putting out short form video, putting out editorial. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=191.44s)]
*  But when the business started to really evolve is when we brought it into the physical. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=195.52s)]
*  So I think there is a B2B component in that our events integrate both consumer and industry, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  and it allows us to create revenue streams from partners that come to our events. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=205.52s)]
*  But the idea is that our events, then you see them on social, you see them in our content, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  people want to be at our events, and it brings more of a brand affinity to the actual brand. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=213.56s)]
*  And we didn't raise money because we knew that, and we also knew that that was not going [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=217.56s)]
*  to be the way to truly create a brand that connected with the community. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't about money. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=224.88s)]
*  It was about committing consistently to doing things and showing up where our brand was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=225.88s)]
*  relevant. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=230.32s)]
*  And if we did that over and over and over again and did it authentically, starting with [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=231.32s)]
*  the two of us, that the brand would resonate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  And once that has, now it's about figuring out how to truly monetize it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=237.2s)]
*  And when brands are partnering with us, they're investing into the whole ecosystem. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=240.92s)]
*  They may want branded content. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=244.72s)]
*  They may want to show up at our events and parties. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=246.16s)]
*  They may want a level of strategy from us or talent alignment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=248.12s)]
*  But I think at some point, there'll be a partner for us where our brand fits nicely [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=252.2s)]
*  aligned with it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=255.92s)]
*  And if that comes about, we'll look at it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=256.92s)]
*  But right now, we fund it with the revenue we get from brands. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=258.8s)]
*  Brands pay us to be within our content, our events, or as an advisory consultant basis. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=261.96s)]
*  And next year, we'll look to launch one or two new revenue streams, probably around membership [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=266.8s)]
*  and products, something we're really excited about. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=271.36s)]
*  So you launched the company in 2019. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  To what extent, Kevin, did the pandemic kind of turbocharge its inception? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=278.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was just having a platform to just be present, you know? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  I think just being around, just having a place where people could come and get information [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  and trust that information that they're getting as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=296.08s)]
*  So you know, it was a pandemic was obviously a tough time for everybody, but everybody [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  was looking for places to, you know, receive information. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  I think that's we became an outlet for people to they trust what we're doing, they trust [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=307.48s)]
*  what we say and continue to keep building from there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=312.6s)]
*  And I noticed as well, when you're on the website, there's, you know, people are very [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=316.08s)]
*  much encouraged to sign up for the newsletters. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=321.0s)]
*  Is that a data collection exercise? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's still like a very personal relationship you can have digitally, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=326.12s)]
*  having somebody's email and being able to directly communicate with them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=330.44s)]
*  I also think that, you know, the newsletters that we put out one a day for the entire week, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=333.44s)]
*  one that's focused around tech, one that's focused around the business of sneaker culture, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  one that's a bit more of a curated newsfeed of all the things we love, which is, I do [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=343.28s)]
*  think, something you would like that product. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=347.52s)]
*  And the idea for that is that, like, we're continuing to build our audience and community. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=350.44s)]
*  What we don't want to do is just build new IP within boardroom or build new shows and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=354.44s)]
*  get brands to sponsor it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=359.02s)]
*  I think our brand, boardroom, is the brand that has the value. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=360.56s)]
*  So what we try to do is create as many boardroom products that we give the consumers as [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=363.84s)]
*  frequently as possible. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=367.84s)]
*  OK, so here's something that I like and something that I appreciate very much in the way [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=369.52s)]
*  you to approach things. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=374.44s)]
*  And that's your attitude towards women's sport, which you're very much you treat as an [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=375.68s)]
*  equal to men's sport, which, you know, having worked in newspapers, I can tell you, is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=380.2s)]
*  highly unusual. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=384.96s)]
*  Tell me, I mean, Kevin, do you think I mean, whether it's basketball or elsewhere, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  soccer, do you do you feel like women's sport is now finally being taken, given the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=391.4s)]
*  same amount of attention that men's sport is getting there? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  I think we still got a ways to go to finally to really hit its potential. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=399.68s)]
*  But I think it's getting there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  The respect for the sport, you know, more respect for the sport is starting to gain [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  over time. You know, you see how hard these women work every single day. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=410.28s)]
*  You get to see the content they make inside their lives. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  You see how they work every single day. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=416.04s)]
*  And, you know, so the respect is is growing every single day and that's going to help [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=418.0s)]
*  the business as well. So, yeah, I see it growing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=422.24s)]
*  I see it eventually competing with the men's sports. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=424.32s)]
*  But we still got a long ways to go. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=428.44s)]
*  And I think it's on us to continue to keep pushing that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  And we use our platforms to do so. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=432.56s)]
*  I mean, I can't I can't not ask you about Caitlin Clark and, you know, how the excitement [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=435.0s)]
*  that she generated for the WNBA. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you think I mean, what more can be done now to build on that excitement around her? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=442.48s)]
*  And I've got to ask, should you have been picked for the Olympics? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=446.72s)]
*  I still think it's proper steps you got to take in our world to be considered an [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=450.92s)]
*  Olympian. I think she's going to definitely be on one of these teams going forward. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=455.32s)]
*  But right now, it was better candidates out there, I think. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=458.92s)]
*  But Caitlin, Caitlin's got to continue to keep showing up every day. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=461.6s)]
*  You know, the WNBA is doing a great job of showcasing her. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  I see in her games on ESPN every other day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=469.68s)]
*  I've seen talks around her. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=472.56s)]
*  No matter what they're talking about, there's a lot of dialogue around the game right [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=474.52s)]
*  now. So that's that's good as well. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=478.72s)]
*  But I think she could continue to keep getting better as a player. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=480.2s)]
*  Her production on the court gets better. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=482.88s)]
*  Then the league will grow, along with some of the other women as well who are coming [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=485.32s)]
*  in. Asia Wilson is just so many great players in our league that Caitlin has helped [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=488.72s)]
*  shine that light on them. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=492.64s)]
*  And that'll help the league grow over time. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=494.68s)]
*  Rich, do you think there's still lots of growth in women's sport? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=496.8s)]
*  Yeah, of course, there's a ton of growth. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=500.92s)]
*  But I think as important and what will help that growth a lot will be more of an [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=502.8s)]
*  education. And I think what you're seeing is this like lack of education around the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=507.32s)]
*  sport and a bit of a layman's like approach to thinking the idea that Caitlin Clark [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=511.64s)]
*  would have made the Olympic team is just not realistic. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=515.76s)]
*  She wasn't one of the 12 best players in the WNBA, nor should she have probably [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=518.24s)]
*  assumed she would be as a rookie. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=522.4s)]
*  And I think that's where the education is still off. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=524.36s)]
*  Right. The fact that someone thinks that Caitlin Clark may be the best player in the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=527.24s)]
*  world because they're not looking at the sport the same way that they look at men [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=530.28s)]
*  sports. And I think for us, even before all of this focus the last few years, we [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  found it a very relevant part of the conversation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=538.6s)]
*  And our goal at boardroom is to curate all the things that we believe are relevant [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=541.36s)]
*  to talk about and important to talk about. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=545.12s)]
*  And women's sports has been something that we've loved as fans for a long time. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=547.52s)]
*  We invested because it was great business opportunities. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=550.8s)]
*  It happened to be in women's sports. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=553.92s)]
*  But as a fan, 10, 12 years ago on his Nike tours, we would always stop at the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=555.72s)]
*  girls nationals. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=560.4s)]
*  Kevin's always been a supporter of the W before everyone's attention was turned to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=561.48s)]
*  it. So we know the sport. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=565.8s)]
*  But I think it's important to bring the stories and the stakes and the rivalries and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=567.88s)]
*  the education to the consumer, because when you're armed with that, then you become a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=571.6s)]
*  real fan. And that's still missing a bit from women's sports. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  So you're both, you know, big investors in through your your start in startups who [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=579.12s)]
*  this other the 35 Ventures outfit. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=584.0s)]
*  What are you thinking of? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=588.0s)]
*  Where are you going to look next for future investments and startups? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  Kevin. One investing teams going forward. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sports teams has really been our goal from the beginning when we started [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=600.44s)]
*  investing. You know, but I mean, who knows? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think that you're going to reveal something for us. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=607.96s)]
*  Give us a scoop. Maybe we want to own a team one day, but we got a lot of work [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=612.36s)]
*  to do. You want to own an NBA team one day, but we got a lot of work to do. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=617.8s)]
*  And I think the investing in sports teams has been a win, like a win, win, win for [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=621.04s)]
*  us because we believe in the investments. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=626.52s)]
*  But in terms of gaining audience, we've been able to tap into the communities of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  Gotham FC, of the Philadelphia Union, of PLL, the professional lacrosse league. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=633.56s)]
*  And I think it's also given us like an incredible visibility into what it could [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=639.52s)]
*  look like in the future, because when we made an investment in the Philadelphia [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=643.16s)]
*  Union, he was sitting with the coach and the GM talking to them about how they [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  operate their team on the performance side. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=649.76s)]
*  And I was sitting there talking to the CEO and the head of operations and we're [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=651.88s)]
*  educating and we're also then using our platform to help amplify the team. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=655.56s)]
*  And I think that is what new media is. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  Like, we've been shameless in saying, look, this is our platform. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=661.36s)]
*  We're going to support Gotham FC because we've made an investment in them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think what it does is allow the consumer to believe everything else we say, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=667.8s)]
*  because if we're going to be very open about the fact that we're going to support [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=671.5999999999999s)]
*  teams we invested in more so than maybe another team, even though we'll support [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=674.64s)]
*  the whole league. And that's been something I think from an investment [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=678.6s)]
*  standpoint, that's been an advantage to us. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=681.64s)]
*  Because I think other teams that have reached out to us see that we really are [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=683.12s)]
*  not just trying to put money on the cap table, but that we really want to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=686.32s)]
*  understand the business they're in and be like a true valued investor. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=689.84s)]
*  And are you for now sticking to the US or have you thought about investing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=693.6s)]
*  outside the US? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, definitely thought about it. But for now, just sticking to the US. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=698.44s)]
*  Who knows, we can expand at any time. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=702.16s)]
*  While you're here. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=704.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=705.64s)]
*  I mean, F1 is not a US thing, but something that we're like, obviously. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=706.64s)]
*  It's growing in the US. Big time. Really growing. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=709.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=712.04s)]
*  So like, that's an example of like F1 and the Grammys and weekends like that, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  or how we're starting to expand our brand into different audiences, because the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=718.0s)]
*  business of is something we can speak about universally. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  So F1 has been a kind of flagship moment on the calendar where we've activated [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=724.92s)]
*  and it's been really powerful for us. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=730.44s)]
*  But also what's so interesting about F1 is it was popularized in the US through [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=731.6400000000001s)]
*  the Netflix documentary. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=735.24s)]
*  So, you know, it's very much your world. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=738.5200000000001s)]
*  Talking of which, I mean, Kevin, you know, the Apple TV show Swagger about a high [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=739.5200000000001s)]
*  school basketball prodigy was said to be inspired by your experience. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=745.08s)]
*  And obviously it was, you know, people love stories of athletes. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=749.6s)]
*  Who do you think of the athletes, aside from yourself, who are out there who are [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=753.08s)]
*  telling their stories well? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=756.6400000000001s)]
*  So many, so many, in the name of a few, I mean, LeBron James, Michael Jordan. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=758.68s)]
*  God bless his soul, Kobe Bryant, a story still being told every day. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=765.92s)]
*  I mean, so many players that former players, present players [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=769.24s)]
*  that tell their stories, inspiring people around the world. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  Definitely what I wanted to do as we started to build our business is not just [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=779.92s)]
*  telling my story, but the story that, you know, so many different stories intersect [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=784.16s)]
*  the game of basketball and business. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=787.68s)]
*  And Swagger was one of those shows that I wanted people to know just the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=789.16s)]
*  journey it takes to get to where we are. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=794.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, so the more and more of those stories, the more inspiring we can do [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  around the world and the bigger we can we can make this thing. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=799.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I miss, you know, so many guys in my business that's doing the same [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=801.68s)]
*  thing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=805.16s)]
*  So you were an executive producer on that show. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  How involved were you and what was the experience like? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=808.8399999999999s)]
*  It was incredible. So from day one, me and Reggie, the director producer, we sat [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=811.76s)]
*  down and we just went over every story that I had as a kid coming up in the youth [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=817.28s)]
*  basketball scene. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=821.4s)]
*  And he put it together and from day one, from picking the cast to the location, to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=822.4s)]
*  everything, we were involved. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=827.28s)]
*  And that's what made it special to us. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=828.48s)]
*  And to get it on Apple and to see the reception tool was incredible. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=830.04s)]
*  And I just got calls when there was problems. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=835.04s)]
*  That's honestly all that happened. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=838.52s)]
*  Did they send you the scripts? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=840.92s)]
*  Yeah, we were we were involved early, especially just because, like, the show [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=843.16s)]
*  was birthed out of the idea that his rec center growing up was really where he [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=847.16s)]
*  experienced life and understood and learned everything. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=851.7199999999999s)]
*  And all I heard was stories from him and his friends of this rec center. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=854.7199999999999s)]
*  So I think it was about honoring it in the beginning and making sure that it [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  didn't go off course a bit. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=861.0s)]
*  But Reggie did an incredible job. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=862.64s)]
*  But Apple apparently didn't seem to think so after season two. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=865.04s)]
*  Oh, really? Oh, well, take it somewhere else. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=868.0s)]
*  All right. My bad. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=871.4s)]
*  So I'm going to get a little bit more technical now, which is about the NBA close [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=872.4s)]
*  to finalizing its long term TV deals. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=880.52s)]
*  And I think we're getting to a point now where for the first time ever, some [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  consumers may need a streaming subscription to watch some national NBA games. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=887.12s)]
*  And I'm curious to know from both of you whether you think consumers are ready for [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=892.0s)]
*  that. I think so. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  What I know about NBA fans is they find the game, they find it anywhere. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=898.68s)]
*  And I think the NBA does a good job of presenting the game to its consumers. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=903.4s)]
*  So the more, you know, places that you can watch the games, you know, so many people [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=908.04s)]
*  got different apps that don't, you know, people have TNT, you know, so the more [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=913.92s)]
*  the better, I think. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=919.56s)]
*  I think we're spreading the game across the world and we get more and more [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  viewers every single day. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=923.52s)]
*  That's the reason why we have such a huge TV show. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=924.76s)]
*  That's the reason why we have such a huge TV deal right now. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=927.0s)]
*  So I think it's going to be incredible for the league going forward. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=929.52s)]
*  I think, I mean, the more the better. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=932.84s)]
*  But isn't it also very confusing for consumers? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=934.2s)]
*  You know, you've got to have so many different subscriptions now. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=936.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what your view on that is, Rich. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=938.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is confusing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=940.96s)]
*  I think when there was a thousand channels on broadcast cable in the beginning, it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=942.92s)]
*  was confusing for me as well. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=947.56s)]
*  And I think this is just part of the evolution of how consumers are going to get [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=949.2s)]
*  their content from now on. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=953.8s)]
*  I do think the streaming services need to do a better job of educating the offering [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=955.08s)]
*  and the opportunity. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=959.84s)]
*  There needs to be a better user experience overall, but we will evolve with it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=960.6s)]
*  And like he said, I think that's why they can get seven and a half billion dollars [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=965.08s)]
*  because there's nothing else that can replicate it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=969.96s)]
*  It's why Warner and Turner are having the controversy around whether they get it or [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=972.96s)]
*  not get it because it's that big of a deal. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=978.36s)]
*  It can put a network out, you know, in some ways, and it can also completely elevate a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=980.24s)]
*  network. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=984.24s)]
*  I think we all only know TNT because of the NBA. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=984.6s)]
*  So it is confusing for sure. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=989.76s)]
*  I mean, I think even the announcement that Warner ESPN and NBC made, you know, that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=992.24s)]
*  I understood at that time. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=997.5600000000001s)]
*  But since they announced it till now, it's yet to launch and it all of a sudden [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=999.32s)]
*  doesn't make all the sense in the world. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, so I think that technology is just evolving. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1005.08s)]
*  This is all evolving so quickly and so fast that we'll have to keep up with it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1008.24s)]
*  But I do think these tech companies need to do a way better job of kind of educating [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1012.92s)]
*  us on the offering. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1016.8s)]
*  So something else that's evolving very quickly is sports betting in the U.S. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  And the NBA has just been through its first real scandal with a lifetime ban on a [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1022.8399999999999s)]
*  player. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1029.32s)]
*  Are you concerned that this could turn into a wider problem? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1031.08s)]
*  How much more of a problem can it get? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1036.56s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1038.56s)]
*  I mean, once they introduced it the first time, then they opened the gates for [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1045.08s)]
*  everything, you know, so like everything we learn how to adapt, you know, I don't [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1048.72s)]
*  think it's affected the product. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe the watching experience may change for the consumer, the viewer, but I don't [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1055.6399999999999s)]
*  think the product has changed and I don't think as much we can do about it, to be [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1061.12s)]
*  honest. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1064.08s)]
*  Do you agree, Mitch? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1064.76s)]
*  Do you think the horse is bolted? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, they caught him, which I think like people tend to forget the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1066.76s)]
*  system is not broken. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1071.6399999999999s)]
*  He used a legal gambling platform and the algorithm was like, this doesn't sound [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1073.04s)]
*  right. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1078.7199999999998s)]
*  And he got in trouble. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1079.12s)]
*  But I think it brings more eyeballs and focus and where I think the big [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1080.76s)]
*  opportunity is, is going to be around gambling on women's sports, because [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1085.0s)]
*  however you look at it, it brings people's attention to the product and it creates [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1088.36s)]
*  stakes and rivalries and it makes you focus in a bit more on what the outcome [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  should be or can be. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  But I don't see it being a bigger problem. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1101.2399999999998s)]
*  It's been so rampant in society, whether it was legalized or not legalized, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1103.56s)]
*  everyone always had access to gamble and honestly, players were gambling. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1107.4399999999998s)]
*  But it's not something that they do across the board. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1112.1999999999998s)]
*  And I don't see it as a bigger issue. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  I see it as a lot more money coming into the league for sure. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1117.1999999999998s)]
*  So I'm curious to ask you, but you've obviously been partners in business and [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1121.08s)]
*  before that in sport. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1126.04s)]
*  The transition from being a professional athlete to life afterwards is not an [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1129.12s)]
*  easy or obvious one. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1134.36s)]
*  And a lot of people don't. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1135.6s)]
*  You've obviously made a great success of it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1136.6799999999998s)]
*  What advice would you give? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1139.2399999999998s)]
*  Because it's certainly some athletes don't make that transition very [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1141.9599999999998s)]
*  successfully. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1144.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you think is the key? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  Transitioning to retirement. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1148.1200000000001s)]
*  Steady on. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1152.88s)]
*  Me? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  I still feel like I got a few more years. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1156.76s)]
*  Well, I know you're still playing. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1158.3600000000001s)]
*  But from what I've heard, it's a tough experience. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1163.0800000000002s)]
*  You're setting yourself up for the future. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1167.4s)]
*  I'm trying to. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1169.3200000000002s)]
*  Setting yourself up for the future. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1170.1200000000001s)]
*  I know it'll be a tough transition because, you know, I do this every day. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1171.64s)]
*  This is what I'm focused on is getting better at my craft every day. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1177.0s)]
*  So we don't have to do that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1180.0s)]
*  I know it'll be a total change. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1181.24s)]
*  There'll be something for you to land on. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1182.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  So we're setting it up right now. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1184.16s)]
*  So, you know, other stuff that I'm interested in, I can jump in pretty quickly. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1185.5600000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I know it's going to be a tough transition. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1190.04s)]
*  How much time do you, how do you divide your time at the moment between, you [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  know, sport and business? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  And something is different for different days. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1198.88s)]
*  I just text him 50 times a day and he responds to the amount that he [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1202.48s)]
*  wants. That's the balance. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1206.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1208.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll call him at three hours of the morning and just just vent or talk [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1209.68s)]
*  about whatever. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1214.2s)]
*  You know, it's like that for us. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's how I think we built our business is just organically just having [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1216.5600000000002s)]
*  conversation about what we like to do. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  What's on our minds. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's just built from there. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1223.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, and I think that's how our relationship grew as men as well. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1224.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1227.5200000000002s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1228.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, not, you know, more generally about how, you know, how, what's the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1228.7600000000002s)]
*  contribution that people like Kevin and other athletes, you know, in a wider [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1233.8799999999999s)]
*  sort of perspective can. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1239.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think, well, I think it's changed even as he's gotten older, you [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1240.8s)]
*  know, your ability, your capacity to kind of balance them both emotionally and [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1245.56s)]
*  talk about certain things, but be able to stay as locked in, maybe harder for [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1250.0s)]
*  some players earlier in their career. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1253.44s)]
*  And I think that's probably in some ways a good thing, because I do think part of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1255.08s)]
*  the process is that like, it doesn't get lost on us that even though I believe [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1259.2s)]
*  I'm incredibly talented, what he's been able to do on the basketball court has [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1263.28s)]
*  allowed us to build and has powered and fueled so much of what we've built. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1268.68s)]
*  So it was important to always honor that first. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1273.12s)]
*  And it doesn't even need to be set when he's checked out or he doesn't want to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1275.96s)]
*  talk business, we won't talk business, but it's naive sometimes with people to [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1279.52s)]
*  think that he couldn't manage being one of the best basketball players in the world [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1284.28s)]
*  and taking a 20 minute phone call every other day from me or a partner of someone [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1287.6399999999999s)]
*  that we have to speak to. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1292.1599999999999s)]
*  But early in career, because of the opportunities that are coming to these [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1293.36s)]
*  athletes and because of how astute they are and knowledgeable about business, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1296.52s)]
*  which I don't think people understand. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1300.56s)]
*  These are like 17, 18 year old kids that know more about business and the struggles [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1301.8s)]
*  and money than any of us did at those ages, but they almost have too much [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1307.0s)]
*  information and you still have to like honor your craft and do that first. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1311.04s)]
*  But I think what happens is by the time you get to this point in Kevin's career, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  he's already learned how to balance it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1318.1999999999998s)]
*  And it's not like basketball will be gone when he's done playing. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1320.24s)]
*  He won't be playing, but it'll be still such a part of his life that it'll always [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1322.8000000000002s)]
*  be a balance. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1326.04s)]
*  So, Kevin, I've got to ask you've had some pretty tense interactions with sports [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1327.64s)]
*  journalists in the past. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1331.48s)]
*  How would you describe the relationship between athletes and sports media, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  at least in the NBA right now? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1339.2s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1342.76s)]
*  I think you have a lot of guys telling their own stories and pushing their own [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1343.4s)]
*  narratives and I feel like the stories could be told the right way from the guys [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1350.3200000000002s)]
*  that are actually in it, you know, and I think media also plays a part as well as [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1357.72s)]
*  telling it from their perspective outside of the arena, outside of the court, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1364.0400000000002s)]
*  outside the lines, and that plays a part as well. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1367.88s)]
*  But I think both sides have been working with each other pretty well in our [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1370.84s)]
*  business to push the game forward. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1374.12s)]
*  And I think that's what I like to see. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1376.56s)]
*  I see, for example, Draymond Green, what he's doing with his podcast and Paul [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1377.84s)]
*  George, so many players that are telling their own stories and doing it the right [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1382.28s)]
*  way to have. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1386.4399999999998s)]
*  They make it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1386.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe it can build a career after the game. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1387.4399999999998s)]
*  That's what I love about it. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1389.8s)]
*  And that's inspiring so many young guys as well to tell their own stories and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1391.0s)]
*  control their narratives as well. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1394.4399999999998s)]
*  So, yeah, I like to, I like what the relations are and it's good to tell the [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1395.84s)]
*  truth. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1399.8799999999999s)]
*  I think I think most of the time when I have these stats, I guess, with the [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1400.28s)]
*  journalists, I try to try my hardest to tell the truth about the game. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1405.64s)]
*  And, you know, they respect me for it at the end of the day. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1409.6s)]
*  Always a good idea to tell the truth. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1412.2s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1413.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1414.76s)]
*  Look, I am guessing that there are people in the crowd who would like to ask [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1416.36s)]
*  questions of Kevin or Rich. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1420.56s)]
*  So if you've got any questions here. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1422.24s)]
*  Hi, guys. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1427.04s)]
*  I'm Kat Randall from PopVenture. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1427.6s)]
*  So, Kevin, we utilize you as the champion of entrepreneurship and [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1429.96s)]
*  entrepreneurs in so many of our pitches because we really love your investment [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1435.8s)]
*  strategy and how you have invested in so many companies. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1440.2s)]
*  I'm curious, what is the thing that motivates you around finding newer or, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, you guys talked about things like F1, but you have invested in so [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1449.24s)]
*  many like small businesses that are up and coming, doing different things. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1453.08s)]
*  Why is that tie back to the community so important to you? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1457.76s)]
*  And how do you plan to take that forward? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1460.72s)]
*  I see you really like we talk about you all the time. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1463.1200000000001s)]
*  We're like, you guys know about Kevin Durant. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1465.4s)]
*  He's like the greatest guy when it comes to investing in small [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1467.32s)]
*  business, like SMEs. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1470.32s)]
*  So tell us. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1471.88s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to align myself with people that got good values, that want [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1472.48s)]
*  to help grow the earth in general, that want to build community. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1476.3600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, so we, we run across so many people with bright ideas and, and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1480.56s)]
*  simply just want to empower them to do their best and, and you don't see what [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1486.04s)]
*  happens after that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  So you're just, just trying to find good people. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1490.44s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1493.0s)]
*  Any other questions? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1497.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1498.0s)]
*  Hi, yeah, my name's Steve Griffith from a fish tank, London. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1498.2s)]
*  So we're an entrepreneurial incubator working with communities to build young [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1501.92s)]
*  entrepreneurs from disadvantaged communities. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1506.68s)]
*  I'm doing it very well at the moment. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1509.0s)]
*  I really love what you're saying about community and bring community forward. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1511.08s)]
*  Recently in London, we've had 777 come into the, into London to look at how they [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1515.04s)]
*  build the infrastructure for basketball, which I think is a quite interesting [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1520.44s)]
*  concept around, as you both alluded to, sportsmen, entrepreneurs, and really good [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1523.92s)]
*  businessmen, especially very young. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1530.8s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, is there something in that in terms of your sort of, your [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1532.72s)]
*  own business sort of ideas to work with community, to grow community, not just [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1536.76s)]
*  with basketball, with other ventures as well, as someone just mentioned? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1542.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've built 35 and refurbished 35 basketball courts in some of [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1547.24s)]
*  the most underserved communities around the world. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1552.76s)]
*  We just got back from Stockholm where we built two courts in what they call the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1554.52s)]
*  no-go zone where the police don't even go. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1559.08s)]
*  And when Kevin surprised these 150 kids that didn't know he was coming, it was [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1561.24s)]
*  about as rewarding of an experience as you could ever have in life. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1565.96s)]
*  I think what we've tried to do is arm them with as many resources possible. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1569.72s)]
*  When we were in the Bay, we partnered with Lorene Jobs and took her college [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  track program to Suitland, Maryland. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1577.36s)]
*  And we built a built, bought a building there, put the college track program in [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1579.68s)]
*  the ground floor and then built not-for-profit programming throughout the building. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1584.08s)]
*  And I think what we've seen is our role. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1587.44s)]
*  Obviously Kevin himself is inspiring and he's put his own money where his mouth is. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1590.24s)]
*  But I think for us, it's about bringing all the people in our ecosystem and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1594.44s)]
*  bringing all the resources and just arming these kids with things that they [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1598.28s)]
*  just frankly would never get, you know, education around certain things that [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1601.24s)]
*  will give them a bit of a differentiator as they go into life. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1604.76s)]
*  And I do agree that building these basketball courts and building these parks, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1607.92s)]
*  while it seems a bit simple, it sits there as this like pillar of like a symbol [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1611.3999999999999s)]
*  that, you know what, Kevin came here, he cared about us. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1617.08s)]
*  And you could see that with these kids in Sweden the other day. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1619.76s)]
*  It was just like a miracle had happened that day and like however long that they [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1622.92s)]
*  could take that moment with them, maybe the rest of their life. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1627.56s)]
*  I think for us, it's just about repeating those things over and over again. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1630.4s)]
*  Got questions over here? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1638.76s)]
*  Over here. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1639.8s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1640.28s)]
*  Question about a little bit more around business, what's happening in college [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1640.88s)]
*  basketball or college sports with NIL. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1645.8s)]
*  How do you see that changing the way in which what was an amateur system, which [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1648.72s)]
*  is now a professional system starting in college affecting both players coming [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1654.08s)]
*  into the NBA, salaries, because these kids are making a lot of money and they're [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1659.0s)]
*  sophomores and freshmen in college. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1664.12s)]
*  So how do you see the future of NIL impacting the league? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1666.08s)]
*  I think didn't they just pass a rule where the colleges can pay the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1670.8799999999999s)]
*  players directly now, right? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1674.32s)]
*  So you don't have to go through companies to get, I think that's a game changer [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1675.76s)]
*  as well because you go directly to the colleges now and negotiate a contract. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1680.04s)]
*  But I don't think it'll affect what we do in the NBA or business in the NBA. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1684.48s)]
*  I think that's a whole separate thing. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1688.44s)]
*  I like the idea of players start to profit off of what they do at the amateur level. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1690.64s)]
*  I think they starting to become more business astute earlier, like you said, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1697.36s)]
*  15, 16 years old now, meeting guys with agents and they got plans for their [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1701.16s)]
*  business moving forward. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1705.84s)]
*  They're asking questions that I wouldn't even have known to ask at that age. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1707.1599999999999s)]
*  But it's pros and cons of everything. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1711.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, it can be, you know, it can cause, you could dilute the game. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1713.0s)]
*  It can, you know, cause players not even to have drive to play the game of [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1719.08s)]
*  basketball no more. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1723.2399999999998s)]
*  It's a lack that can happen. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1724.08s)]
*  But, you know, you can look at the positive sides as well and see how it's [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1725.12s)]
*  benefiting these kids all across the country at all levels. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1729.0s)]
*  And I'll just add to that. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1733.52s)]
*  I think a lot of times when people talk about their feelings and their [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1734.76s)]
*  sentiments on NAL, they're instantly talking about football and basketball. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1738.44s)]
*  And I think what it's really meant to do is give an opportunity to all of the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1742.48s)]
*  college athletes. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1747.2s)]
*  Basketball and football have been run like a business forever. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1749.04s)]
*  Even when it was an NAL, it was as much of a business and as transactional, it [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1751.4s)]
*  was just under the table. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1756.04s)]
*  I think right now it's this weird purgatory because there's no regulation. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1758.24s)]
*  It's like in New York, they legalized marijuana, but they didn't actually put [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1762.44s)]
*  any guidelines in place. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1767.0s)]
*  So there was 700 smoke shops opened and now they're closing them all. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1768.2s)]
*  And in a lot of ways, that's what's happening in college basketball. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1771.52s)]
*  There's this whole time period now where no one knows what they're doing. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1774.08s)]
*  So whoever has the most money is paying players and getting players. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1776.76s)]
*  But the trickle down effect to women's volleyball and men's soccer and women's [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1780.44s)]
*  tennis and lacrosse and field hockey is having a real impact because these were [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1785.6s)]
*  kids that if they had the personality to build a social influencer channel for [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1789.72s)]
*  themselves to make money while they were in college, if they, God forbid, took a [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1793.32s)]
*  $20 check, they could lose their eligibility. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1797.04s)]
*  And that didn't get any press. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1799.24s)]
*  You only heard about Reggie Bush. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1800.4s)]
*  So I think it's just been a part of the game. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1802.52s)]
*  I think regulation is needed badly. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1804.64s)]
*  Every coach that I've spoken to, they say you would never expect them to respond. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1806.6000000000001s)]
*  They go, no idea what's going on. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1811.44s)]
*  I mean, these are the top D1 coaches in the world. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1813.2s)]
*  No idea what's going on. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  We're just going until they tell us what to do. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1816.32s)]
*  So I think that's where like the problem has to be fixed. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1818.52s)]
*  I think we've got another question over here. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1822.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1823.68s)]
*  So, yeah, thanks, Kevin. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1823.92s)]
*  Thanks, Rich. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1825.4s)]
*  So just to expand on some of the other questions around investing in small [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1826.72s)]
*  businesses in terms of your scope, is that sort of just US based or is that sort of [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1832.0400000000002s)]
*  global in terms of when you look at businesses? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1839.5600000000002s)]
*  Are you looking for investment? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1842.48s)]
*  No. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1844.28s)]
*  Oh, I mean, we we've seen obviously more companies. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1846.84s)]
*  Are you wearing a bangles jersey? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1851.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we like it. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1853.0s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1854.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I just thought it was dope. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1855.96s)]
*  I like it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1857.0s)]
*  We see obviously majority of our deal flow domestically, and we also have kind of made [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1859.24s)]
*  it clear that we're really focused on like sports and sports adjacent businesses. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1866.6s)]
*  Obviously, when we were in the Valley, we built tremendous deal flow. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1870.92s)]
*  My good friend, Chris Lyons, right here from a 16 was really early on in building its [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1874.4s)]
*  deal flow pipeline for us. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think we really showed Chris how powerful someone like Kevin could be if they [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1880.4s)]
*  rolled their sleeves up and didn't just lend their name. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1884.3200000000002s)]
*  But we see things. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1887.24s)]
*  I think it's just about spending more time. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1888.64s)]
*  You know, I think what goes like law sometimes is you do have to develop real [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1890.44s)]
*  relationships in venture as well. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1894.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, I think out here, everybody's networking and trying to get access to [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1896.84s)]
*  brands. But the same way we approach our relationships with brands is how we [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1900.96s)]
*  approach investors and venture capital firms and other founders. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1905.12s)]
*  So I think the more time we spend internationally and we start meeting some of [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1908.32s)]
*  these young founders, because that's the beautiful part of our deal flow now is [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1912.1599999999999s)]
*  it's not from VC firms. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1915.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, Chris is probably the exception. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1917.28s)]
*  It is from founders that have talked about the impact Kevin's had on their life or [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1918.8s)]
*  what our business has been able to do or how powerful boardroom was in marketing it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1922.9199999999998s)]
*  So the more we expand that conversation, I think we'll see more deal flow. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1926.8s)]
*  Right. Oh, one more question. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1932.2s)]
*  I think we've got time for. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1933.72s)]
*  Both in terms of how you think about your future and potentially an ownership [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1945.0s)]
*  position of an NBA team. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1948.68s)]
*  But to what degree does he engage with you and others on the team with some of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1950.72s)]
*  the ideas and some of the ways, you know, including access to games, you know, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1954.84s)]
*  in different ways? Is he involved you in that process? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1959.9599999999998s)]
*  Any things that you're learning from him or. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1963.6s)]
*  Not necessarily involve me in that type of process. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1965.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we obviously what goes on with the team, the day to day operations with the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1968.32s)]
*  team we talk about. And Matt is such a great guy. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1972.24s)]
*  He doesn't mind a suggestion here and there. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1977.36s)]
*  But it was his idea with the Arizona family network to get the games free to everybody [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1980.72s)]
*  in the state of Arizona. I thought that was an incredible idea to expand our fan base [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  a little bit more in Arizona. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1990.24s)]
*  But the day to day, he's calling me every day about what players are like or what do [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1992.2s)]
*  you think about he's watching film, you watching basketball. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=1997.16s)]
*  So to have an owner that is really that invested in the players from every aspect, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  everybody that works for the Suns he's invested in. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2005.28s)]
*  He's built a new facility for the women's for the Mercury downtown, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2007.6s)]
*  100 million dollar facility for them. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2011.28s)]
*  Got a new G League team this year. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2013.12s)]
*  So he really wants to make a winner in Phoenix and the owners that come in there [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2014.76s)]
*  and just hit the ground running and start spending immediately. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2018.9199999999998s)]
*  Those are the ones that usually have success. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2022.44s)]
*  It might not start early on, but in the long term, it's a sustainable model for you [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2024.12s)]
*  to continue to just be involved every day. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2028.6399999999999s)]
*  He's one of those guys that's in it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0VUpCn03o&t=2030.8s)]
