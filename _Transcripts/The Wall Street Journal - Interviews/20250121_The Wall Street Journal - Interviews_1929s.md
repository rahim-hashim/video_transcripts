# Coinbase CEO on the Future of Crypto Under Trump Administration | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo)
*  But let's start with the fun. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=0.0s)]
*  How was the crypto inaugural ball? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  I just came from DC yesterday and the energy was palpable, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=4.84s)]
*  as you can imagine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=10.6s)]
*  We co-sponsored the crypto ball there [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=11.6s)]
*  and it was just an incredible event, tons of energy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=13.76s)]
*  It felt like the boot had been lifted off our throat in a way. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=17.2s)]
*  Like the last four years, the lack of clear rules, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=20.88s)]
*  I think, was really weaponized by Gary Gensler and some folks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=24.16s)]
*  in the administration. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  And it felt like we repeatedly petitioned them [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=28.64s)]
*  for clear rules, like people wanted to build companies, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=31.8s)]
*  and it was all getting pushed offshore [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=34.24s)]
*  because they were really unlawfully attacking [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=35.86s)]
*  the industry, trying to kill it, in my view. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=38.44s)]
*  And so it was a ton of energy and enthusiasm [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=40.32s)]
*  about this new direction, like a new SEC chair that's pro crypto, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=43.06s)]
*  people like David Sachs as the cryptos are, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=48.16s)]
*  throughout the new administration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  We're going to keep pushing and try to get some clear legislation [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  passed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=55.8s)]
*  That's our next big goal in this administration, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=56.3s)]
*  to actually codify it in law so that it's permanent [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=58.42s)]
*  and it's not something that could flip back and forth [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  like a political football every few years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  How are you and others in the industry [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  thinking about your relationship with President Trump? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=68.3s)]
*  Well, we want to work with anybody who's in government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=72.06s)]
*  That's what we really tried to do in the Biden administration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=75.7s)]
*  I go to DC about once every quarter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=78.26s)]
*  We tried to get meetings. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  We really had a hard time getting meetings, frankly, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=81.26s)]
*  in the last administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=83.38s)]
*  In this administration, they seem [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  to be very willing to meet with us and at least have a dialogue. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=86.66s)]
*  Doesn't mean they're always going to do what we want. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  Just at least to be heard and understood [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=92.02s)]
*  is a good partnership between public and private sector. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=93.58s)]
*  So we're going to continue to try to invest [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=97.3s)]
*  in those relationships, just like we do with governments [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=99.3s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  Will you list President Trump's meme coin? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  So we've said publicly already that we do plan to list it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=105.62s)]
*  You shouldn't take any listing of a coin as an endorsement. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=110.22s)]
*  We try to have listing standards that are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=112.58s)]
*  a level playing field for all assets. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=115.9s)]
*  And then if you meet the listing standards, which [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  are around compliance and security, then it's up to the market [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  to decide what to trade. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=122.42s)]
*  So we're not registered investment advisors. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=123.42s)]
*  We just operate in exchange. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  So some people in the industry look at meme coins [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  and think that it's not serious, that you're [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=131.94s)]
*  trying to build a serious financial infrastructure [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  and make some serious changes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=139.9s)]
*  And you write a lot about economic freedom [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=141.38s)]
*  and sort of serious weighty topics. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=143.1s)]
*  And then there's, you know, peanut the squirrel [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=144.98s)]
*  and Pepe the frog and all kinds of stuff [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  that has a somewhat less serious bent to it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=150.26s)]
*  How do you think about it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=152.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, crypto is going to be many different things. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=154.62s)]
*  So you know, Bitcoin is the new gold standard. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=156.94s)]
*  It's a refuge from inflation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  It's a core primitive in this new financial system. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  And stable coins are making payments faster and cheaper, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  more global. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=166.42s)]
*  Now meme coins is another, just one of many areas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=167.82s)]
*  You know, there's NFTs and ICOs. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=169.98s)]
*  Like every few years, there's something really interesting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  happening in crypto. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=174.22s)]
*  And it's hard for me to, I agree. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=175.46s)]
*  I don't think all of it is very serious. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=176.94s)]
*  Nor does it have to be, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=178.98s)]
*  Things that are more like artwork or collectibles, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=180.34s)]
*  like baseball cards or things like that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=184.26s)]
*  I think that's fine if people want to put out art [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=185.66s)]
*  and have people collect it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=187.94s)]
*  I don't have any issue with that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=189.78s)]
*  And the other thing I would just say is like, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=191.26s)]
*  we always have to be a little cautious about judging. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=192.98s)]
*  You know, like a lot of innovation comes from play [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=196.66s)]
*  and experimentation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=199.1s)]
*  If you look at the early things people were building [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=200.34s)]
*  on the internet, it didn't look very serious. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=202.42s)]
*  You know, it was like animated GIFs and cat photos [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=204.54s)]
*  and silly things. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  And now 20% of all GDP is running on the internet [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=208.7s)]
*  of e-commerce, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  So I think that memes are actually kind of interesting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  Like they seem to be a very condensed form of information [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  that can go viral and messaging spreads through memes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  It's a way for people to poke fun at authority or ideas [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=222.94s)]
*  whose time has come. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=226.22s)]
*  And so I don't know exactly what will happen [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=228.17999999999998s)]
*  with meme coins. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=230.14s)]
*  I don't personally trade them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=231.61999999999998s)]
*  But I don't want to discount it too early [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=233.78s)]
*  if there's something that's percolating. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=237.1s)]
*  I mean, one difference obviously between meme coins [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=239.66s)]
*  and fun things on the internet in the past [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  is you couldn't lose a lot of money on fun things [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  on the internet in the past. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=246.06s)]
*  But you can on meme coins. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=247.7s)]
*  You might remember, you know, a lot of people got emails [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  about the Nigerian princes and, you know, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  there was a lot of fraud happening early internet as well [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=254.33999999999997s)]
*  as people learned and adapted to things. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=256.74s)]
*  But look, I don't want to minimize the issue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=258.46s)]
*  I think there are a lot of consumers [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=260.54s)]
*  that have been hurt in crypto. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=262.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, FTX blew up. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=263.38s)]
*  There's been, you know, ICOs that were scammy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=265.54s)]
*  So these things are something we're trying to really, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  you know, correct. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=270.86s)]
*  And the way you do it, I think, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=271.94s)]
*  is by getting clear regulation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  And that has to come from Congress. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=275.06s)]
*  Clearly the agencies are not really, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=278.1s)]
*  they don't have the motive to kind of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=280.42s)]
*  publish clear rules on their own. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=281.94s)]
*  And we want it to be in law. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  And then the regulators can go enforce the law. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  So we really, I think Coinbase has tried to be a good actor [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  to help clean up the industry, to do reasonable things, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=289.42s)]
*  even in the absence of clarity that we think might be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=292.18s)]
*  or should be required later. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=296.94s)]
*  The industry's had some bad actors [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  and we're trying to fix that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=299.42s)]
*  So let's dive into the regulatory stuff [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  because I find the regulatory stuff fun [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=303.26s)]
*  and I assume you do too. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=305.18s)]
*  I've come to enjoy it more over time actually. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  I didn't initially- [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=309.66s)]
*  You started as a technologist [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=310.5s)]
*  and then you become a regulationist. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I studied computer science. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=312.98s)]
*  I was really like a software engineer. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  I studied economics. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=315.54s)]
*  And when I first started Coinbase, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=316.54s)]
*  I naively sort of thought, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=318.78s)]
*  well, we just like follow the law [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=320.26s)]
*  and we get to build products for our customers [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  and then we don't have to ever worry about [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=323.05999999999995s)]
*  the government, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=324.73999999999995s)]
*  Turns out it's more nuanced than that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=326.26s)]
*  because anything sufficiently innovative [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  is eventually gonna bump up against government [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=329.58s)]
*  and you have to engage. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  So now we're just full, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=332.78s)]
*  I mean, we've completely reversed this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  in the last three years and we have, I think, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=335.7s)]
*  the best policy team out there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=337.78s)]
*  And we built a whole grassroots movement [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=339.14s)]
*  or helped it get off the ground with StandWithCrypto.org [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=342.05999999999995s)]
*  that had 2 million advocates in this recent election. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=344.58s)]
*  We had, this Fair Shake was a super PAC [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=346.74s)]
*  that I think had more, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=350.42s)]
*  I think it was like the highest bipartisan PAC [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=351.62s)]
*  dollar amounts in the last election. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=354.66s)]
*  So we've fully embraced this policy effort [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  as we kind of got beat up on the playground [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=359.06s)]
*  the last four years. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=361.38s)]
*  So what are the, I mean, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=362.42s)]
*  there are a bunch of things that are on the table [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=365.98s)]
*  There's FIT21, sort of how do you think about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=366.82s)]
*  the security commodity question [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=369.1s)]
*  that has bedeviled you guys for a while. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=371.94s)]
*  There's stable coin regulation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=374.54s)]
*  There's a wide range of things. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=376.1s)]
*  What are, if you had to sit, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=377.86s)]
*  if you, as you list your legislative [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=379.3s)]
*  and regulatory priorities, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=381.74s)]
*  like what's at the top of that list? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=383.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=385.14s)]
*  Well, I think you nailed a couple of them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=385.98s)]
*  So I think we do have a opportunity here [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  in the next six months to try to really [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=390.06s)]
*  get some legislation going. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=391.38s)]
*  For those of you who follow US politics [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=393.78s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=395.38s)]
*  we got a bill passed last year. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=396.9s)]
*  I wanna say we, I mean, the crypto industry, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=400.06s)]
*  the government itself, like everybody working together. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=402.5s)]
*  And it passed the House, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=406.7s)]
*  but it didn't get through the Senate. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=407.54s)]
*  And so now that we have a new Congress, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  you're kind of starting from square one. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=410.62s)]
*  The good news is that there's strong bipartisan support [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=413.1s)]
*  to get legislation passed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=415.3s)]
*  And the key principles that I think are coming together [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  are the ones you mentioned. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=420.06s)]
*  So the first one is what I would call token classification, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=420.94s)]
*  which is which of these are commodities, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  which are securities, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=425.54s)]
*  which are something else entirely like artwork, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=426.38s)]
*  which don't need to be regulated [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=429.42s)]
*  by either of those two other categories. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=430.5s)]
*  And getting the definitions of those are, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=433.46s)]
*  it's tricky and it's nuanced. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=436.09999999999997s)]
*  I've seen some draft language getting sent around. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=437.5s)]
*  You know, I'll give you like my high level way [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=440.02s)]
*  I think about it, which is a little different [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=442.02s)]
*  than how you might write it in law. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=443.94s)]
*  But if you're actually raising money for a company, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=444.94s)]
*  like you wanna make an apartment complex [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=448.34s)]
*  or a tech startup or a movie or something, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=450.14s)]
*  and you're a centralized group of people [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=452.26s)]
*  trying to build something in a world, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=455.34s)]
*  you're raising money from investors, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=456.62s)]
*  that should be, that is a security. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=458.09999999999997s)]
*  You should have to register it as a security. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=459.74s)]
*  There should be all the consumer protections [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=461.34s)]
*  that come with that, the disclosures. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=462.74s)]
*  And we've been actually petitioning the SEC for four years [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=464.58s)]
*  to try to make a pathway for that to happen, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=466.98s)]
*  but they were not willing to do it until hopefully now. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=468.5s)]
*  Now, once something becomes sufficiently decentralized, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=473.1s)]
*  I think it can become a commodity. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=476.24s)]
*  And the reason is that there's no, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=478.1s)]
*  like Bitcoin for instance, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=481.22s)]
*  there's no central group that is in control. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=482.22s)]
*  And you don't have this information asymmetry [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  between the people using it and the people building it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=486.54s)]
*  It's truly decentralized. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=489.74s)]
*  So I think there could actually be a decentralization test [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=491.54s)]
*  that would allow something to be a commodity [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=494.22s)]
*  and not a security. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=495.94s)]
*  And there could be different prongs to that test. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=497.26000000000005s)]
*  And then artwork would be another category, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=499.98s)]
*  stable coins would be another category. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=502.36s)]
*  So these are the core components of a bill. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=503.54s)]
*  So you really need a, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=506.18s)]
*  you're essentially proposing a remaking [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=507.74s)]
*  of the kind of standard classification [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=512.0s)]
*  which goes back to 100 year, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=514.22s)]
*  almost 100 years of security commodity. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=516.38s)]
*  You're opening up some new forms of tradable assets. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=519.34s)]
*  Is that how you, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=523.1s)]
*  you really need a big legislative overhauls, were you? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=524.58s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's an overhaul. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=527.5400000000001s)]
*  I'd say it's not gonna replace, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=528.82s)]
*  there's like the 1934 act [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=531.46s)]
*  that kind of created a lot of the securities law. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=533.02s)]
*  It would build upon that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  So I think it preserves that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=536.82s)]
*  And then it's really this new thing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=539.02s)]
*  which wasn't contemplated in the law previously. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=540.7s)]
*  Cause the securities law in the US was written [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=542.58s)]
*  because of orange groves and things. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=544.86s)]
*  And people were like, are the oranges, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=546.74s)]
*  the oranges are a commodity, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=549.82s)]
*  but if you make an investment contract to buy them, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=550.66s)]
*  that's a security. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  So these 1934, like the internet didn't exist, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=553.38s)]
*  So we're in this world now where, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=557.9s)]
*  now you can raise money for something [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=559.58s)]
*  and then it can actually decentralize over time. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  And it needs to have a pathway [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=564.74s)]
*  to convert from one to the other. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=565.82s)]
*  This is what a new bill I think would clarify in the law. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=567.82s)]
*  So you would be roughly suggesting [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  that sort of primary listings, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=573.5s)]
*  like a primary public offering of something [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=574.9s)]
*  where you're raising money, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=577.86s)]
*  that should have more regulation [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=578.78s)]
*  than secondary market trading of stuff [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=580.82s)]
*  that has already been offered. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=583.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'd agree with that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=585.0s)]
*  And that would, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=586.38s)]
*  who, how would you want those decisions to be made [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  about what in the secondary market trading [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=593.74s)]
*  sits over here as a security, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=596.46s)]
*  over there as a commodity, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=598.54s)]
*  over there as artwork? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=599.38s)]
*  Is that stuff that has to be determined in advance [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=600.22s)]
*  or is it something that the courts will assess? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=603.1s)]
*  Well, okay, so you're getting into the edge of my knowledge. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  We're deep into regulation details. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=610.38s)]
*  There was some reason. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  We'll pull out of this in a second, don't worry. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=613.26s)]
*  I'm gonna have to bring in the lawyers here in a second. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=616.14s)]
*  No, no, please, let's not, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=618.38s)]
*  with all apologies, we're not gonna do that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=619.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there actually were some court cases, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=621.0600000000001s)]
*  federal judges in the US ruled [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=624.78s)]
*  that the secondary transactions were permissible, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=626.22s)]
*  they were not securities. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=630.02s)]
*  I think there could be a pathway to do that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=631.0600000000001s)]
*  But you're getting kind of to the edge [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=632.62s)]
*  of my legal knowledge here. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  Let's jump to stablecoins, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=635.98s)]
*  which is the other thing that is a big priority [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=637.0600000000001s)]
*  of the industry and I'm sure of you as well, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=639.5s)]
*  to have some legislation that establishes [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=641.82s)]
*  what is the structure, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  the regulatory structure for a stablecoin, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=647.22s)]
*  which in a lot of ways looks like a money market fund, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=648.7s)]
*  looks like a bank product, but isn't quite. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=651.62s)]
*  And so some regulatory framework around that, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=654.4200000000001s)]
*  I think is central to the industry [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=657.22s)]
*  because stablecoins act as settlement currencies, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=658.74s)]
*  they act as payment currencies. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=661.98s)]
*  One of the issues is that the major stablecoin, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=665.1s)]
*  the largest one on your platform, Tether, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=668.02s)]
*  we've reported that they've had, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  they're facing inquiries by the Department of Justice, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=673.26s)]
*  they've been a number of questions about transparency, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=675.66s)]
*  custody of assets and other things. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=678.42s)]
*  Can you build a new digital asset infrastructure [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=680.5s)]
*  on top of something like Tether? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=683.62s)]
*  Well, the stablecoin that we prefer is actually USDC. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=686.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=690.86s)]
*  And we have a great partnership with Circle, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=691.98s)]
*  the issuer of that coin. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=693.74s)]
*  Tether has been very successful, I'd say, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=696.34s)]
*  in more like emerging markets [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=698.58s)]
*  and USDC has been more successful in developed markets [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=700.14s)]
*  and I think it's taking a, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=703.78s)]
*  it's hitting a higher bar of compliance. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=704.94s)]
*  Some of the things that might end up being prongs [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=708.74s)]
*  in this US legislation around stablecoin would be, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=710.86s)]
*  it needs to be 100% backed by US treasuries. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=714.26s)]
*  And if you have some of it in treasuries, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=719.26s)]
*  you have some of it in Bitcoin [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=722.66s)]
*  and some of it in corporate paper, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=723.74s)]
*  that's more like a hedge fund, that's not a stablecoin. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=725.22s)]
*  So I think you'll see 100% reserve requirement potentially, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=728.14s)]
*  pass an audit periodically, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=732.62s)]
*  have some sort of, you probably would need to create it [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=735.74s)]
*  in like a state trust or a bank could issue it, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=738.38s)]
*  but it doesn't have to be a bank [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=741.46s)]
*  because you're not doing fractional reserve. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=742.66s)]
*  So there's components like that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=744.46s)]
*  that would show up in a stablecoin law [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=745.98s)]
*  and I think it's actually imperative for the US dollar [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=747.34s)]
*  to maintain its reserve currency to try to digitize it [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=751.6600000000001s)]
*  and have it be adopted in more places around the world. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=754.6600000000001s)]
*  Of course, we want crypto to be adopted by everybody, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=757.4200000000001s)]
*  but from a US perspective, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=760.7s)]
*  when we speak with government there, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=762.1400000000001s)]
*  they are quite concerned about the digital R&B in China [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=764.26s)]
*  and they've started to advance that into other countries [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=767.6600000000001s)]
*  and start to have it used in more places. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=771.9000000000001s)]
*  So I think crypto is going to help the dollar [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=773.62s)]
*  as a stablecoin digitizing it, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=778.62s)]
*  it's also gonna help the dollar [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=780.06s)]
*  by having a check and balance [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=781.26s)]
*  on inflationary spending and deficits [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=782.3s)]
*  by having Bitcoin be an asset [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=784.78s)]
*  that's provably scarce people can flee to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=786.78s)]
*  in times of uncertainty, which is kind of another thought. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=788.4599999999999s)]
*  So you recently delisted Tether in Europe [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=791.26s)]
*  to comply with MECA, the European regulation [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  that sits atop digital assets over there [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=798.6199999999999s)]
*  to anticipate something similar in the US [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=801.26s)]
*  that the direction of travel in the legislation [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=803.06s)]
*  is such that Tether doesn't comply [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=805.7399999999999s)]
*  with what either the legislation requires [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=808.74s)]
*  or what you think is appropriate. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=813.3s)]
*  Yeah, so if legislation in the US was passed [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=815.42s)]
*  and Tether couldn't come into compliance, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=818.22s)]
*  I mean, we'd probably have to delist it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=819.86s)]
*  There is a reason why we would want to continue [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=822.66s)]
*  to support it though, which is just that [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=825.46s)]
*  there are a lot of people with Tether [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=826.86s)]
*  and we want to give them an off ramp. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=828.1s)]
*  If we want to help them transition [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=831.22s)]
*  to a system that we think is more secure, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=833.02s)]
*  I have nothing negative really to say about Tether. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=836.6600000000001s)]
*  I think they've been incredibly successful [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=839.2600000000001s)]
*  and different approaches can work [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=840.58s)]
*  in different countries around the world. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=842.1400000000001s)]
*  So I actually think they've been doing great. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=843.46s)]
*  But for people who do want to switch, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=845.38s)]
*  there should be an easy off ramp or on ramp, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=847.3000000000001s)]
*  And so that's partly why we'd like [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  to continue to support it for some time. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=851.98s)]
*  But if the US legislation blocks that, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=853.5400000000001s)]
*  then we'd have to delist it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=855.4200000000001s)]
*  Do you think that there's adequate KYC [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=856.3000000000001s)]
*  and controls around Tether for anti-money laundering, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=858.62s)]
*  sanctions violation, that sort of stuff? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=861.58s)]
*  That I unfortunately don't have enough information. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=863.94s)]
*  I mean, you'd have to ask them that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=866.74s)]
*  I've seen, I've read some of your reporting on it [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  and our journals reporting and others, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=869.3399999999999s)]
*  but I honestly don't know. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=871.06s)]
*  I want to change topics almost entirely. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=873.98s)]
*  Great, let's talk about something more cheerful. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=876.22s)]
*  Well, I want to talk a little bit about culture. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=878.86s)]
*  First, actually, we talk about corporate culture [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=881.38s)]
*  in a second, but I want to talk about America. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=882.9399999999999s)]
*  And we'll start with America, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  but we'll talk about the rest of the world also. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=888.74s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that what we saw [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=891.86s)]
*  in the US election was not just a kind of policy preference [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=894.86s)]
*  or of voters deciding that they preferred [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=901.02s)]
*  this set of crypto asset regulation [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=903.82s)]
*  to this set of crypto asset regulation. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=906.66s)]
*  It was a cultural moment and fit in [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=908.26s)]
*  with other cultural moments that were happening [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  in the United States, or happening in the United States [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=912.98s)]
*  right now. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=915.3000000000001s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=916.12s)]
*  and how you see crypto's place [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=916.96s)]
*  in the sort of cultural firmament at this moment? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=919.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think there was a shift broadly [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=922.22s)]
*  toward freedom, right? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=925.38s)]
*  And so that was freedom of speech. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=926.58s)]
*  It was also economic freedom. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=929.86s)]
*  People wanted the ability to store their own wealth [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=932.3s)]
*  in a way that couldn't be taken from them [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=935.68s)]
*  or they couldn't get debanked or deplatformed [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=937.94s)]
*  in the crypto space. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=940.3s)]
*  I think that it was a desire for smaller government [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=943.82s)]
*  and to make government more efficient. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=946.7s)]
*  They felt like there was 400 or 500 different departments [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=949.82s)]
*  and somehow they were adding one or two of them every year [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=952.7s)]
*  and nobody even knew how many of these things there were. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=956.26s)]
*  And I think people had this sense that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=958.82s)]
*  the government is just not very efficient [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=961.0600000000001s)]
*  at actually operating or building anything. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=962.98s)]
*  The role of government should actually be limited to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=966.1s)]
*  setting policy and let the private market [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=971.82s)]
*  implement a lot of these solutions. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=973.82s)]
*  Or Milton Friedman kind of classically said [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=975.1s)]
*  there should really only be three functions of government. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=977.5400000000001s)]
*  So it's have a military to defend from foreign invasions, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=979.58s)]
*  have a police force to help enforce contracts at home [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=984.14s)]
*  and then have a court system like a Department of Justice. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=987.34s)]
*  And so what are the other 400 plus departments doing? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=990.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's a little bit of what we saw with President Millet [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=994.5s)]
*  in Argentina, which I think has helped [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=996.98s)]
*  turn their economy around. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=999.22s)]
*  And it's not an accident that President Millet [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1000.9000000000001s)]
*  was probably at the inauguration. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1002.58s)]
*  And the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1005.6600000000001s)]
*  is taking inspiration from that in other areas. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1007.38s)]
*  So I'd say the US made a big shift toward economic freedom. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1009.74s)]
*  And to me that's actually what has made America strong. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1013.82s)]
*  By the way, the mission of Coinbase [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1016.7s)]
*  is to increase economic freedom in the world. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1017.7s)]
*  It's part of what I've been here at Davos [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1019.86s)]
*  talking to people about. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1021.38s)]
*  I think that's what has made America strong [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1022.9s)]
*  is a higher degree of economic freedom [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1024.94s)]
*  where people can go try crazy ideas, right? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1028.5s)]
*  And if you get too many regulations, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1030.7s)]
*  they can really kill innovation. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1033.9s)]
*  The lowest economic freedom countries, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1037.1s)]
*  the poorest people in the world are the worst off. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1039.62s)]
*  The environment is the worst off. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1042.4599999999998s)]
*  So there's a lot of good research on economic freedom [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1044.2199999999998s)]
*  that indicates this is a foundational [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1047.5s)]
*  to having prosperity in society. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1049.4599999999998s)]
*  And that's what I think crypto can actually do [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1050.98s)]
*  is create economic freedom for countries all over the world. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1052.82s)]
*  Is there, if you think about crypto, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  the crypto voting block politically, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1059.62s)]
*  you have priorities as a company, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1062.26s)]
*  as a big leading company in the space. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1065.3000000000002s)]
*  But presumably most voters don't think about [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1070.0600000000002s)]
*  these sorts of regulatory policy questions. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1074.3400000000001s)]
*  What is your assessment of what most crypto voters want? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1076.5400000000002s)]
*  From crypto, I mean they want lots of things. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1081.42s)]
*  What are they looking for? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1083.46s)]
*  Yeah, well this grassroots movement, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1085.1000000000001s)]
*  I mentioned stanowizcrypto.org, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1086.5800000000002s)]
*  was able to get to about two million advocates. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1088.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think if you ask people why they raised their hand [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1090.74s)]
*  and said I want to elect pro crypto candidates, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1094.26s)]
*  I think they would say that they felt like [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1098.54s)]
*  their rights were being taken away. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1100.86s)]
*  That they wanted to use this new technology, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1103.54s)]
*  that they were being persecuted for it. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1106.78s)]
*  That people would say, well you should trust [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1110.26s)]
*  the traditional financial system. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1113.9s)]
*  But they were seeing banks periodically blow up. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1115.34s)]
*  Like Silicon Valley Bank, right? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1118.5s)]
*  Or in the great financial crisis. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1119.74s)]
*  Or Signature Bank. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1121.02s)]
*  Some of these people were actually getting debanked. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1122.82s)]
*  I don't know if you've tracked this, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1124.98s)]
*  people refer to it in the US as Operation Choke Point 2.0. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1126.54s)]
*  But due to pressure from the regulators [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1128.94s)]
*  and probably folks like Elizabeth Warren, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1132.3s)]
*  banks were actually deplatforming folks [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1135.5s)]
*  and companies using crypto in the US unlawfully. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1137.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean they weren't breaking any rules or laws. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1139.98s)]
*  It was a soft pressure that was applied to them [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1142.1000000000001s)]
*  that was essentially bypassing. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1143.94s)]
*  If you want to get a law passed, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1146.02s)]
*  you have to go through Congress. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1147.02s)]
*  That's what the Constitution requires. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1148.62s)]
*  You should not be able to go into some regulator [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1151.34s)]
*  and pressure them to de facto create a law [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1153.82s)]
*  and debank all these people. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1155.54s)]
*  And so there was real genuine anger [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1157.3799999999999s)]
*  and frustration at all of that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1159.86s)]
*  I think that Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1163.98s)]
*  played a big role in costing the Democrats the election. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1166.62s)]
*  Because there is no, there's no anti-crypto, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1168.78s)]
*  they were very anti-crypto. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1171.78s)]
*  And it's not like you're gonna get a bunch of votes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1172.8999999999999s)]
*  There's no anti-crypto. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1174.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1175.8600000000001s)]
*  Block, right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1176.7s)]
*  But there is a huge pro-crypto voting block. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1177.54s)]
*  That was proven in this last election. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1181.0600000000002s)]
*  I think, I mean I would imagine that the argument from, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1182.98s)]
*  not that I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1187.22s)]
*  but I imagine the argument on the other side of that is, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1188.98s)]
*  well the regulations exist for a reason [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1191.5s)]
*  and the United States has had banking regulations [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1193.46s)]
*  and securities regulations for 100 years [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1195.42s)]
*  because philosophically the country, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1197.6200000000001s)]
*  the government believes that individuals [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1200.66s)]
*  should be, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1204.3s)]
*  I wanna say restricted from, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1207.78s)]
*  but maybe restricted from is the right word, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1208.98s)]
*  restricted from making bad decisions with their own money. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1210.74s)]
*  And I imagine you would argue that no, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1213.82s)]
*  that restriction should be pretty minimal. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1216.74s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1218.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I would probably lean more libertarian on this [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1220.18s)]
*  because I think it can become, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1222.94s)]
*  I understand the intention of it, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1225.34s)]
*  but you have to judge these policies based on [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1226.86s)]
*  not their intention but their results. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1229.06s)]
*  Like look at the accredited investor laws in the US, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1231.8999999999999s)]
*  for instance. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1234.3799999999999s)]
*  So to invest in a private company or a security, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1235.22s)]
*  you have to be a credit investor, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1239.54s)]
*  which basically means that you're already wealthy. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1241.02s)]
*  You have a certain minimum amount of net worth. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1243.02s)]
*  This is, it's a regressive policy. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1245.82s)]
*  I mean it's really like saying the only way [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1248.94s)]
*  you can get rich off these things is if you're already rich. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1250.7s)]
*  It excludes the poorest people in society [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1254.1s)]
*  from some of these great investment opportunities. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1256.8999999999999s)]
*  Now there's also a lot of bad investment opportunities. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1259.5s)]
*  The whole point of investing is like there's risk [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1261.3s)]
*  and there's return and so anything with zero risk [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1264.3s)]
*  has a lower return, right? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1267.34s)]
*  These are kind of foundational principles. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1268.34s)]
*  So if you have a society where people believe, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1270.54s)]
*  well the government is getting rid of all the bad investments, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1273.18s)]
*  they're gonna be less diligent about looking at each [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1276.62s)]
*  investment that they might make. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1279.78s)]
*  So if you start to pare back the paternalistic society, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1281.46s)]
*  you'll sometimes have these moments where [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1285.14s)]
*  people get caught up in scams and things, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1287.58s)]
*  but it'll quickly normalize. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1288.98s)]
*  Like people learn very quickly about, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1290.7s)]
*  oh if I go to this restaurant it has bad service, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1294.5s)]
*  so I spend my money over here. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1297.02s)]
*  The best regulator sometimes is actually the free market [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1299.5s)]
*  because there's ruthless competition for these customers [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1302.14s)]
*  and you actually wanna have a very low barrier [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1306.82s)]
*  for new people to come in and try to offer a better product [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1308.42s)]
*  at a lower price, right? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1311.78s)]
*  I'm gonna take a question or two in a minute, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1313.18s)]
*  but I wanna ask, so think, put your thinking caps on, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1315.7s)]
*  take a question. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1318.42s)]
*  One hand is already up in the back there, very fast. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1320.46s)]
*  But I wanna ask you about corporate culture also [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1323.3000000000002s)]
*  because you, in 2020, you had a sort of internet famous [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1325.42s)]
*  moment of talking about the Coinbase corporate culture, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1332.74s)]
*  which in a lot of ways was I think ahead of what happened [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1336.5800000000002s)]
*  to in a bunch of other companies four years later, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1341.46s)]
*  and not to put words into your mouth, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1344.46s)]
*  but I think a lot of it was about how Coinbase [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1346.98s)]
*  has a mission and the mission of Coinbase is important [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1349.7s)]
*  and the other parts of your life you should live [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1352.18s)]
*  on your own and not have them be part of the office, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1355.82s)]
*  sort of bring your whole self to work [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1358.38s)]
*  versus not bring your whole self to work, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1359.6200000000001s)]
*  and you were very much on the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1360.98s)]
*  not bring your whole self to work side. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1362.22s)]
*  Bring your best self to work. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1364.02s)]
*  Bring your best self to work. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1364.8600000000001s)]
*  How do you feel about that now with four years distance? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1367.22s)]
*  I think we were prescient on that issue. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1371.78s)]
*  We took some arrows at the time, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1374.22s)]
*  but it was absolutely the right call [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1375.58s)]
*  and I think many other big tech companies [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1377.6599999999999s)]
*  have followed in that. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1380.1799999999998s)]
*  So I'm glad we did it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1382.34s)]
*  I think it was an important moment. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1385.3s)]
*  There was something really insidious happening really [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1386.4199999999998s)]
*  in society at that time where I think a lot of people [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1392.46s)]
*  who were joining companies, they didn't really see it [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1394.58s)]
*  as their job to help advance the mission of the company. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1397.62s)]
*  They saw it as their job to hold truth to power [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1400.3s)]
*  to come in and send demand letters to leadership. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1403.06s)]
*  There's a class of employee that are actually [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1406.9s)]
*  like professional union organizers essentially [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1410.58s)]
*  and they'll kind of like fake interview [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1413.42s)]
*  to try to get a job in the company [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1415.34s)]
*  and then start to organize it with the protections [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1416.6200000000001s)]
*  knowing that it's difficult to let them go at that point. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1420.6200000000001s)]
*  So you can't really build a successful company [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1423.5s)]
*  if you have a bunch of people in there [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1426.78s)]
*  with their own priorities and missions [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1427.78s)]
*  all going in separate directions. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1429.5s)]
*  You need to have clear alignment [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1430.6200000000001s)]
*  and everybody rowing in the same direction. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1432.5s)]
*  Do you feel that people at Coinbase need to have [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1433.8200000000002s)]
*  that kind of libertarian view that you're espousing [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1435.9s)]
*  to be successful at Coinbase? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1439.54s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1441.54s)]
*  Our mission is to increase economic freedom [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1442.66s)]
*  so I want people to be passionate about that [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1444.3000000000002s)]
*  but there's people on all sides of the political spectrum [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1446.14s)]
*  that are really excited about that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1448.8600000000001s)]
*  People on the left, it's truly a bipartisan issue. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1450.46s)]
*  The people on the left are really excited about it [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1453.42s)]
*  in terms of financial inclusion, banking the unbanked, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1455.14s)]
*  equality of access and opportunity, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1459.1000000000001s)]
*  lifting people out of poverty. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1461.58s)]
*  I think there's lots of people on the right [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1463.62s)]
*  that are excited about it just in terms of [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1465.3s)]
*  let's have more economic growth, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1467.82s)]
*  there's national security arguments why this is essential [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1469.86s)]
*  and then there's libertarians, there's everything. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1472.7s)]
*  So crypto is really for everyone [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1474.58s)]
*  but we do want people to be at least excited enough [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1478.74s)]
*  about the mission to come work on it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1480.58s)]
*  To sign up. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1482.3799999999999s)]
*  One thing, another thing that you wrote in that memo [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1483.22s)]
*  that made an impression on me at least [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1485.22s)]
*  was that you asked everybody to assume [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1488.5s)]
*  the best intent of their coworkers [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1492.62s)]
*  and that there was a, that I think you were perceiving [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1494.82s)]
*  that there was a rush to sort of demonize your coworkers [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1497.62s)]
*  based on what they said or how they thought [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1504.1s)]
*  and you were sort of calling for everybody [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1506.7s)]
*  to kind of like just, we're all on the same team together, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1508.58s)]
*  assume that the person with the oars next to you [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1513.14s)]
*  in the boat is also rowing. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1515.7s)]
*  What are some other sort of like tips [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1518.3000000000002s)]
*  for how you try to encourage that kind of culture [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1519.94s)]
*  in a workplace? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1522.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is like a very simple one [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1524.1000000000001s)]
*  but I've coached a lot of people on this [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1525.7s)]
*  and I think it's helped inside Coinbase which is, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1527.42s)]
*  you're working hard, people are doing lots [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1530.46s)]
*  of different things. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1531.98s)]
*  Written communication can often be misinterpreted. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1534.8600000000001s)]
*  So if you're using Slack or email or if someone's, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1538.38s)]
*  even if in your personal life if someone's texting you, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1542.0600000000002s)]
*  occasionally you get in this kind of thing back and forth [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1544.3000000000002s)]
*  or like, wait, no, that's not what I meant, like this [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1546.14s)]
*  and then you start to see like a little text thread. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1548.7s)]
*  Things to discuss over text are better, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1552.94s)]
*  they're like, hey, can you get this back to me [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1554.7800000000002s)]
*  by end of day, sure, those are good things. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1556.74s)]
*  The minute it gets into any kind of nuanced conversation, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1558.6200000000001s)]
*  like pick up the phone. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1560.9s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds simple but a lot of more junior people [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1562.5400000000002s)]
*  on the team, they don't know, it's okay if I call them, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1565.46s)]
*  like yes, pick up the phone. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1568.0600000000002s)]
*  Once you can hear the tone of someone's voice [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1570.38s)]
*  like a lot more, I mean the best is face to face [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1573.18s)]
*  and the next best is voice, the next best would be text [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1577.1s)]
*  and you just miss so much, somebody could write something [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1579.62s)]
*  in text like, oh, like nice job on that project [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1583.1399999999999s)]
*  and you think like, oh, they're dissing me [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1586.54s)]
*  or they're being sarcastic or something [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1588.2199999999998s)]
*  and I guess that's why you have to use a lot of emojis. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1589.86s)]
*  Can I, are we gonna go to questions? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1593.98s)]
*  Over in the back, you had your hand up first. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1595.4199999999998s)]
*  Just shout, oh no, we got a microphone coming. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1598.4199999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1601.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1604.1399999999999s)]
*  Hyder Manon, CEO of Big TXN from London. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1605.58s)]
*  Thank you for your thoughts. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1609.46s)]
*  We have a Herculean task ahead of us [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1610.86s)]
*  which is almost an inevitability, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1613.98s)]
*  the replacement of the traditional financial markets [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1616.1s)]
*  with digital asset infrastructure. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1618.86s)]
*  How do you see that happening [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1621.78s)]
*  and what timeline do you put to that? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1622.82s)]
*  You know, I don't really see it as a replacement. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1626.34s)]
*  I think it's pretty complimentary. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1628.6599999999999s)]
*  You may disagree on this, but for instance, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1631.62s)]
*  the Bitcoin ETFs came out recently in the US [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1633.54s)]
*  and it was hugely, a lot of Wall Street folks [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1636.58s)]
*  were kind of asking me, isn't this gonna be cannibalizing [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1639.94s)]
*  your trading revenue or something? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1642.02s)]
*  And it actually turned out to be the opposite. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1644.3799999999999s)]
*  Like $50 billion flowed into the Bitcoin ETFs. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1645.8999999999999s)]
*  The BlackRock one, I think was the largest [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1649.3s)]
*  in the first year which broke all the records [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1651.18s)]
*  and a bunch of money flowed. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1654.94s)]
*  Coinbase did better. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1657.34s)]
*  We saw increased trading volume and share. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1659.34s)]
*  By the way, and we also got, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1661.6599999999999s)]
*  we powered the custody underneath for BlackRock. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1663.3s)]
*  So it was entirely additive. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1665.62s)]
*  We want, you know, I really want crypto [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1668.06s)]
*  to update the financial system globally [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1670.26s)]
*  and that means it's gonna have to integrate [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1671.82s)]
*  with every traditional financial service firm. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1672.98s)]
*  Many of them are already doing it, by the way. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1675.1799999999998s)]
*  The card networks, the big banks, the fintech platforms, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1677.1399999999999s)]
*  you know, PayPal, Stripe, Cash App, Robinhood, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1682.3s)]
*  all have crypto integrated now. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1684.62s)]
*  This is good. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1686.78s)]
*  We want this to happen. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1687.62s)]
*  The only way we're gonna really update [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1688.86s)]
*  the financial system is to integrate with every company. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1689.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1692.62s)]
*  That partly answers my question. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1693.4599999999998s)]
*  The thing that I wanted to kind of focus on was, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1694.3s)]
*  yes, ETFs are fine in their place [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1696.74s)]
*  and, you know, there's only so much Bitcoin [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1699.34s)]
*  so there are only gonna be so many ETFs in the end. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1701.5s)]
*  However, I think what I was trying to say [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1703.6999999999998s)]
*  was structured products, for example. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1706.1s)]
*  Great example, right? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1707.34s)]
*  The issuance of structured products today [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1709.1799999999998s)]
*  is done primarily on mainstream exchanges. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1711.34s)]
*  When do you see that becoming like a digital thing? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1715.78s)]
*  When they're natively issued on digital exchanges? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1718.14s)]
*  With clear legislation, hopefully in the next few years. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1722.18s)]
*  One more question in the back. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1724.94s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1726.3400000000001s)]
*  Hi, my name is Alyssa Cohn. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1727.18s)]
*  I'm an executive coach so I'm curious, of course, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1728.18s)]
*  about the leadership aspect of when you made [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1730.14s)]
*  that very unpopular at the time decision. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1731.94s)]
*  Was it a decision you made by yourself [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1734.0600000000002s)]
*  or with your executive team? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1735.66s)]
*  And didn't you have some trepidation? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1736.9s)]
*  It was so counter-cultural at the time. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1738.66s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1740.18s)]
*  Yeah, I had a lot of trepidation. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1741.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it was very scary. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1744.94s)]
*  So at one point we had 300 employees walk out [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1746.94s)]
*  and I had never experienced that before [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1751.78s)]
*  and I was actually a little confused by it [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1753.46s)]
*  because many CEOs subsequently have talked about this. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1754.98s)]
*  They would do these open mics [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1757.98s)]
*  and it's actually a little dangerous [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1759.66s)]
*  to have an open mic at a large, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1762.46s)]
*  if you have 50, 100, maybe 500 people, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1764.46s)]
*  it starts to feel like, hey, we're all on the same team. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1767.18s)]
*  This might be something in human psychology, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1769.18s)]
*  like Dunbar's number, right? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1770.98s)]
*  You start to get thousands of people [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1772.5s)]
*  and these little factions will sometimes develop [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1774.42s)]
*  and you'll get people who play this game [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1777.06s)]
*  at the company town hall, which is like, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1778.66s)]
*  how much can we make the leadership team square [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1780.26s)]
*  and on stage, right? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1782.02s)]
*  And I noticed a lot of the questions we were getting [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1783.06s)]
*  were they weren't about our products or regulation [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1784.98s)]
*  or they were about societal issues [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1787.94s)]
*  like police brutality or something. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1790.5s)]
*  And so when employees did the walkout, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1792.54s)]
*  I was initially, I was like, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1795.58s)]
*  this company has nothing to do with police brutality. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1797.06s)]
*  Why are they walking out? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1798.82s)]
*  And we had everybody come back to the office [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1800.74s)]
*  but I didn't feel good about it. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1804.5s)]
*  Something felt wrong. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1805.58s)]
*  I was thinking, I've messed something up here. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1806.58s)]
*  Either this is now the job of a CEO in 2021 [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1810.54s)]
*  or whenever it was, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1814.86s)]
*  and frankly, I don't think it's very fun. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1816.06s)]
*  So either I need to leave [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1818.54s)]
*  or I need to change something in the company. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1820.3s)]
*  And I talked to a few people, my board and others, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1822.3s)]
*  and they were like, no, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1824.8999999999999s)]
*  if you think this is not what the company should be doing, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1826.62s)]
*  there's probably a bunch of other people [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1830.1799999999998s)]
*  who are afraid to speak up and they're silent [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1831.26s)]
*  and they need to go. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1833.26s)]
*  You don't need to go. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1835.94s)]
*  They need to go. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1837.14s)]
*  And so I started writing down a few drafts [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1837.98s)]
*  and that's where it helps me collect my thinking. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1840.74s)]
*  I remember I shared some of the drafts [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1843.9s)]
*  with some of our executives [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1845.62s)]
*  and some of them were like cautiously optimistic. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1847.86s)]
*  Some of them were like begging me not to post it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1850.7s)]
*  I met with some of our employee resource groups. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1854.1s)]
*  They seemed more cool with it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1856.94s)]
*  It was some of the activist folks inside the company, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1860.3s)]
*  they were telling me like, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1862.74s)]
*  underrepresented minorities will never work [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1863.9s)]
*  at this company again. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1865.66s)]
*  You're killing the company. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1867.02s)]
*  It was very extreme. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1868.98s)]
*  And when I met with the ERGs, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1870.98s)]
*  they didn't feel that way. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1872.86s)]
*  They were like, yeah, we actually wanna just focus on work [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1874.18s)]
*  and learn and develop in our careers. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1876.18s)]
*  So I had a sense that it would really piss off the world, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1878.14s)]
*  but it would actually probably only lose [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1883.94s)]
*  like five, 10% of the company [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1886.46s)]
*  and the remaining 90% would then be fully aligned [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1888.22s)]
*  and we could get back to working. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1890.74s)]
*  And so, yeah, I guess it was one of these [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1892.86s)]
*  like very contrarian calls. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1895.4199999999998s)]
*  I think within a few weeks, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1897.22s)]
*  like the New York Times wrote this article [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1899.62s)]
*  implying we were a racist company. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1901.1399999999999s)]
*  We got lots of attack pieces from journalists, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1904.34s)]
*  but ultimately I think it was one of the best things [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1908.9399999999998s)]
*  I ever did for the company. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1911.02s)]
*  It really, it clarified what we were all about, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1911.9399999999998s)]
*  but it also was like this incredible leadership moment, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1914.62s)]
*  which I didn't fully anticipate the impact of at the time. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1917.6599999999999s)]
*  So I think a little bit of autism helps sometimes [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1919.94s)]
*  and then a little bit of courage. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqVO6LDKBo&t=1924.38s)]
