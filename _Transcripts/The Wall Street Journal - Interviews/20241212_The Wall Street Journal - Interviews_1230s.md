# Janet Yellen on the Economy and Upcoming Trump Administration Policies  | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA)
*  Now let's see, I've known you for a very long time. I think I knew your first Washington job when you were chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=0.0s)]
*  You were also later chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. And now you're completing four years as the United States Treasury Secretary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=6.0s)]
*  I believe you're the only person to have held all three of those jobs. Am I right? Yeah. That is true. As far as I can tell there's only one significant economics job you have not held which is chair of the economics department at the University of California, Berkeley. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=15.0s)]
*  Why is that? I think it's a job that's a bit of an administrative nightmare. People tend to try to avoid it if possible. And so the only job you didn't have is the one you didn't want. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=28.0s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. So let's reflect just initially on your four years now. You're leaving at a time. Four years. The economy's been through a lot in the last four years. What in your view are the most enduring legacies of President Biden since your tenure with respect to the economy? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=43.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, when President Biden assumed office, we were in the midst of the pandemic. Thousands of people were dying every day and people were really suffering about to lose the roofs over their heads. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=62.0s)]
*  And we saw cars lined up in parking lots at food banks. People were really hurting. And we acted very quickly to alleviate the suffering the pandemic had caused and to support the economy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=77.0s)]
*  And the consequence was that we enjoyed the fastest and strongest recovery really of any advanced nation. According to the economist, the U.S. economy is the envy of the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=96.0s)]
*  And we have, if you compare us with the other G7 countries, you see the strongest growth, far stronger productivity growth than any other country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=113.0s)]
*  We've all experienced unwanted inflation due to the supply chain damage that was caused by the pandemic. But in the United States now versus pre-pandemic, a typical median worker in the United States now can buy the same basket of goods as before the pandemic with $1,600 left in the bank. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=132.0s)]
*  And that's not over to spare. So workers are getting ahead. It's been about the most equitable recovery that we have seen with gains widely shared, increases in wealth across the entire wealth distribution. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=162.0s)]
*  So the U.S. economy at this point is doing well. Inflation is now receded to close to the target. We've also focused on the medium and longer term performance of the economy enacting critical legislation and much of it, frankly, bipartisan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=179.0s)]
*  We've also focused on the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Chips and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, where we're for the first time in a long while seriously investing in a whole range of important parts of our economy from restoring our infrastructure to creating jobs in key sectors that will be important to our future. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=202.0s)]
*  Clean energy, semiconductors, and importantly, we're creating good jobs all across the country, but they're disproportionately going to places that have lacked opportunity. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=230.0s)]
*  75% roughly of the investment, the private investment that's been stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act is going to counties with below median income and education. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=244.0s)]
*  And so we're creating good jobs, especially for individuals who don't have or want to have a college education. And we're also making our economy more resilient by reducing our dependence on global markets. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=262.0s)]
*  And so over time, this should make our economy less subject to global shocks. At the same time, we've taken other important steps, rebuilding international alliances that had frayed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=283.0s)]
*  And so we're in a position to be able to work with our partners, trying to restore our contact with China, probably the most important bilateral relationship in the world. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=304.0s)]
*  We have important disagreements with China, and we need to be able to express those. But we also need to be able to collaborate and cooperate on other areas where we have shared concerns. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=319.0s)]
*  I think that bilateral relationship is on stronger footing. And we're beginning to address in an important way supply chain issues in areas we've become over dependent on China and need to broaden our supply chains. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=334.0s)]
*  And while we want to make sure that we have domestic capacity in some areas, the approach that we've been pursuing is not to try to do everything at home, but to continue to reap the benefits of global trade by pursuing a French shoring strategy in which we deepen our trade relations with other countries around the world that we feel we can depend on and become less concentrated. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=353.0s)]
*  Reliance on China. So those are some of the things we've taken steps to address the high cost of living that's been burdening families from well before the pandemic, bringing down health care costs, drug prices, energy costs through the investments that we're making. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=383.0s)]
*  Obviously, the election did not go the way you or President Biden were hoping. So now you'll be watching the incoming administration with their economic agenda from the sidelines. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=406.0s)]
*  You've seen some of the economic priorities President-elect Trump has laid out. In particular, he wants to make ample use of tariffs. He's talked about tariffs of 60 percent or more on China, 10 to 20 percent on the rest of the world. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=415.0s)]
*  He's already threatened 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada. As a Treasury Secretary and as an economist, what in your judgment will be the effect of this agenda if he carries it out? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=428.0s)]
*  Well, I think the imposition of broad-based tariffs, at least of the type that have been discussed, almost all economists agree that this would raise prices significantly for American consumers and create cost pressures on firms that rely on inputs that they acquire through import. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=439.0s)]
*  So it would have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of some sectors of the United States economy and could significantly raise costs to households. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=468.0s)]
*  So this is a strategy I worry could derail the progress that we've made on inflation and have adverse consequences on growth. That said, our administration also believes that sometimes the use of tariffs is appropriate. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=481.0s)]
*  And we've used them in cases where we feel there are unfair trade practices. I've complained frequently and talked to our allies about Chinese practices of developing over capacity, which end up dumping essentially goods into global markets that can undermine sectors of the United States where we want to be able to do that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=501.0s)]
*  So I think we want to have an important role in the future. In fact, as we spoke about earlier, I remember something you said a few years ago. You said that when you were trained as an economist, you were told that when somebody sends you cheap goods, you send them a thank you note. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=531.0s)]
*  But you don't think that any longer. In what ways have yours and in fact the world at largest assumptions about the advantages of free trade, especially with a country like China, evolved or changed in recent years? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=545.0s)]
*  So let me start with the thank you note. So the reason that I was trained to think about sending a thank you note is that having the ability to import goods that other countries have a comparative advantage in producing can significantly lower costs for domestic consumers and businesses and enable a country to deploy its own resources into a global market. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=558.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And I think that's a very important point. And [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=588.0s)]
*  And in the same as a couple of minutes ago when research filed with the U.S. conscious mind unit and WTO we saw when research filed with the WTO we saw [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=618.0s)]
*  an absolute DIY challenge of low [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=622.8s)]
*  an absolute diligent of low cost imports into the United States [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=624.24s)]
*  cost imports into the United States [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=625.0s)]
*  cost imports into the United States [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=626.28s)]
*  cost imports into the United States particularly in in manufacturing [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=627.28s)]
*  particularly in in manufacturing [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=629.64s)]
*  particularly in in manufacturing [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=630.78s)]
*  and in sectors that provided very good [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=632.8s)]
*  and in sectors that provided very good [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=633.9s)]
*  jobs for people without a college [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=634.66s)]
*  jobs for people without a college [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=636.58s)]
*  education and it's estimated that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=640.9s)]
*  education and it's estimated that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=642.84s)]
* ayan good jobs were were [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=646.0s)]
*  were really heavily affected adversely by this rush of imports. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=648.0s)]
*  So trade isn't, it can have adverse consequences, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=656.2s)]
*  distributional consequences that are very important. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=660.82s)]
*  And we've become much more aware of those [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=664.72s)]
*  that trade may not lift all boats. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=668.0s)]
*  It may lift some and actually lower others. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=670.8s)]
*  And also when we allow subsidies in foreign countries [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=675.4s)]
*  that undermine our competitiveness in areas [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  that are critical like semiconductors where we used [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=686.52s)]
*  to manufacture a very large share of the world's semiconductors [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=690.84s)]
*  and largely due to subsidies in other countries lost [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=696.36s)]
*  that capacity that can have very adverse long-term consequences [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=700.4s)]
*  in a sector where technological change often emanates [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  from the process of production. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=714.16s)]
*  So there can be long-term losses from allowing foreign practices [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=716.44s)]
*  that undermine our competitiveness [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=722.76s)]
*  in these industries. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=725.44s)]
*  And so during the Biden administration, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  we have imposed targeted tariffs on clean energy, goods, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=731.36s)]
*  and semiconductors from China. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=737.4s)]
*  Now this affects only $18 billion of trade, but these are sectors [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=740.16s)]
*  that we've decided are critical to our future. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=745.5999999999999s)]
*  Another, you talked about the fight to get inflation back down. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=748.64s)]
*  We've almost got to 2% the Fed's target. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  We're not quite there yet. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=754.52s)]
*  One of the principal philosophies of the administration was [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=755.88s)]
*  that you would leave the Fed alone to do this job. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=758.72s)]
*  President-elect Trump has talked about how he thinks he should be able [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=761.08s)]
*  to give advice to the Fed. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=763.88s)]
*  He said how he thinks that if he told Powell to quit, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  Powell could and should quit. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=768.76s)]
*  What is your opinion of the President-elect Trump's inputs [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=770.4s)]
*  on the Fed this way and what would your advice, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=775.2s)]
*  and if Powell were asked to quit, what would you suggest he do? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=777.64s)]
*  So let me say I've spent a good share of my life [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=781.5999999999999s)]
*  in various positions in the Fed, and I'm a strong proponent [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=784.92s)]
*  of an independent and nonpartisan, nonpolitical Fed. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=789.8s)]
*  It has a committee that is appointed with Senate approval of people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=796.4s)]
*  who bring, come from a variety of backgrounds, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=805.2399999999999s)]
*  bringing different expertise and skills, and it makes policy in a way [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  that I have never in all the years I've been affiliated [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=816.56s)]
*  with the Fed see politics come into play. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  And what research has shown, and this is certainly what I see [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=823.8s)]
*  from my own experience, is that countries perform better. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=828.68s)]
*  They have not only better inflation performance [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=833.9599999999999s)]
*  since every central bank has a price stability mandate, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=837.4s)]
*  but real performance in terms of job creation [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=841.6s)]
*  and growth is also stronger when a central bank is left [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=845.52s)]
*  to use its best judgment without political influence. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=851.08s)]
*  So what will the effect be if Trump gets his way and is able to, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=855.08s)]
*  like, interfere with the Fed or push out the chairman, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=858.64s)]
*  or do you think that he actually cannot do that? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=861.52s)]
*  Well, I believe the chairman can, my understanding is, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=863.64s)]
*  can only be removed by the Senate for cause. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=867.36s)]
*  So the chairman has a four-year term, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=871.12s)]
*  and I don't believe can be removed. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, a president is free to comment on policy. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=878.8s)]
*  Generally, in the administrations that I've been part of, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=886.76s)]
*  the White House and president have refrained from doing that, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=891.56s)]
*  and the Fed itself has become much more communicative over time, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=897.64s)]
*  informing the public about the logic of its policies [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=903.28s)]
*  and providing forward guidance [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=907.2399999999999s)]
*  so that markets understand what the considerations are [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=909.9599999999999s)]
*  that go into Fed policy. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=914.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think this has led to very good economic performance, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=916.88s)]
*  and it keeps the Fed out of politics, which I believe is important [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  so that the Fed is seen as an agency that is doing its very best [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=926.24s)]
*  to pursue American welfare, broadly speaking. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=933.0s)]
*  So I think it's a mistake to become involved in commenting on the Fed [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=937.64s)]
*  and certainly taking steps to compromise its independence, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=943.3199999999999s)]
*  and I believe it tends to undermine the confidence [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=947.88s)]
*  of financial markets and ultimately of Americans [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=952.8399999999999s)]
*  in important institutions. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=956.12s)]
*  Have you, President Trump has nominated or picked Scott Besant, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=959.4s)]
*  a hedge fund manager, to be your successor as Treasury Secretary. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=964.16s)]
*  Have you had a chance to speak with Mr. Besant and Besant [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=968.64s)]
*  and what are your impressions? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=972.4s)]
*  And do you have any advice for him? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=974.28s)]
*  Well, I did have one conversation with him before Thanksgiving, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  and I congratulated on him on his nomination and told him [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=981.8000000000001s)]
*  that I thought he would find this an extremely interesting [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=988.44s)]
*  and challenging job and that the Treasury has a very broad range [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=992.84s)]
*  of responsibilities, not only for economic policy broadly, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=998.52s)]
*  but for tax policy, for sanctions policy, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1003.6s)]
*  for international alliances and a broad range, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1007.6s)]
*  and that what he would find at Treasury is a staff [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1012.72s)]
*  and particularly civil servants who are analytical, proficient, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1017.16s)]
*  professional, operate with high integrity and produce analysis [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1024.92s)]
*  that can be relied on that is important [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1031.48s)]
*  to financial markets and to the economy. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1036.92s)]
*  The Treasury market is perhaps the most critical global financial [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  market and the Treasury produces analysis and policy [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1047.72s)]
*  that helps the economy function better [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1054.44s)]
*  and is important to financial markets. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1057.88s)]
*  One question, one last question. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1060.8000000000002s)]
*  One not so great aspect of the legacy you and President Biden [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1063.0800000000002s)]
*  leave behind is a very large budget deficit, roughly 6% of GDP. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1066.2800000000002s)]
*  Are you sorry you couldn't make more progress on that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  and how much of a risk does that pose to the economy? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1071.88s)]
*  Well, I am concerned about fiscal sustainability [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1074.6000000000001s)]
*  and I am sorry that we haven't made more progress. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1078.88s)]
*  I believe that the deficit needs to be brought down, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1083.28s)]
*  especially now that we're in an environment [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1087.6s)]
*  of higher interest rates. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1090.48s)]
*  And for example, over the last year, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1092.32s)]
*  the interest cost of the debt is increased by several hundred billion. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1095.2s)]
*  It's one of the largest items responsible for the increase [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1100.28s)]
*  in the budget deficit. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1106.2s)]
*  And we do need to bring it down, the primary deficit, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1108.6s)]
*  excluding interest, is now a little over 3% [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1113.16s)]
*  and I believe it needs to come down. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1117.48s)]
*  President Biden signed when we raised the debt ceiling last [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  an agreement that has led to a trillion dollars [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  in deficit reduction over the next 10 years. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1130.28s)]
*  But he proposed a budget for 2025 that includes another 3 trillion [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1136.2s)]
*  in deficit reduction over the next 10 years. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1142.96s)]
*  And that plus allowing the expiration of parts of the tax, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1147.3600000000001s)]
*  JCTA, the Tax Cut Act of 2017 to expire was sufficient [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1158.2s)]
*  to keep our fiscal policy on a sustainable course. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1165.04s)]
*  But there will be important negotiations over what happens [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1171.24s)]
*  with those expiring tax provisions. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1176.28s)]
*  If everything is kept in place and they're not allowed to expire, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1180.68s)]
*  we just keep JCTA as it is today. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1184.88s)]
*  CBO has estimated that the cost of that is $5 trillion. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1189.72s)]
*  So I believe it's important. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1195.04s)]
*  I hope that Congress in considering this will look for ways [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1197.28s)]
*  to pay for whatever they do extend to avoid that explosion [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1202.56s)]
*  of our deficit from the starting point [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1208.44s)]
*  where the deficit is already too high [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1211.2s)]
*  and that they'll focus any relief on middle class families [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1213.72s)]
*  and look for ways to raise revenue and pay [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1221.24s)]
*  for anything that's put in place. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1224.52s)]
*  Well. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCeY2CoLxyA&t=1227.2s)]
