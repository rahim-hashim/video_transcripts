# Jonathan Haidt on the Mental-Health Crisis and Smartphones | WSJ News
**The Wall Street Journal - Interviews:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc)
*  But let's just start, let's assume that like maybe 10% [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=0.0s)]
*  of the people in the room don't know your thesis already. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=4.0s)]
*  What is your thesis in your latest book? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=6.5s)]
*  So what we know for sure is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=10.76s)]
*  that mental health statistics were pretty stable [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=12.84s)]
*  from the late 90s to about 2010, 2011. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=15.32s)]
*  Actually getting even a little better. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=18.04s)]
*  And you mean mental health among young people? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=19.64s)]
*  I mean among teenage, American teenagers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=21.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden around 2012, 2013, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=23.96s)]
*  measures of depression, anxiety, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=27.96s)]
*  and self-harm go skyrocketing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=29.520000000000003s)]
*  It's like a hockey stick, especially for girls. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=31.12s)]
*  So what caused that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=33.2s)]
*  And we didn't know for a long time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=34.68s)]
*  There's a lot of debate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=36.2s)]
*  But once you see that that happened at the same time [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=37.52s)]
*  in the same way in Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  much of the Nordic countries, much of Northern Europe, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=43.72s)]
*  now the number of hypotheses about what could cause this, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=46.72s)]
*  basically maybe somebody dropped some weird chemical [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=50.2s)]
*  on those countries in 2012 and that's what happened. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=52.56s)]
*  Or maybe it's because we had the great rewiring of childhood [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=55.32s)]
*  where everyone traded their flip phones in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=58.52s)]
*  In 2010 they had flip phones. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  They used those as tools to meet up with other kids. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=61.88s)]
*  By 2015 they have a smartphone with high speed internet, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=64.68s)]
*  social media, Instagram in particular, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=67.92s)]
*  front-facing camera, and now a lot [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=70.32s)]
*  of kids are spending five to ten hours a day doing this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=72.56s)]
*  which blocks out everything else. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=76.56s)]
*  So my argument is not just about the phones. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=78.64s)]
*  My argument is that we used to have a play-based childhood [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=80.28s)]
*  for the last 50 million years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  That's what mammals do. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=86.04s)]
*  They play. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=87.34s)]
*  Young mammals must play a lot. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=88.64s)]
*  If you've ever had a puppy, you know that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=89.94s)]
*  But we took our children in the 90s and said no more of that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  No more outside play. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=93.8s)]
*  You have to be supervised all the time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  So the loss of the play-based childhood set them up for kind [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=96.4s)]
*  of a weakness and fragility. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=98.92s)]
*  And then the arrival of the phone-based childhood [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=100.64s)]
*  between 2010 and 2015. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  That's the story I put forth in the book. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  And I'm having wonderful debates [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=106.56s)]
*  with a few research psychologists who say [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=107.88s)]
*  that I don't have the evidence and they say my focusing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=110.16s)]
*  on this is hiding the real causes of the epidemic, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=114.44s)]
*  but they won't say what those are because they don't know. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=116.72s)]
*  Right. Well, that was going to be my next question, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=119.44s)]
*  I mean, I think absent even all the scientific evidence [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=121.6s)]
*  that you cite, it's universal in my experience [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=125.36s)]
*  that parents are very concerned about, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=129.12s)]
*  overuse of devices by their kids. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, there are folks who say, oh wait, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=134.88s)]
*  isn't this a modern-day moral panic like comic books [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=139.28s)]
*  in the 1950s, like violent video games in the 1990s? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=142.76s)]
*  And your answer has been no, this time it really is different. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=148.4s)]
*  And so how is it different than those previous? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=151.76s)]
*  Yeah. So the idea that this is just a groundless moral panic, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=154.2s)]
*  the kids are all right, we've been through this before, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=157.56s)]
*  you know, in the 18th century it was novels, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=160.6s)]
*  we're going to excite young women's sexual passions, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=162.72s)]
*  we must ban novels. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=165.06s)]
*  So perfectly reasonable hypothesis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=166.8s)]
*  I'm glad that people were skeptical back [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=168.44s)]
*  in 2019 when I started this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=170.76s)]
*  But this is so different in so many ways. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=173.24s)]
*  One is that previous moral panics were spread [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=175.52s)]
*  by the media, stories about a kid who saw something [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=179.6s)]
*  or read a comic book and then axe murdered his mother. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=183.08s)]
*  It probably never happened, but the media runs with it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=185.88s)]
*  This time around, everyone has seen it in their own children [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=189.24s)]
*  or their friends' children or their nieces and nephews. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=193.4s)]
*  Everyone knows someone who's been harmed by social media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=195.96s)]
*  Everyone knows a girl who is cutting herself out of anxiety. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=198.88s)]
*  So this is very different from any previous moral panic in that way. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=203.36s)]
*  Another way is that in previous moral, in this time around, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=206.72s)]
*  you talk to members of Gen Z, the older ones, you talk to members [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=210.44s)]
*  of Gen Z who are 18 or especially those in their 20s and you say, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=214.2s)]
*  so do you think the phone based childhood is good? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=218.08s)]
*  Do you think it's beneficial? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=220.28s)]
*  I can't find anyone who says yes to that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=221.58s)]
*  I can't find anyone. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=223.16s)]
*  There's universal agreement, it seems, among Gen Z [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=224.8s)]
*  that this has really messed them up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=227.62s)]
*  And then you say, I say to my students, well, why don't you get off? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=229.94000000000003s)]
*  And they say, we can't because everyone else is on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=233.02s)]
*  So it's a trap, whereas comic books and things like that, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  they weren't a trap in that way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=240.3s)]
*  And the young people weren't saying, please, comic book makers, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=241.9s)]
*  stop making comic books that are so addictive, we can't put them down. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  Like, that didn't happen, but it's happening now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=248.46s)]
*  There are a lot of youth-led organizations that are advocating [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=250.78s)]
*  for major changes because this is messing up the generation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=253.06s)]
*  Great. So to sum up, I mean, this sounds like the precautionary principle, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=256.12s)]
*  Like social science is hard. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=260.96s)]
*  It's hard to definitively demonstrate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=262.6s)]
*  There's no earth, too, where these phones don't exist and we can play it out that way. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=264.32s)]
*  But part of what you're saying is based on anecdotal evidence, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=269.12s)]
*  based on the balance of the scientific evidence as you interpret it, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=272.92s)]
*  why would we take this risk or why are we taking this risk? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=277.52s)]
*  Right. So I'm glad you mentioned the precautionary principle. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=280.0s)]
*  So there are two different ways of thinking about risk and the risk [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=282.72s)]
*  of making a mistake or a false diagnosis. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  So the psychologists that are debating with me, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=289.68s)]
*  and it's a good normal academic debate, they're in the mindset [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  of reviewing for a scientific journal. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=295.72s)]
*  And when we review for an article for a journal, our attitude is, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=298.44000000000005s)]
*  it's got to be, you know, p less than 0.05, multiple experiments. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=302.44000000000005s)]
*  We have to be really certain that this is right because we don't want [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  to publish something that's wrong. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=308.36s)]
*  So it takes a lot of proof before we'll say, okay, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  this is certain enough that we're going to let it in. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=312.8s)]
*  It's like in a jury trial for a criminal case, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=315.04s)]
*  it has to be beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=317.6s)]
*  That's fine for a jury trial. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  That's fine for a scientific journal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=321.24s)]
*  If our kids are cutting themselves and killing themselves [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=323.92s)]
*  at much higher levels than they did before, are we going to say, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=326.48s)]
*  let's not do anything until we're certain. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=329.72s)]
*  Let's be totally certain before we do anything. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=332.24s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, the things that we're supposed to, that we should do, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  they cost nothing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=337.0s)]
*  There's bipartisan agreement that we should do them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=338.52s)]
*  There's no risk. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  So my argument is, okay, I think the evidence, and actually, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  there's a lot of experimental evidence as well of causation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=345.88s)]
*  I think the evidence is pretty clear. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=348.52s)]
*  We can debate whether it's certain or not certain. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=350.2s)]
*  But when you look at the risk benefit ratio, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  why the hell aren't we acting? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=354.9s)]
*  Right. And I mean, I think this is kind of like the strong [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=357.64s)]
*  and the weak case for what you're arguing for, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=360.35999999999996s)]
*  which is ending the so-called phone-based childhood, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  Even if someone is not convinced by trends in mental health among teens [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=366.36s)]
*  or they think that that's, you know, it does vary by country, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=373.56s)]
*  there's just the simple fact that it obviously is trading off with, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=377.56s)]
*  you know, the play-based childhood. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=382.04s)]
*  And, you know, even if these were just little TVs they were carrying [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=384.24s)]
*  around, we would want to limit their time on that because it's going [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=387.52s)]
*  to trade off with everything else in their life. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=390.36s)]
*  However, it is affecting their mental health. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=392.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  So let me just lay out. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=396.7s)]
*  So there's a lot of ideas in the book for what parents can do. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=399.12s)]
*  I have a whole chapter on what parents can do with dozens of ideas, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=402.44s)]
*  what teachers can, schools can do, what governments can do, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=405.32s)]
*  what tech companies can do. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=407.8s)]
*  But the key to the whole thing is understanding the collective [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=409.36s)]
*  action problem, that the reason that we're pressured [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=412.24s)]
*  to give our kid a phone is that she says, mom, everyone else has one. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=414.72s)]
*  I'm being left out. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=417.88s)]
*  I'm being made fun of. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=419.18s)]
*  So we all say, okay, here's a phone. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=420.48s)]
*  It's the collective pressure that got us so deep into this, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  even though most of us can see that this is really bad for our kids. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=425.44s)]
*  But it's collective action that will get us out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=429.16s)]
*  And so what I tried to do at the end [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=431.08s)]
*  of the book is propose four simple norms. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=432.38s)]
*  I tried to make it really clear and simple. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=434.52s)]
*  Four simple norms. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=436.6s)]
*  If we do these things we roll back the phone-based childhood. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=437.88s)]
*  One, no smartphone before 14. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=440.48s)]
*  You can give them a flip phone, you send them out, give them a phone [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  so you can, flip phones so you can text them, they can text you, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=446.56s)]
*  call if they need to. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=449.58s)]
*  But you do not give a child the internet in their pocket [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=450.92s)]
*  where strangers can reach them and they can watch beheading videos. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=454.76s)]
*  You don't give that to a child to have with them all the time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=457.92s)]
*  That's the same as for an iPad. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=461.28s)]
*  You don't have one of those devices until you're 14 minimum. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=462.58s)]
*  That should be the minimum national norm. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=465.52s)]
*  That's one. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=467.8s)]
*  Number two, no social media until 16. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=469.64s)]
*  The internet is not social media. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=472.44s)]
*  The internet is wonderful. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=474.12s)]
*  The internet is amazing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=475.44s)]
*  So some bad stuff, but man, the benefits of the internet are vast. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  Nobody wants to get rid of the internet. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=480.38s)]
*  Social media is not the internet. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=482.14s)]
*  You take a vote on social media, let's just do it right now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=483.94s)]
*  How many of you raised your hand here in this room if you wished [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  to God that the internet was never invented? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=489.58s)]
*  You wish we could have, raise your hand high. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=491.7s)]
*  Okay, nobody. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=494.5s)]
*  Okay, now what about TikTok and Instagram? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  Do you, raise your hand if you wish it was never invented. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=498.09999999999997s)]
*  Okay, and that's a lot of the room. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=500.73999999999995s)]
*  So the kids say this themselves. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=503.64s)]
*  18-year-olds say this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=505.46s)]
*  They wish that this didn't exist, but they're stuck, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=506.73999999999995s)]
*  they're trapped on it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=509.22s)]
*  So how about we just delay it until 16. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  Just don't let children go through puberty on social media. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=512.94s)]
*  That's the really vulnerable time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=516.5s)]
*  Third norm, phone free schools. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=518.26s)]
*  Imagine for those of you who went [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=520.62s)]
*  to school before the internet, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=522.6600000000001s)]
*  imagine that the school had a new rule. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  You can bring in your television from home. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  You can bring in your walkie talkies. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=529.58s)]
*  You can bring in your record player, put it all on your desk, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=531.62s)]
*  we'll give you an outlet, and you can do [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=534.38s)]
*  that during class while the teacher's talking. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=535.98s)]
*  This is complete insanity, but that's what we've done. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  That's what we've done. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=540.26s)]
*  Any school that lets kids have the phone in their pocket, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=541.56s)]
*  you know, my kids went to New York City public schools, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=544.06s)]
*  and the rule is you can't take out your phone during class, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=546.14s)]
*  which means that you have to hide it behind a book [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=548.5s)]
*  or under your desk if you want to text and watch video [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=550.66s)]
*  and watch porn, which the kids do. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=553.38s)]
*  So what we've done is completely insane, and guess what? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=555.5s)]
*  Academic achievement has been going down, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=559.54s)]
*  not since COVID, but since 2012. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=561.8s)]
*  As soon as the kids all had the internet in their pocket, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=564.78s)]
*  they can't resist. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=567.88s)]
*  They have to be using it since everyone else is using it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=569.18s)]
*  And so academic achievement, our kids are learning less, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=571.84s)]
*  the teachers are quitting. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=574.4s)]
*  There's just a great article in the journal about a teacher [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=575.6999999999999s)]
*  who just couldn't stand it anymore from the phones. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=577.0s)]
*  So the third norm is phone-free schools. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  And the fourth norm is the hardest, actually, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=581.56s)]
*  because we have to overcome our own fears. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=584.06s)]
*  The fourth norm is far more independence, free play, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=586.12s)]
*  and responsibility in the real world, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=590.0s)]
*  just like everyone had until the 1990s. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=592.12s)]
*  Kids must learn to be self-governing, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=596.24s)]
*  and the way they learn that is by being self-governing, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=598.92s)]
*  by being out with a group of friends. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=601.36s)]
*  They get into trouble, they get out of trouble. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=603.02s)]
*  They get in a conflict, they get out of the conflict. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=604.64s)]
*  There can't be an adult guarding them all the time [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=606.84s)]
*  until they go to college. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=610.0s)]
*  So those four norms, we roll back the phone-based childhood. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=611.76s)]
*  They're not that hard. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=614.8s)]
*  So let's. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=616.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=617.6s)]
*  Let's talk about the future now. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=618.9s)]
*  Okay. And the future of everything. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=624.2s)]
*  Yeah, the future of everything, including human beings. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  And so Gen Z, the oldest members of Gen Z are 28 now. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=629.48s)]
*  They have already had a phone-based childhood. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=634.76s)]
*  They're kind of the first generation to have [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  that for the totality of their growing up almost. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  What are the implications of this generation who's had [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=644.48s)]
*  that experience, you know, growing older and starting [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=647.4s)]
*  to kind of cross all these life milestones [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=651.4s)]
*  and getting jobs and everything else? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=653.88s)]
*  Right. So one hypothesis that people had a number of years ago, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=655.2s)]
*  back when I wrote The Coddling of the American Mind, was, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=658.6s)]
*  ah, they'll grow out of it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=660.76s)]
*  You know, this behavior they're doing in college. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=662.2s)]
*  Oh, they can't do that when they go to Goldman Sachs. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=664.2s)]
*  They can't do that when they go to Google. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, that wasn't true. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  The norms of universities have been brought [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=669.24s)]
*  into the corporate world. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=670.64s)]
*  Now that Gen Z is 28, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=672.24s)]
*  and the main characteristic is much greater anxiety [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  and more fragility. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=676.44s)]
*  Employers, I talk to a lot, I work in a business school. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  I talk to a lot of people, people in the corporate world. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=680.44s)]
*  People are finding it very hard [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=684.0s)]
*  to incorporate their Gen Z students, their Gen Z employees. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=685.0s)]
*  They're lovely people, they're smart, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=689.52s)]
*  but they've had a lot going against them. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=691.3199999999999s)]
*  And then they came out during COVID for whatever reason. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=694.4s)]
*  It's just hard, it's just much harder to incorporate them. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=696.52s)]
*  I think what we're seeing is a lot less innovation. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=699.16s)]
*  There's a conversation between Sam Altman and Pat Collison, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=703.2399999999999s)]
*  where they pointed out that for the first time since the 60s [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  or 70s, there's not a single dominant, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=710.72s)]
*  there's not a major figure in Silicon Valley under 30. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  That's never been true before. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=717.08s)]
*  What I'm seeing in my students [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  and what we're seeing around the country is [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=720.12s)]
*  that because we all have limited attention, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=722.08s)]
*  but because young people have given all of their attention [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  to their devices, five hours a day [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=728.24s)]
*  of social media is the average, the average in this country. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  It's mostly video, it's mostly TikTok [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=734.76s)]
*  and YouTube shorts, things like that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=736.2s)]
*  So five hours a day just for that, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=738.44s)]
*  and then another five to seven hours for other things. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=740.24s)]
*  They have no attention to actually do anything. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=742.72s)]
*  So that might be why they're not innovating as much. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, I don't have hard data on that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=749.08s)]
*  Please. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=750.8s)]
*  I got to push back on the idea that every member [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=752.12s)]
*  of Generation Z is a screen-obsessed zombie. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=753.28s)]
*  Not every member. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=755.88s)]
*  I'm a social scientist. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=757.2s)]
*  I don't mean every member. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=758.48s)]
*  I mean averages. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=759.8s)]
*  Right, okay, so on average. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=761.08s)]
*  But in my experience, they're also the ones leading the charge [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=762.4s)]
*  to detach from social media, to not post, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=766.4s)]
*  to be digital minimalists. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=770.88s)]
*  I mean in one of your most recent newsletters, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=772.72s)]
*  you said there are all these youth organizations. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=774.72s)]
*  So it does feel like there is sort of a counter movement coming [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=777.4s)]
*  from members of Gen Z themselves. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=781.28s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=782.96s)]
*  Well, they certainly are activists in the online world, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=784.28s)]
*  and they're using the online world to push back [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=787.08s)]
*  against the online world, which is fine. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=789.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=791.2s)]
*  These are powerful tools. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=792.52s)]
*  I'm happy they're doing that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  So yes, Gen Z, this is almost uniformly the case. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=795.16s)]
*  Gen Z does not support the phone-based childhood. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=799.88s)]
*  They're opposed to it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=802.48s)]
*  They see the problems with it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=803.8s)]
*  And now finally, in the last three or four years, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=805.12s)]
*  we're seeing a bunch of older Gen Z, although some started [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=807.0s)]
*  in college, forming organizations to push back. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm really encouraged. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=812.08s)]
*  I'm trying to help them. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=813.36s)]
*  We're all connecting up. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=814.68s)]
*  This is becoming a global movement. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=815.96s)]
*  But how successful have they been so far? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=818.08s)]
*  It's very hard leading these voluntary movements [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=821.8s)]
*  because it's still a trap. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=823.76s)]
*  I do think that the best thing that we could do, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=825.84s)]
*  the most important thing that would help us here, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=827.96s)]
*  is age verification, which the companies really, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  really don't want to do. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=832.68s)]
*  And Chris and I were backstage during the previous session. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=834.08s)]
*  We only caught part of it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=837.4s)]
*  But I come here to the Wall Street Journal, and I learned [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=838.72s)]
*  that the only ethical social media company [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  in the world is OnlyFans. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=843.0s)]
*  That was pretty interesting. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  Because they seem to actually take seriously that children [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=846.64s)]
*  should not be on their platforms, whereas the view at Meta [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=849.64s)]
*  and TikTok is, oh, yeah, you know, 13 is the minimum age, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  but they'll do everything they can to get young children. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=856.8s)]
*  You know, Meta even had something like, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=858.7199999999999s)]
*  how do we get three and four-year-olds? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=860.1999999999999s)]
*  How do we get into play dates? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=861.3599999999999s)]
*  So we desperately need help from government [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=862.7199999999999s)]
*  to force the companies to age gate. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  But beyond that, I think we can do most of it with norms [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=869.56s)]
*  that we do within communities, within groups of families, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  and with schools. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=876.92s)]
*  Can't we just convince Tim Cook to take over age gating? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he did it with ads. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=881.2s)]
*  So yes, that would really help. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=883.08s)]
*  In the book, I do propose sort of a, so ideally, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=885.12s)]
*  there'd be like age gating, like in order to go into a casino [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  or a bar or a strip club or a brothel, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=893.72s)]
*  you have to show some identification and show [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=896.24s)]
*  that you're at least 18 or 21, depending on the case. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=899.6s)]
*  I think social media should be the same as that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  But that does raise possible privacy issues. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=904.36s)]
*  And if people have to show a driver's license [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=907.76s)]
*  or face recognition in order to watch Pornhub, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=909.48s)]
*  I understand a lot of people aren't going to like that. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=911.72s)]
*  So a halfway measure is to say, well, can't you at least help the parents [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=914.0s)]
*  who don't want their kids on Pornhub? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=921.6s)]
*  Can't you do anything for us? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  And the answer is, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=926.2s)]
*  You could make phones that are marked in hardware or software [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=927.8800000000001s)]
*  as this is a child's phone or this is a kid with a particular birthday. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  And so then when that child tries, and it would be the same [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=935.6s)]
*  on their computer and on their iPad, everything, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=938.48s)]
*  so when that child tries to go to Pornhub, all Pornhub has to do is just, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=940.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, send down a signal. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=944.6s)]
*  There's a check. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  Is this a hardware device that we can deal with? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=947.2s)]
*  So this causes zero privacy concerns. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  The rest of the world can still go on Pornhub and do whatever they want. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=951.7600000000001s)]
*  But at least if I want to keep my own children off of TikTok and Pornhub [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  and Instagram, and I do deliberately put the three together, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=960.12s)]
*  then Apple could really help us do that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=964.88s)]
*  And what about kind of, I mean, we're quickly moving toward a world, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=968.48s)]
*  this was my last panel with the Mozilla folks, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=972.72s)]
*  where everything you just described from social media to the browser [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=974.56s)]
*  and the internet at large is getting usurped by AI as a dominant mode [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=979.36s)]
*  of interacting with our devices. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we just saw that with the open AI demo and then the controversy [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=986.16s)]
*  about Scarlett Johansson. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=989.28s)]
*  What do you think is going to be, you know, if that's been the impact [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=990.64s)]
*  of social media, what do you think is going to be the impact [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=993.04s)]
*  of this universal access to AI? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=994.96s)]
*  Yeah. So AI, so I'm a social psychologist. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=996.92s)]
*  I'm extremely alarmed about the state of American democracy. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1002.2s)]
*  We've lost a lot of the assumptions that the founding fathers had. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1005.28s)]
*  We're in big trouble in terms of the structure and stability [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1008.64s)]
*  of our institutions and our democracy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1013.08s)]
*  I believe that AI is going to bring in very quickly an era [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1015.32s)]
*  of extraordinary prosperity economically and of sociological chaos [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1018.6800000000001s)]
*  with a risk of collapse because we're already in a hell of a state. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1023.84s)]
*  And now anyone who wants to flood the zone with incredibly vivid movies [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1028.48s)]
*  of anyone saying anything, they can do that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1032.4s)]
*  You mean like deep fakes? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1034.88s)]
*  Deep, yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1036.2s)]
*  Deep fakes can do that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1037.48s)]
*  From looking at teen mental health, the problem, you know, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1038.8s)]
*  as I say in the book, for girls, social media is particularly toxic [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1041.24s)]
*  and a lot of them get addicted to social media, more so than the boys. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1044.76s)]
*  For the boys, it's that they're withdrawing from the real world [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1047.6s)]
*  because the real world is hard. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1050.28s)]
*  School is harder for them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1052.12s)]
*  They don't get recess and play and shop anymore. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  They have to sit in their chair all day long. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1055.44s)]
*  Boys are withdrawing from the real world. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1057.44s)]
*  This is Richard Reeves' work. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1058.72s)]
*  I think he's actually here today. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1060.04s)]
*  Richard Reeves is here. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1061.32s)]
*  Yeah. And just as they were withdrawing, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  the virtual world got more and more amazing. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1065.04s)]
*  So the video games get more and more amazing. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1067.1599999999999s)]
*  The porn gets more and more amazing. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1068.72s)]
*  Well, what's coming up is that every lonely boy, the boys are so lonely. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1070.6799999999998s)]
*  They don't spend much time with other human beings. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1074.44s)]
*  So the boys are so lonely. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1076.64s)]
*  The girls are too, but it's really hitting the boys even more. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1077.72s)]
*  Well, now they're going to have AI girlfriends. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1080.64s)]
*  People are already falling in love with AI. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1083.16s)]
*  If you're flirting with someone and she's brilliant and she's witty [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1085.4s)]
*  and you can program her personality so that she's just what you want, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1088.8400000000001s)]
*  you're going to fall madly in love. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1092.16s)]
*  And so this is what, if we don't, we have to accept the principle now [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1093.8000000000002s)]
*  that technologies that we allow adults to use are often not appropriate [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1098.3200000000002s)]
*  for children. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1102.48s)]
*  And so if we can't get age-gating now on social media, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1103.8000000000002s)]
*  it's game over for the boys. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1105.68s)]
*  The boys are going to be lost in amazing AI worlds of video games, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1107.2800000000002s)]
*  pornography, friends. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1111.48s)]
*  And then how are they going to turn into a man who is able to flirt [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1113.2800000000002s)]
*  with a real woman for heterosexual couples, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1118.2s)]
*  flirt with a real woman, court someone, fall in love, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  get married, stay married, have children. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1124.2s)]
*  So girls are becoming much more depressed and anxious. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  Boys are being blocked in their development. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1130.44s)]
*  They're not turning into men. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1132.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be so much worse when they have lots of AI friends [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  and servants. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1136.44s)]
*  How many servants do you want your children to have? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  If you have a 12-year-old son, do you want him to have a maid? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1139.64s)]
*  Do you want him to have a chauffeur? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1142.24s)]
*  Do you want a private tutor? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1143.2s)]
*  Would you like your child to have 15 servants? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1144.3600000000001s)]
*  That would be so warping, but that's what's coming. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1146.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, the private tutor sounds appealing if they'll help them learn [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1148.92s)]
*  their mathematics. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1151.68s)]
*  I know we're going to, I know we're out of time, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1153.2s)]
*  but I know that definitely there's going to be some questions. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1154.68s)]
*  So do we have any mic runners? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1157.72s)]
*  And maybe we'll have one or two questions. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  Please keep them very short because somebody's going to start staring [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1163.9599999999998s)]
*  daggers at me. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  We have some questions over here, some raised hands. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1168.9599999999998s)]
*  Is there any, excuse me, you mentioned TikTok and Instagram [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1174.56s)]
*  and Pornhub as three social media sites. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1177.4399999999998s)]
*  Are there any for children? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1183.12s)]
*  I guess maybe what are the elements of those [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1184.32s)]
*  that you think are really bad when you think about there [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1186.28s)]
*  are certain social media sites made for children. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1189.36s)]
*  I have a nine-year-old daughter, a six-year-old daughter, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1191.96s)]
*  and they do seem to interact with their friends on those in a healthy way. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1193.8s)]
*  But I don't know, maybe they're bad too, and I got a bad parent. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1197.28s)]
*  So two things. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1200.68s)]
*  First, social media is not the internet. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1201.28s)]
*  When the internet came out, people could find each other. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1203.6s)]
*  They could find information. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1206.0s)]
*  LGBTQ kids could find information. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1207.44s)]
*  They could find each other. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1209.68s)]
*  So the internet's amazing. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1210.44s)]
*  Social media is, these are companies that have taken over our children's [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1211.92s)]
*  childhood, invited them in, created a whole world [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1215.3999999999999s)]
*  with no immune system, as we saw before, no safety by design. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1218.28s)]
*  Safety is an afterthought. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1221.6s)]
*  So I think that social media is just entirely inappropriate for children. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1223.6s)]
*  What is appropriate for children? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1226.56s)]
*  Stories. Stories are great. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1228.08s)]
*  Human beings tell stories. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1230.24s)]
*  We live in stories. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1232.12s)]
*  We've always told stories around the campfire. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1233.2s)]
*  So if kids are going to watch a little bit of television, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  a story that's at least 20 minutes long, that's great. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1238.44s)]
*  Now, they shouldn't be watching six hours a day, but watching a movie, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1241.6399999999999s)]
*  watching a story is okay. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  TikTok is not stories. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1248.28s)]
*  TikTok is lots of little garbage things that are degrading, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1249.8s)]
*  and at the end of four hours, my students say, I spent four hours, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1252.72s)]
*  and I don't know what I saw or what I learned or what I did. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1256.88s)]
*  It just was four hours down the drain. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1259.48s)]
*  So I don't think there's any way to either give kids lots [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1261.44s)]
*  of short videos and have that be good for them, or put them in contact [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1266.2s)]
*  with strangers on an unverified platform, some of whom want to see photos [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1269.2s)]
*  of them in their underwear. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1272.92s)]
*  Like, why are we doing this? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1274.58s)]
*  There's no way to make that safe. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1276.52s)]
*  So, I think it's a good idea to do that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1278.28s)]
*  But I think it's a good idea to do it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1280.08s)]
*  So, I think it's a good idea to do it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1281.48s)]
*  So, I think it's a good idea to do it. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1282.88s)]
*  So, I think it's a good idea to do it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NfPHrVilc&t=1284.28s)]
