# Elon Musk’s Twitter venture would be declaring war on the regime: Revolver News journalist
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs)
*  Darren Beatty has thought a lot about what Elon Musk should do to save this nation's public discourse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=0.0s)]
*  He edits Revolver.News and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Darren, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=6.24s)]
*  What do you think Elon Musk will do? What should he do? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=10.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think he needs to understand exactly what he's getting into. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=14.56s)]
*  He's stepping into the war zone in a way that he might not even be able to imagine at this point. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=19.68s)]
*  As you point out, the entire regime depends on holding a total monopoly over what [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  Elon rightly calls the global public square. Anyone who threatens that steps into territory that is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=34.8s)]
*  not a normal financial realm. Twitter is not a normal company. The question of who controls [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=42.32s)]
*  Twitter is far more consequential than say who controls Home Depot, even though Home Depot [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=50.72s)]
*  is vastly larger as a company. And so Elon needs to be prepared for what's coming. It would be one [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=56.72s)]
*  of the few things that is not fake and not performative. It would amount to effectively [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=64.16s)]
*  a declaration of war on our corrupt and illegitimate regime. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=70.4s)]
*  He must understand that. I mean, I don't know Elon Musk, but he sees a lot of things coming [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=76.0s)]
*  that the rest of us don't. So he must know what he's playing with here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=81.76s)]
*  Well, I would hope so. But I think it's very easy to underestimate the stakes here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  The stakes of who controls the global public square are vastly more than the meager [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=97.36s)]
*  30 billion dollars that Twitter is allegedly worth. The stakes of who controls the global [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=104.8s)]
*  public square is more important even than an electric car company. And in fact, I would say [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=111.12s)]
*  winning the political battle in the West is more is just as relevant to the future of human [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=118.72s)]
*  civilization than even space travel, because after all, we're bringing our memes to space. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=126.8s)]
*  Well, I agree with that completely. So why wouldn't, just to sum up, why not democratize it? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=133.44s)]
*  Why wouldn't Musk say to the American public, if you're on board, join me in buying shares of this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=138.16s)]
*  publicly traded company, pledge me your proxy votes, and let's take it over and restore free speech? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=144.72s)]
*  I think that's a splendid idea. I imagine there are a variety of mechanisms, but it all catches [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=152.64s)]
*  out to this, a declaration of war on the regime. And I really hope that Elon will go ahead with it, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=158.72s)]
*  that he's not just another rich guy, that he's someone who wants to be a great man. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=165.84s)]
*  And this is one of the few real steps that he can make. And he's one of the very few live players [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=170.48s)]
*  on this earth who's in a position to do it. I don't think you're overstating the stakes at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Darren Beaty, thank you for joining us. Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThdBWh6shs&t=181.6s)]
