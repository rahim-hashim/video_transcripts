# Saudi Arabia considers ditching the dollar for Chinese oil sales
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE)
*  How thoroughly has the Biden administration mismanaged American leadership around the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=0.0s)]
*  world? Well, here's one very significant indicator. The Saudi kingdom, Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=4.4s)]
*  reportedly considering accepting Chinese currency instead of U.S. dollars for its oil sales to China. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=9.52s)]
*  This would be a huge change. For almost 50 years, Saudi Arabia has traded oil exclusively in U.S. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=16.4s)]
*  dollars, and that has been a massive boon to the United States. According to the Wall Street [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=22.8s)]
*  Journal, which broke the story, the Chinese government is, quote, offering everything you [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=27.04s)]
*  could possibly imagine to the Saudis. What would this mean for the United States? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=30.64s)]
*  Elbridge Colby is a former Pentagon official. He's also a principal at the Marathon Initiative. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us tonight. Bridge, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=42.0s)]
*  So we didn't want to let the story pass. I think it's being ignored by a lot of people. It seemed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  like a major story to us, is it? Yeah, I think so, Tucker, and I think you're right [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=50.16s)]
*  to point to the dollar's role as central to our well-being in a very practical level. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=57.12s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing is early indications of a movement towards probably two blocks, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  one led by us and one led by China, and that's going to have massive implications, especially if [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=67.44s)]
*  we're poorly organized. And I think the point that you're making, Tucker, which is absolutely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=72.16s)]
*  right, is we need to be jealously and carefully thinking about this kind of crown jewel of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=75.52s)]
*  role of the dollar and just being very careful in how we use it. And I mean, the Saudis are a great [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=80.56s)]
*  example of poor foresight and strategic planning. The administration was very tough on the Saudis, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=85.2s)]
*  and yes, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an abomination. But on the other hand, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  if you're going to end up needing them and asking them for help, maybe you should have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=95.2s)]
*  think about how you approached them in the first place. And this is not the only example of that, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=97.92s)]
*  where we need to take strategic account of the consequences and not be solely focused on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=102.48s)]
*  moral posturing, if you will. And that's a classic example. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  And because otherwise, we're not going to be thinking about what's in the long term interest [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  of the American people. I mean, it feels like they're college sophomores. Like all they're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=116.96s)]
*  capable of is a moral lecture. And I'm not against moralizing. We do it all the time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  There are moral questions to solve. But if you're leading a country, shouldn't you put its interest [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  at the top of your concerns? They don't seem to be. Absolutely. I think you do. And I mean, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  I think you take proper account of the ways in which you're going to pursue sort of high [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=137.04s)]
*  minded goals and then you stick to them. But if you're going to make a huge moral issue and then [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=142.64s)]
*  back off it when you need it, well, that's going to result in a situation which the Saudis and the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=146.55999999999997s)]
*  Emiratis don't return your phone call. And that's not a good situation. That's not serving anybody's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=150.0s)]
*  interest, not serving a moral interest. And it's not serving Americans interests. That's exactly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=153.44s)]
*  right. We are a force for good in the world because we're rich, okay? Because we can afford to be. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=157.44s)]
*  Burundi is not. Not because they're not good people, because they're not rich like we are. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=162.56s)]
*  So if we jeopardize our affluence, we jeopardize our ability to make the world better, obviously. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  Bridge Colby, I wish you were running the State Department. Thank you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Dougher. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onB09SS1dE&t=175.84s)]
