# Glenn Greenwald reacts to White House on Spotify's stance on Joe Rogan
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc)
*  If you don't watch the White House press briefings with Jen Psaki, and we sympathize with you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=0.0s)]
*  if you don't, you may have missed us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=6.72s)]
*  We played it before because it was really one of the amazing moments in American politics. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=8.36s)]
*  None of people noticed it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=12.72s)]
*  Jen Psaki from the podium in the White House briefing room the other day called on Joe [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Rogan's boss, Spotify, to censor Joe Rogan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=18.78s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=24.68s)]
*  This disclaimer, it's a positive step, but we want every platform to continue doing more [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=26.58s)]
*  to call out mis- and disinformation while also uplifting accurate information. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  But ultimately, you know, our view is it's a good step, it's a positive step, but there's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=36.7s)]
*  more that can be done. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=42.42s)]
*  So what the apologists have told us for the past four years, as we've pointed out, censorship [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  after censorship after censorship, book burning, it's all totally fine because the government's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=48.82s)]
*  not doing it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=53.12s)]
*  For five years, as long as it's not the government, then really, says David French, the First [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=55.12s)]
*  Amendment doesn't apply. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  But here you have the government, the president's own spokes chick, demanding censorship, and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=61.82s)]
*  then the company obeying. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=67.82s)]
*  Spotify has removed 70 episodes of Joe Rogan's show. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=69.38s)]
*  So this seems like a crime, actually, but what do we know? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=73.08s)]
*  We're not lawyers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=77.02s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=78.02s)]
*  He's also an independent journalist. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=79.02s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=80.02s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=81.02s)]
*  So they've been telling us all this time, like, it's no big deal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=82.74s)]
*  Settle down, Glenn Greenwald. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  This is not a violation of the First Amendment, whatever it is. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  This looks like a violation of the First Amendment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=90.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=92.74s)]
*  And obviously, that that comment that you just referenced is in and of itself disturbing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=93.74s)]
*  Why should the White House be weighing in at all on who they think should be on Spotify, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  who they think should not be, what they think Spotify should and shouldn't be doing about [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=104.66s)]
*  their podcast host? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=108.84s)]
*  But it's even more alarming when you consider that it's actually part of a broad pattern, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=111.56s)]
*  even an explicit strategy by Democrats to use their majoritarian power in Washington [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  to coerce companies to censor for them in ways the Constitution would prohibit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=121.76s)]
*  They've repeatedly subpoenaed social media companies and explicitly said, if you don't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=126.86s)]
*  start censoring more, you will face legal and regulatory reprisals. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=131.22s)]
*  Remember, when Parler was taken off the Internet, when it was the number one most popular downloaded [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=135.7s)]
*  it was because AOC went online the day before and said, hey, Google and Apple and Wall Street [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=141.58s)]
*  and Amazon, why are you allowing this app that I don't like on the Internet? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=146.34s)]
*  And three days later, it was gone. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  So this is exactly the kind of coercion, Tucker, that the Supreme Court has said the First [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=153.84s)]
*  Amendment that the government can't engage in without violating the First Amendment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=158.56s)]
*  It's just so strange that lawmakers in the so-called opposition party sit back like there's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  nothing we can do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=166.24s)]
*  You know, these are private businesses. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=167.24s)]
*  But as you just pointed out, these are not private businesses acting independently. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=169.88s)]
*  They're acting in response to the threats of government, which regulates them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=173.68s)]
*  I think this is one of the key, most overlooked parts of the whole censorship debate is these [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=180.32s)]
*  Silicon Valley companies never set out to want to censor. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=183.96s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=187.56s)]
*  Why would you want to kick people off your platform? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=188.56s)]
*  You want more people on your platform. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=189.84s)]
*  And ideologically, they came out of Silicon Valley, which is about the free Internet. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=191.92s)]
*  So why are they now doing it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=195.4s)]
*  It's in part because they got pressured by journalists, the New York Times and NBC, saying [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=197.16s)]
*  if you don't censor, you have blood on your hands and you're responsible for the destruction [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=202.24s)]
*  of democracy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=205.32s)]
*  But a big reason is they know that Democrats will start enacting laws and enforcing regulation [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  against them if they don't censor more. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  And they know that because Democrats are saying it explicitly over and over. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=214.68s)]
*  And there's no one they like to censor more than you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=218.68s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald on Substack, to be clear. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=221.0s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCwkCiuhbc&t=224.51999999999998s)]
