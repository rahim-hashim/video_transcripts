# Fear is a control mechanism: Gavin de Becker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg)
*  In these last three years, we were told, stay in your house and don't go outside, don't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=0.0s)]
*  go to work, don't see your family on Thanksgiving and Christmas. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=10.8s)]
*  Even divorced parents couldn't transfer the kids between households because that would [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  be two households getting together. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=19.44s)]
*  I mean, the madness of this science fiction movie, given the fact that people love freedom [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=21.28s)]
*  so much, is a really interesting thing for us to reflect on as a society. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=28.08s)]
*  How did we do that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=33.12s)]
*  How did we have that constitution that when we got away from the British, we basically [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=34.36s)]
*  said to the king, you can't come in my house without permission. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=39.04s)]
*  A normal king would say, I beg your pardon, you're my subject. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=42.2s)]
*  That's my house you're talking about. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  But America took this different approach and wrote this extraordinary document and others, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=47.3s)]
*  the constitution being one of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=53.2s)]
*  And I think if you look at world history, which is what I tend to do when I look at [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=55.08s)]
*  human behavior, you have a pie chart. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  Almost all of that pie chart is tyranny as a leadership strategy for human beings. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=62.64s)]
*  And only this tiny, tiny sliver is the United States and Western Europe and Australia and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=67.42s)]
*  New Zealand back in the day that really focused on the freedom of the individual and that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=72.56s)]
*  built a whole society around that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=78.28s)]
*  We must never assume that's going to last because again, pie chart, all tyranny, just [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=80.24s)]
*  this tiny sliver. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=86.56s)]
*  Tyranny is actually the more normal way for human leadership to work. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=88.1s)]
*  Leadership is not even the right word, domination. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=92.96s)]
*  That is the more normal way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  And so in my work, the looking at predicting human behavior, I looked at this right at [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  the beginning, these lockdowns, for example, and I said, all right, we're being asked to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  fear something. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=106.52s)]
*  Let me study what it is that we're being asked to fear because fear is a control mechanism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=107.6s)]
*  Sometimes it's true. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  The beginning of the pandemic, I'm like everybody else. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=113.24s)]
*  We only knew two metrics, over 60 die. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=115.52s)]
*  That's all we knew about COVID. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  That's all we were told. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=120.72s)]
*  So I'm like everybody else. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=121.72s)]
*  So wash off the deliveries coming into the house. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=122.72s)]
*  Oh, you can touch the pizza box, but you can't touch. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=124.92s)]
*  Oh, you can touch the pizza, but you can't touch the box. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=126.8s)]
*  You got to wipe it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  All the madness that went on. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  But I only had that information. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=131.16s)]
*  Was it worth stopping the planet Earth for? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=132.88s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=135.92s)]
*  It turns out it wasn't. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  Did people die from COVID? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Did fit, healthy young people die from COVID? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  No, didn't happen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Very, very rare and usually with kids who were hospitalized for other things. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=144.48s)]
*  So I looked at that and I bring it back to the point you were raising about fear and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=149.4s)]
*  prediction. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=154.6s)]
*  Governments throughout human history use fear to control their citizens. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=156.48s)]
*  Gavin De Becker, remember that name. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=161.64s)]
*  You can stream that conversation right now on Fox Nation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prB_8M-AtOg&t=164.92s)]
