# Gabbard pulls out wild card in feud with Romney
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE)
*  It's up pretty recently, it was considered totally out of bounds to question someone's patriotism [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=0.0s)]
*  because of a political difference in Washington. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=5.24s)]
*  That was called McCarthyism, and only the lowest sort of people engaged in that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=7.7s)]
*  Now it's completely par for the course for people on the left to accuse you of treason [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=13.42s)]
*  if you dare disagree with Joe Biden in any way. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  Case in point, Tulsi Gabbard, who was a Democrat and a former sitting member of Congress, challenged [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=21.68s)]
*  the idea that it would be a good policy for the United States to fight a hot war with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=26.84s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=33.12s)]
*  For saying that, and by the way she speaks for the overwhelming majority of Americans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=34.12s)]
*  in making that obvious point, but for doing it, members of both parties called her a traitor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=36.84s)]
*  Quote, Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda, wrote Mitt Romney of Utah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=42.28s)]
*  Her treasonous lies may well cost lives. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=47.24s)]
*  Keith Obermann, who was ludicrous but still alive, agreed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  He said Tulsi Gabbard is a quote, Russian asset who belongs in jail. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=54.92s)]
*  Now this kind of stuff flies around the internet all day long and most people just kind of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=59.88s)]
*  shrug it off and keep moving, but Tulsi Gabbard doesn't seem like she's going to. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  She's on the verge of taking legal action against both Mitt Romney and Keith Obermann. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  We should tell you, you probably know Tulsi Gabbard is a US Army Reserve officer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=71.88s)]
*  She joins us tonight to explain her decision. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=75.86s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=78.76s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  So how do you plan to respond to this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=82.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say that I took an oath. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  As you mentioned, I still serve in the US Army Reserves today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=89.8s)]
*  I'm a Lieutenant Colonel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=92.34s)]
*  And 19 years ago when I enlisted in the military, I took an oath to support and defend our Constitution. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=93.9s)]
*  I took that very same oath when I was elected to serve in Congress, where I served for eight [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=104.38s)]
*  Senator Mitt Romney has taken that oath, as has every other member of Congress who has [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=105.38s)]
*  had the privilege of serving. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=109.54s)]
*  And if Mitt Romney had read the Constitution, he would know that treason, the crime that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=111.92s)]
*  he's accusing me of that is punishable by death, is so serious that our founders deemed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  it to be the only crime worthy of being defined in our Constitution. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=123.44s)]
*  And so the situation that we're facing here is a very serious one, not because it's about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=129.24s)]
*  me, but because it has a much bigger impact on our country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=134.04s)]
*  And powerful and influential people basically threaten and intimidate people into silence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=137.68s)]
*  As Mitt Romney, Keith Olbermann and others are doing, they're hoping to achieve that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=144.0s)]
*  effect, that if anybody dares speak out against the government, that if anybody dares to criticize [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  whatever the permanent Washington establishment's narrative is, then you will be smeared as a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=153.32s)]
*  traitorous, you know, treasonous traitor. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=160.0s)]
*  And frankly, it also, if Mitt Romney is serious, seriously believes that I have committed treason, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=163.92s)]
*  why hasn't he brought any evidence or brought charges? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=170.32s)]
*  He clearly doesn't care that there are any consequences or, as I mentioned, he's just [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=173.64s)]
*  trying to intimidate and bully me and others into silence. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=178.72s)]
*  May I ask a question? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  So, so Mitt Romney famously dodged the war in Vietnam. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  He's a coward. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=184.76s)]
*  You serve in the U.S. military. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=186.0s)]
*  So you talk to people who also serve and who might be called to fight this war against [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=187.6s)]
*  Russia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=191.2s)]
*  So the people you know who are currently serving in the U.S. military, how many believe that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=192.2s)]
*  raising questions about whether a war with Russia is a good idea constitutes treason? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=195.64s)]
*  Do a lot of your fellow officers think what you said is treasonous? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Not a single person that I know that I've had the privilege of serving with, and even [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=203.6s)]
*  those who I don't know personally, who take this oath to support and defend our Constitution, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=208.54s)]
*  to be loyal to our country, wearing the uniform, knowing that we can be called to give our [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=214.6s)]
*  lives in service to our country at any time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm confident in saying that they would not agree with his accusations. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not I'm not surprised at all. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=226.72s)]
*  The people who actually face the risk understand we need the conversation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=228.32s)]
*  So how do you think you might react to this? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  We'll see. We've sent out the cease and desist letters to both Senator Romney as well as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=236.16s)]
*  Keith Olbermann and Frank Lee Tucker. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=240.44s)]
*  It's in the hopes that they will recognize it's giving them the opportunity to tell the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=242.32s)]
*  American people, you know what? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=246.27999999999997s)]
*  On second thought, we understand how serious this crime of treason is. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=247.84s)]
*  We'll apologize and we'll make sure that this this doesn't happen again, because if we love [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  our country, we care about our democracy, we care about free speech. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=259.08s)]
*  The last thing that anyone with a platform should want to do is to create this chilling [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=262.16s)]
*  effect where people are afraid to express their views, whether they are mainstream or [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=267.6s)]
*  not, whether they are in line with those in power in Washington or not. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=272.36s)]
*  This is America and we all need to stand up and protect this speech because today it's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=276.52s)]
*  me. Tomorrow it could be you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, Olbermann's a sad husband who lives alone with his cats, but Mitt [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=283.28s)]
*  Romney is a sitting U.S. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Senator. So I hope that you will join us with his response because he needs to provide one, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=288.96s)]
*  I would say. Tulsi Gabbard, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=294.08s)]
*  I look forward to it. Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=296.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlsAfWFkUE&t=306.52s)]
