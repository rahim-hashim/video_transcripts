# 23-year-old woman to Tucker: I regret transitioning as a teen
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4)
*  I am Helena. I'm 23 years old. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=0.0s)]
*  When I was about 15, I started using Tumblr. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=7.0s)]
*  I had an eating disorder since I was pretty young. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=13.0s)]
*  There's a lot of messages that said, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=18.0s)]
*  if you feel bad about your body, that means you're trans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=20.0s)]
*  I was just going through this period of like, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=23.0s)]
*  I don't like how I'm treated as a cis person. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=26.0s)]
*  I don't want to be cis because cis means you're uncool [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=29.0s)]
*  and you're privileged and you're an oppressor and you're bad, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=32.0s)]
*  and I don't want to be that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=34.0s)]
*  In that way, I was really incentivized to try to figure out a way [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=38.0s)]
*  to make my voice heard in these communities. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=42.0s)]
*  And obviously, I can't change my race. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=47.0s)]
*  I can't really change my sexuality. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=49.0s)]
*  So the only thing left was to start playing around with the gender stuff. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=52.0s)]
*  So I decided to call myself a demigirl, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=57.0s)]
*  which is one of the 40 million genders. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=61.0s)]
*  And that basically means that I'm mostly a girl, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=64.0s)]
*  but I'm a little bit not a girl, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=66.0s)]
*  which is just like, what does that even mean? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=68.0s)]
*  And then after that, I went to demi-boy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=70.0s)]
*  And then after that, I went to gender fluid. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=73.0s)]
*  And after that, I eventually went to trans-boy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=76.0s)]
*  But all this took like two or three years [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=79.0s)]
*  of just going through this repetitive cycle [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=82.0s)]
*  of changing this identity and changing it again. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=85.0s)]
*  And it was just never enough. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=88.0s)]
*  There was a lot of hopelessness for a long time, a lot of regret. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=97.0s)]
*  The feeling of regret was intense. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=102.0s)]
*  Ah, it's a moving interview, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=110.0s)]
*  and there's a lot more of it in the episode. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=112.0s)]
*  I want to thank everyone that joins us on set now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=114.0s)]
*  And thanks so much for coming out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=116.0s)]
*  There's something so sad about that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=118.0s)]
*  First of all, thank you for speaking up, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=119.0s)]
*  because your voice does matter, I think, in this conversation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=121.0s)]
*  But you felt what every young woman I've ever met felt at a certain age, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=123.0s)]
*  which is uncomfortable with yourself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=129.0s)]
*  And it feels like you were exploited at that moment of weakness. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=131.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=134.0s)]
*  I mean, as you said, it's completely normal for not only young girls, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=135.0s)]
*  but often young boys too, to feel uncomfortable with themselves, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=138.0s)]
*  uncomfortable with their body. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=141.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=142.0s)]
*  because you have this ideology that is especially prevalent online [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=144.0s)]
*  that says that if you have those feelings, that means you're trans. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=147.0s)]
*  I mean, there are literally people who say, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=150.0s)]
*  if you don't even like your voice on a recording, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=152.0s)]
*  that's a sign of gender dysphoria, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=155.0s)]
*  and you need to go see a medical professional because you're trans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=156.0s)]
*  Talk about taking advantage of people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=161.0s)]
*  So how do you, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=163.0s)]
*  and this is all explained in greater depth in the documentary, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=164.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a good thing that you're taking advantage of people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=167.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=170.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=171.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=172.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=173.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=174.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=175.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=176.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=177.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=178.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=179.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=180.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=181.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=182.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=183.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=184.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=185.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=186.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=187.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just devastating to, especially from a young age, be lied to by adults at [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=189.0s)]
*  school and by medical professionals and told that your body is wrong, you need to change [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=194.0s)]
*  it, you need to get hormones, you need to get surgeries. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=198.0s)]
*  That's devastating for a young person. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=200.0s)]
*  So I'm just really concerned for younger girls and boys like I once was being led down this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=202.0s)]
*  path and being hurt by it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=208.0s)]
*  It's a failure of adult leadership. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=211.0s)]
*  And it does seem like it's a failure of adult leadership. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=214.0s)]
*  And it does seem like some of the steps are medically irreversible. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=216.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=219.0s)]
*  I mean, there's all sorts of, you know, the White House actually just put out a chart [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=220.0s)]
*  yesterday that says that some of these steps are reversible or partially reversible. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=225.0s)]
*  But that's such an oversimplification of the truth. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=229.0s)]
*  I mean, when you go on a cross-sex hormone, like, that's going to give you not just physical [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=231.0s)]
*  changes, but psychological experiences that you can't just act like they never happened. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=237.0s)]
*  You can't just take it back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=241.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=242.0s)]
*  And especially with surgeries, you know, a breast implant after a mastectomy is not [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=243.0s)]
*  the same thing as never having your breast taken off in the first place. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=248.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of young women who are going through that who had a double mastectomy at [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=251.0s)]
*  16, 17, 18 years old or even younger. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=255.0s)]
*  That happens. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=258.0s)]
*  Who, you know, there's nothing you can really do to put that feeling of oneness and safety [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=259.0s)]
*  in your body back. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=267.0s)]
*  Oh, it's just it's heartbreaking. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=269.0s)]
*  I hope people are hearing you with open minds, with tolerance. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=271.0s)]
*  Are they? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=275.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there, especially parents, who are really thankful for what [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=276.0s)]
*  I'm saying, because they see that their young girl or their young boy is going through this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=280.0s)]
*  and the school is telling them you need to affirm them they're trans, you need to transition [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=284.0s)]
*  them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=288.0s)]
*  All their doctors are telling them you need to transition them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=289.0s)]
*  And these parents, they know that their child should not be having these cosmetic procedures. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=291.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of parents who are really thankful. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=297.0s)]
*  There are other young people who are really thankful that I'm saying what I'm saying. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=299.0s)]
*  But obviously, you know, you have the trans activists and the trans community that exhibits [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=302.0s)]
*  some very unhealthy kind of cult-like dynamics who are really upset about this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=307.0s)]
*  Man, you are so articulate and thoughtful at 23. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=312.0s)]
*  It's just it's remarkable. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=316.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=317.0s)]
*  People who have suffered like you have sometimes get deeper. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah, you learn a lot. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=320.0s)]
*  Like I said, I learned a lot. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=321.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=323.0s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=324.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=326.0s)]
*  You're going to hear her full story and others of people like her who've been through this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=327.0s)]
*  on Fox Nation in early May. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=331.0s)]
*  It's one of a bunch of episodes we've been working on. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibq3ld087Y4&t=333.0s)]
