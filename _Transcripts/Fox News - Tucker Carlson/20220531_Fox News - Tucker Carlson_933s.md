# Tucker: This is a power grab
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, it was a week ago today that a deranged teenager [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=2.08s)]
*  called Salvador Ramos murdered 19 children [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=5.36s)]
*  and two teachers in an elementary school in Texas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=7.96s)]
*  You know this because we've had seven days [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=11.14s)]
*  of full saturation coverage and it's all deserved. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Given that, it's amazing what we still don't know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=16.36s)]
*  about what happened that day. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=19.68s)]
*  Let's start just because it's the most obvious [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=21.6s)]
*  with how the shooter could possibly have afforded [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=23.36s)]
*  the firearms he used. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=25.76s)]
*  Salvador Ramos was 18 years old. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=27.68s)]
*  He worked part-time at the drive-thru at a local Wendy's. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=29.8s)]
*  Yet police say he had at least $4,000 of brand new weapons [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=32.88s)]
*  including two AR-15 rifles, 1,600 rounds of 5.56 ammunition, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=36.64s)]
*  a ballistic vest and 60 magazines. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=42.0s)]
*  One of Ramos' rifles was a high-end model [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=44.92s)]
*  manufactured by a company called Daniel Defense. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=47.28s)]
*  According to a receipt that Ramos posted [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=50.28s)]
*  in a private message, that gun cost $2,000 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=52.28s)]
*  and he paid in full. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=55.82000000000001s)]
*  Now Ramos could have bought effectively [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  the very same rifle at any gun store [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=59.48s)]
*  for a third of the cost. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=61.8s)]
*  But apparently to Ramos, price was no object. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=63.64s)]
*  That's pretty weird. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=66.6s)]
*  If police know where Ramos got the money [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=68.44s)]
*  to buy one of the most expensive AR-15s on the market, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  they're not telling us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=73.0s)]
*  Nor for that matter, have they explained why they lied [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=74.72s)]
*  about the most basic facts of the shooting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=77.14s)]
*  For the first 24 hours, they told us [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=79.82s)]
*  that a school resource officer fired at the gunman. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  He quote, engaged Ramos. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=84.28s)]
*  But they must have known at the time they said it [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=86.28s)]
*  that that was not true. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=88.52s)]
*  They must have known the resource officer [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=89.96s)]
*  was not even at the school when Ramos arrived. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=91.8s)]
*  But they told us otherwise, why'd they do that? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, how long was Ramos outside the school [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=98.0s)]
*  firing his gun at people at a nearby funeral home [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=100.64s)]
*  before he went inside and killed children? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  That seems like a fairly simple question. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=105.96s)]
*  It's certainly an important question. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=107.84s)]
*  Last week, authorities told us that Ramos [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=109.58s)]
*  was outside the school for 10 to 12 minutes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  Here's the claim. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=114.24s)]
*  We got a crash and a man with a gun. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=115.76s)]
*  And you have responding officers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=120.52s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=123.86s)]
*  It is 12 minutes from 1130 to 1140. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=124.88s)]
*  That's the information we have. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=130.4s)]
*  12 minutes from 1130 to 1140, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=133.16s)]
*  that's the information we have, quote. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=136.6s)]
*  But that information is clearly wrong [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=138.92s)]
*  because 1130 to 1140 is not 10 minutes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=140.72s)]
*  The timeline matters. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=144.72s)]
*  So what's the real timeline? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=146.12s)]
*  Well, on Friday, the director of Texas DPS [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=148.64s)]
*  came up with a brand new timeline. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=150.8s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=153.12s)]
*  1128, the suspect vehicle crashes into the ditch [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=154.64s)]
*  as previously described. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=158.36s)]
*  The teacher runs to the room 132 to retrieve a phone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=160.32s)]
*  And that same teacher walks back to the exit door [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=163.68s)]
*  and door remains propped open. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=166.76s)]
*  1133, the suspect begins shooting at the room 111 or 112. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=168.6s)]
*  It's not possible to determine from the video angle [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=173.76s)]
*  that we have at this point in time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=176.92s)]
*  So actually, and that was the director [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=180.16s)]
*  of public safety in Texas, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  it was only five minutes that Ramos [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=183.44s)]
*  was outside shooting at people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=185.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=186.6s)]
*  But here's the key takeaway from that statement. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=187.72s)]
*  Here's what they want you to believe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=190.2s)]
*  The back door to the school was open [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=191.92s)]
*  because a teacher at the school left it open [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  after going outside to retrieve a phone. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=196.84s)]
*  So it's the teacher's fault that Ramos [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=199.54s)]
*  was able to get inside. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=201.0s)]
*  That's what they said on Friday. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=202.56s)]
*  But this too appears to be untrue. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=204.72s)]
*  The Houston Chronicle is reporting tonight [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=207.84s)]
*  that surveillance footage of the school [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=209.48s)]
*  shows that the teacher slammed the door [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=211.52s)]
*  after running back inside. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=214.18s)]
*  And of course that would make sense [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=215.56s)]
*  since by this point Ramos was firing his rifle [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=217.24s)]
*  and that same teacher was using the phone in question [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=220.52s)]
*  to make a panic call to 911. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=223.12s)]
*  No one disputes that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=225.76s)]
*  So why did the authorities tell us otherwise? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=227.52s)]
*  And for that matter, why did they initially deny [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=230.88s)]
*  that the on-scene police commander ordered cops [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=233.08s)]
*  to stand down and remain outside [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=235.48s)]
*  as children were being shot to death inside the school? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=237.8s)]
*  On Thursday, a spokesman for Texas DPS [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=241.4s)]
*  called that account a rumor, quote, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=243.4s)]
*  but there was video tape to show that it was true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=246.8s)]
*  It actually happened. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  So the next day, forced by the video tape, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=250.24s)]
*  Texas DPS admitted the rumors were true. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=252.32s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  What efforts would the officer making to try and break [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=257.32s)]
*  either that door or another door, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=260.64s)]
*  get inside that classroom? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=263.0s)]
*  None at that time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=264.8s)]
*  Why, why? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=266.32s)]
*  The on-scene commander at the time [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  believed that it had transitioned from an active shooter [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=271.08s)]
*  to a barricaded subject. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=274.28s)]
*  Sir, how people who are alive, children who are calling 911 [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=276.36s)]
*  say, please send the police. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=282.28s)]
*  They are alive. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=285.16s)]
*  In that classroom, there are lives that are at risk. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=286.32s)]
*  Hey, we're well aware of that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Obviously, you know, based upon the information we have, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=293.2s)]
*  there were children in that classroom that were at risk. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=297.4s)]
*  And it was in fact still an active shooter situation [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=300.04s)]
*  and not a barricaded subject. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=303.04s)]
*  But that's not really an explanation, of course, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=305.96s)]
*  because no one disputes that everyone on the scene, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=308.12s)]
*  including police, knew that Ramos had weapons, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=311.2s)]
*  was firing them at people to kill people, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=314.68s)]
*  and was inside the school with children. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=318.0s)]
*  No one disputes that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=322.52s)]
*  So why did heavily armed police units decide not to stop [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=324.24s)]
*  Salvador Ramos from executing children? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, that's not finger pointing to ask that question. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=331.28s)]
*  These are very complicated circumstances. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=333.44s)]
*  People are under immense pressure. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  People make mistakes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  But we are making long-term policy decisions [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  based on the specifics of what happened last week in Uvalde. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=343.6s)]
*  Politicians across this country are calling [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=346.44s)]
*  for militarizing America's elementary schools. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=348.48s)]
*  And yet they can't answer why the military force [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  effectively outside this elementary school [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=354.6s)]
*  refused to stop the killing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=358.72s)]
*  So this massacre could have been prevented at some point. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=361.44s)]
*  It was not prevented. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  Why was that? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=364.92s)]
*  We should know the answer, but don't hold your breath. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=366.72s)]
*  No one in power seems anxious to hold themselves [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=369.88s)]
*  accountable for what happened in Uvalde. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=372.24s)]
*  And amazingly, and this is so perverse, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  it's hard to believe it's true, but it is, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=377.52s)]
*  some seem determined to make future school shootings [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  more likely. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=382.32s)]
*  In California, the state assembly just voted [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=384.0s)]
*  to end the requirement, the longstanding requirement [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=386.08s)]
*  that was put in place after school shootings, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=389.44s)]
*  that schools alert law enforcement when students quote, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=391.36s)]
*  attack, assault, or physically threaten school officials. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=394.48s)]
*  That's no longer in place. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=398.36s)]
*  And according to the Democratic party, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=399.8s)]
*  that's a win for equity. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=401.72s)]
*  We know this because the sponsor of the bill, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  a California state Senator called Stephen Bradford said so. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=405.2s)]
*  Here's what he told the Daily Caller, quote, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=407.92s)]
*  black students, Latinx students, students of color, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=409.8s)]
*  and students with disabilities are disproportionately [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=412.96s)]
*  referred to law enforcement, cited and arrested, end quote. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  So too many Latinx students in wheelchairs [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  apparently are being blamed for school shootings. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=422.4s)]
*  So there's no more violence reporting [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=424.56s)]
*  in California schools at all. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=426.24s)]
*  So how does that help prevent the next school shooting? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=429.32s)]
*  Well, of course it doesn't, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=432.2s)]
*  but it's starting to seem like helping prevent [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=434.24s)]
*  school shootings is not really the point of this exercise. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=436.52s)]
*  Amassing more power is the point. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  And we know this from what's happening north of us. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=443.12s)]
*  Canada's Botox dictator, Justin Trudeau, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  wasted no time in using the tragedy in the US [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=447.92s)]
*  to his own political advantage in Canada. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=450.6s)]
*  Now, Uvalde is more than 2000 miles from Ottawa, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=452.96s)]
*  but because of what Salvador Ramos was allowed to do [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=456.52s)]
*  in Texas, Canadians are no longer allowed [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=458.92s)]
*  to protect themselves. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Justin Trudeau was introduced to a bill [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  that would ban Canadian citizens from buying, selling, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  and transferring handguns within their own country. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  Again, handguns were not the cause [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=469.48s)]
*  of the shooting in Uvalde. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=472.24s)]
*  Uvalde is nowhere near Canada, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=473.6s)]
*  and yet Justin Trudeau is using that tragedy [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  to disarm anyone who disagrees with him. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  By the way, that law would empower courts [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=483.68s)]
*  to confiscate guns from people, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=486.16s)]
*  even if they've not committed a crime. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Watch Justin Trudeau announce this paragraph, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  and as you do watch, pay special attention [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=493.84s)]
*  to the masked toadies behind him nodding in unison. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=495.8s)]
*  We're introducing legislation to implement [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=499.92s)]
*  a national freeze on handgun ownership. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=502.96s)]
*  What this means is that it will no longer be possible [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=508.0s)]
*  to buy, sell, transfer, or import handguns [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=511.08s)]
*  anywhere in Canada. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  In other words, we're capping the market for handguns. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=520.2800000000001s)]
*  What's actually happening here is that people [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  like Justin Trudeau know that their rule is illegitimate. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=529.36s)]
*  They know perfectly well how resented they are, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  and they spend an awful lot of time [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  thinking about civil unrest. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=536.84s)]
*  You probably don't. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  You live in a democracy, so you don't imagine [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=540.5200000000001s)]
*  that anyone needs to be disarmed for political reasons, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=543.12s)]
*  but people like Justin Trudeau can feel [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=546.92s)]
*  the deep resentment aimed at them, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=548.52s)]
*  and they are fully intent on disarming the population. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=551.12s)]
*  Now we reached out to Justin Trudeau's office today [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=555.28s)]
*  about this new law. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=557.28s)]
*  We wanted to know if Trudeau will apply these laws [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=558.24s)]
*  to himself. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=561.08s)]
*  That's always the first and most important test of sincerity. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=561.92s)]
*  If it's good for me, it ought to be good for you too, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=565.04s)]
*  and vice versa. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=567.0s)]
*  So in this case, will Justin Trudeau's state-funded [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=568.52s)]
*  bodyguards be relinquishing their handguns, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=571.8s)]
*  how about their banned AR-15s? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=573.92s)]
*  But of course, we're not allowed to know the answers [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=576.5999999999999s)]
*  to that question because he's in power and we're not. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  We do not comment on matters related [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  to the prime minister's security, his office responded, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=582.0799999999999s)]
*  meaning of course not. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  Justin Trudeau isn't that stupid. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  He's gonna continue to protect his own family. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  You're just not gonna be allowed to protect yours in Canada. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=590.8s)]
*  Now here in the United States, as always, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  Democrats are watching very carefully what Trudeau [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  is up to as they plan our future here. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=597.24s)]
*  And already the rhetoric of the Democratic Party [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  has changed for years. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=602.68s)]
*  Democrats, Joe Biden, his supporters in the media [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  have talked about banning AR-15s, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=607.2399999999999s)]
*  the so-called weapons of war, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=609.04s)]
*  which are not in fact used by any military. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=610.64s)]
*  But weapons of war have been their focus. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=612.5999999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=615.8s)]
*  The venom of the haters and their weapons of war. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  Assault-style weapons that are weapons of war. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  And purchase these weapons of war. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=626.0s)]
*  To get these weapons of war. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=628.12s)]
*  We're finally ridding our streets of weapons of war. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=630.0s)]
*  What we should be doing is taking these weapons of war [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=633.36s)]
*  out of the hands of civilians. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  Because they see what these weapons of war [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  do on the street. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  An assault weapon is a weapon of war [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  with no place, no place in a civil society. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=645.96s)]
*  They wouldn't know what end the bullet comes out of. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  They know nothing about this topic. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=653.36s)]
*  They don't even know the basic crime stats. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  In the United States, rifles kill fewer people every year [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  than fists or knives do. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=660.92s)]
*  There's no effort afoot to ban knives or fists. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  But weapons of war have long been their focus. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=666.0s)]
*  Meaning AR-15s, the single most popular self-defense rifle [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=669.52s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=673.88s)]
*  Self-defense is the point. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=674.76s)]
*  On Sunday, Congressman Adam Kinzinger has decided, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=676.3599999999999s)]
*  and says it out loud, that in order for him to feel safe, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=679.64s)]
*  we're gonna need to confiscate your rifle. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=682.8s)]
*  Because he feels unsafe. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=684.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=686.04s)]
*  Can you do still oppose a ban on the kind of assault weapons [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=686.88s)]
*  that were used in the shooting? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=690.4399999999999s)]
*  Can you explain why private citizens need weapons of war? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=692.0s)]
*  Look, I have opposed a ban, you know, fairly recently. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=697.6s)]
*  I think I'm open to a ban now. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=701.6s)]
*  Can you explain, Congressman, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=705.12s)]
*  why private citizens need weapons of war? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=706.96s)]
*  Now, CNN anchors need to be surrounded by bodyguards [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=710.32s)]
*  with weapons of war because they're important. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=712.72s)]
*  But you and your family? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=714.4s)]
*  No, you don't need weapons of war. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=716.04s)]
*  So for years, it's been about the AR-15. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=718.0s)]
*  But things are changing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=721.24s)]
*  Joe Biden is now calling for a ban [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=723.52s)]
*  on the ubiquitous nine millimeter round. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=725.92s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=729.04s)]
*  A nine millimeter bullet blows the lung out of the body. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=731.68s)]
*  So the idea of these high caliber weapons [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  is there is simply no rational basis for it [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=740.16s)]
*  in terms of what you hear about self-protection, hunting. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=745.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess, I don't remember. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  The constitution, the second amendment, was never absolute. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=752.8s)]
*  You couldn't buy a cannon when the second amendment was back. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=756.1999999999999s)]
*  So there's a guy who can't even recognize his own wife [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  of 40 years in public lecturing us [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=763.28s)]
*  about what the rational basis is for this or that quote. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=765.52s)]
*  There's simply no rational basis for the nine millimeter round [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=768.52s)]
*  in terms of self-protection. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=771.56s)]
*  Well, of course, the opposite is true. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  The nine millimeter is the main self-protection round [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=775.68s)]
*  in the United States, along with the 556, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=779.12s)]
*  the round used in the AR-15. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  Both of them are small rounds. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=782.92s)]
*  People use them to protect their families. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=786.36s)]
*  And if you take them away, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=789.7199999999999s)]
*  Americans will no longer be able to defend themselves [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=791.12s)]
*  in the middle of a crime wave that was wholly manufactured [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  by the same people who are trying to strip your guns from you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=796.68s)]
*  And that's of course the point. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=799.28s)]
*  This is a power grab. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=800.12s)]
*  And you can be certain that it is a power grab [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  but not an effort to make this a safer country [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=803.44s)]
*  because the people who are calling for it [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=805.44s)]
*  are exempting themselves from its requirements once again. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  That is the acid test. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=811.1600000000001s)]
*  If you're for a law, will it apply to you? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=813.48s)]
*  Do Michael Bloomberg's bodyguards [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=817.2s)]
*  carry the dreaded nine millimeter or two, two, three rounds? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=818.84s)]
*  Do they have high capacity magazines? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=821.8000000000001s)]
*  Do Nancy Pelosi's bodyguards, which you pay for, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=824.5200000000001s)]
*  do Mitch McConnell's bodyguards carry those rounds? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=826.72s)]
*  Well, we wanted to know. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=830.36s)]
*  Why wouldn't we want to know? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=831.24s)]
*  Why don't we have a right to know? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=832.4s)]
*  So we emailed all three of their offices today. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=833.64s)]
*  And unlike, we have to say, Justin Trudeau's office, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  none of them even bothered to reply to us. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=839.12s)]
*  So obviously they won't be disarming their own bodyguards. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  They'll keep their own weapons of war. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, they'll continue to pass legislation [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=849.08s)]
*  against weapons they know nothing about. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=851.36s)]
*  They've been doing this for decades. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=853.24s)]
*  We did a documentary on this actually. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=855.92s)]
*  And we spoke to probably the person who knows more [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=857.88s)]
*  about self-defense weapons than any living American, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=861.12s)]
*  Hickok45, one of the most popular figures on YouTube [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=864.2s)]
*  and truly an expert on the use of firearms for self-defense. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=868.32s)]
*  Here's part of what he told us. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=872.36s)]
*  And of course it has the famous [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=875.84s)]
*  Tucker Carlson barrel shroud on it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=878.16s)]
*  Barrel shroud. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=879.96s)]
*  Hickok45 is referring to Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=881.2s)]
*  of New York, who famously didn't understand the firearm [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=884.8s)]
*  she was trying to ban. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=888.04s)]
*  Do you know what a barrel shroud is? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=889.04s)]
*  I actually don't know what a barrel shroud is. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=891.88s)]
*  Because it's in your legislation. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=893.2s)]
*  I think it's a shoulder thing that goes up. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=894.04s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=895.36s)]
*  So a barrel shroud makes the rifle more deadly, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=896.2s)]
*  Really, shrouds that barrel. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=899.36s)]
*  You know, a lot of what people come up with [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=901.48s)]
*  that do not know firearms, they just do not like them. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=903.2s)]
*  They hate them. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=906.32s)]
*  And so they're looking for reasons to hate them. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=907.16s)]
*  They don't know anything about the cartridges. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=909.28s)]
*  A bullet is dangerous. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=911.16s)]
*  Let's face it, a hammer, a chainsaw, a ladder, a car, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  they're potentially dangerous. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=916.24s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_d0juMwLmQ&t=921.36s)]
