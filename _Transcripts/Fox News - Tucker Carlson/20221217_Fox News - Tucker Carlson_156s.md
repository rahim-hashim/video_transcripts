# This was the biggest group of migrants Bill Melugin has ever seen
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps)
*  Bill Mollugian has covered the border more closely than any reporter in the United States for the last two years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=0.0s)]
*  And today, in his estimation, the single largest caravan of illegal aliens [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=4.8s)]
*  flowing into this country in his two years of watching crossed today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=10.64s)]
*  He broke the story. He's got remarkable video for us. He's live at the border now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=13.84s)]
*  Bill, great to see you. What did you see? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Tucker, good evening to you. You mentioned it right off the top. This was easily the biggest group we have [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  ever seen during our 19 months of covering this border crisis. And they all crossed illegally into [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=26.64s)]
*  El Paso last night. And we got some pretty wild camera footage to show you. Take a look at this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=31.76s)]
*  This was last night in El Paso, a massive caravan of over 1000 illegal immigrants crossing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=35.92s)]
*  into El Paso last night. Local media there reporting it was potentially up to 2000 people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=42.8s)]
*  and that it was possibly the biggest mass crossing in the city's history. Now, as you look at the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=47.6s)]
*  video, you'll see just wave after wave after wave of these people walking across the river and then [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=52.4s)]
*  gathering on the U.S. side of the river where they kind of form a single file line. And you'll see that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=57.92s)]
*  single file line start stretching almost as far as the eye can see as again, well over 1000 people [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=63.12s)]
*  crossed there and it was cold there last night. So you'll see many of them started setting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  campfires in an effort to keep warm. And CBP sources tell Fox News that over the last 24 hours [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=73.36s)]
*  in that sector in El Paso, there have been more than 2400 illegal crossings. Border Patrol there [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=79.68s)]
*  has more than 5000 migrants in custody right now. They're completely overwhelmed, completely over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=85.68s)]
*  capacity. So they've started mass releases of these people. They're just dropping hundreds of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=91.2s)]
*  them off at a time in El Paso city streets. So the question here, where did all these people come from? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  We'll show you. They were bussed in with a Mexican police escort. Take a look at the second piece of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  video here. Fox News on scene in Ciudad Juarez has about 20 of these migrant buses filled with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=106.4s)]
*  these migrants, received a Mexican police escort into Ciudad Juarez, the city directly across from [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=112.0s)]
*  El Paso. And then they were all dropped off at local shelters and NGOs there in Juarez. But of course, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  they didn't stay at those shelters. They all started walking over to the river, walking to the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=124.48s)]
*  border. And as you can see from the video, they started crossing in mass. Bizarre to see the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=128.8s)]
*  Mexican government essentially escorting them there to have them cross just a few minutes later. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=133.04s)]
*  And back out here live, Tucker, the numbers just exploding here at our southern border with the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=137.2s)]
*  U.S. Border Patrol chief saying in the last 48 hours, there have been more than 16,000 illegal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  crossings averaging out to 8000 per day. Send it back to you. Biggest crime of our lifetimes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=147.2s)]
*  Bill Mugin, thanks so much. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skFfbkAOps&t=154.16s)]
