# Tucker Carlson rips Amazon's modern-day book burning
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY)
*  So you go on Amazon.com and you remember this started as a bookstore, an online bookstore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the biggest bookstore in the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  They have everything. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=9.32s)]
*  There's nothing you can't find on Amazon, including used books. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=10.32s)]
*  So if you were to go onto Amazon to read books by a man who is in the news and whose ideas [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=13.4s)]
*  are directly bearing on world events, you would look for a guy called Alexander Dugin. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=18.76s)]
*  Dugin is one of Russia's most famous authors and political philosophers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=24.12s)]
*  He doesn't work for the government. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=27.84s)]
*  He doesn't work for Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=28.84s)]
*  He's just a philosopher. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=30.24s)]
*  So if you were interested in like, what are they thinking over there, you would search [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=31.64s)]
*  Dugin's author page on Amazon, but you would not find any results. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=34.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=38.28s)]
*  Kind of a big author to be left off Amazon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=39.28s)]
*  So we reach out to Amazon to ask, why can't we find any books by this guy? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=41.8s)]
*  And then we realized because he's been banned from Amazon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=47.96s)]
*  So then we asked Amazon for a list of all books and authors who've been banned from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  their platform and they wouldn't give it to us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=54.32s)]
*  So we went back and forth, back and forth. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=57.0s)]
*  And finally, Amazon provided a six word response and we're quoting, Amazon complies with all [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=58.64s)]
*  applicable laws. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=63.12s)]
*  Well, in the United States, there are no laws against publishing books because we have the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=66.12s)]
*  first amendment. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=69.72s)]
*  The government can never under any circumstances censor any book, period, or anything that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=70.72s)]
*  you have to say, period, because that's the core of our bill of rights. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=77.82s)]
*  Then we learned that Amazon and the Justice Department were ignoring our bill of rights. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=84.0s)]
*  Amazon apparently based this decision on a Treasury Department designation concerning [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=87.72s)]
*  quote disinformation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=91.2s)]
*  And that designation applies not only to Dugin, but also to his family, though not to his [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=93.72s)]
*  daughter who was murdered recently by the Ukrainian government. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=97.32s)]
*  Boron all had to say that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=99.68s)]
*  What did she do wrong? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=100.68s)]
*  Well, I guess she said the wrong thing, but that's cool because they're fighting for freedom. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=101.68s)]
*  But that's not the point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  The point is in our country, which is very different from Ukraine, we're allowed to read [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  whatever we want. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=109.56s)]
*  But we can't now because the Biden administration is demanding that the biggest bookseller in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=111.74s)]
*  the world censor books that they disagree with. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  And Amazon complies without asking any questions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=120.58s)]
*  Now, this is as clear a violation as the first amendment as you could concoct in a law school [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  class. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  So then we reached out to the Treasury Department. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  Did this really happen? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=132.74s)]
*  Yeah, it did. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=134.7s)]
*  They essentially confirmed it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  Quote, we don't comment on possible enforcement matters, but the Treasury Department continues [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=137.78s)]
*  to vigorously enforce Russia related sanctions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=141.8s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=144.76s)]
*  There is no legal basis for ever censoring any book if you're the U.S. government. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=146.92s)]
*  That is not allowed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=153.16s)]
*  That's the main thing that's not allowed in this country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=154.16s)]
*  Period. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=155.92s)]
*  We don't care who wrote the book. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=156.92s)]
*  You're allowed to read it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=158.66s)]
*  You can read any book you want. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=159.66s)]
*  You're an American. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=160.66s)]
*  And if you cease to be able to read any book you want, it doesn't matter if you're an American [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=161.66s)]
*  because you're just a serf. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=165.4s)]
*  Well, Amazon has refused to provide us with a list of the other books they are banning, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=167.84s)]
*  but they clearly are banning a lot of different books. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=172.04s)]
*  And why can't we know what those books are? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=174.4s)]
*  We're going to continue to look into this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  And if there are any legal challenges to the book banning, which is one click from book [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=178.04s)]
*  burning, we hope there are legal challenges. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=182.8s)]
*  We'll let you know about those as well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFzkoJWa_tY&t=185.32s)]
