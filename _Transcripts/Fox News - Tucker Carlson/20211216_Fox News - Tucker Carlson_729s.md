# Tucker: This is not a good sign
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY)
*  But first, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's a question. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  What happens when you crush entire sectors of your own economy for nearly two years, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  and then, to compensate for your crime, you decide to inject trillions of dollars of freshly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=8.84s)]
*  printed cash into the system? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=14.24s)]
*  What happens if you do that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=16.16s)]
*  Well, honestly, we don't really know what happens when you do that because no one in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=17.16s)]
*  history has ever been stupid enough to try it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=20.84s)]
*  It's going to be years before we really understand the consequences of all this, of our government's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=23.88s)]
*  reckless coronavirus policy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=27.84s)]
*  But in the meantime, we can say with total confidence that the American economy is getting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=30.08s)]
*  very weird. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=34.4s)]
*  Not all of it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=36.44s)]
*  Some of what we're seeing isn't weird in the slightest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=37.44s)]
*  It was, in fact, entirely predictable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=38.8s)]
*  If you create trillions of U.S. dollars out of nothing, U.S. dollars are going to be worth [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=40.74s)]
*  less, much less. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=45.96s)]
*  This is called inflation, and we're suffering through it right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=48.08s)]
*  Inflation, very simply, is the result of too much money in the system. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=51.08s)]
*  If you have too much of something, it's value false supply and demand, remember? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=53.84s)]
*  This is what's causing the rise in real estate prices, and of Bitcoin, and of other assets [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=58.0s)]
*  that investors run to when they no longer trust the country's currency. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  Why can't you afford a house right now? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  Simple, because Washington printed too much money. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=68.4s)]
*  No one should be surprised by this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=71.58000000000001s)]
*  It's a cycle as old as money itself. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=73.36s)]
*  Political leaders devalue the currency for short-term gain. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  In the end, this leads to long-term collapse. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=78.76s)]
*  The basing the coinage, that's what they used to call it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=81.96s)]
*  For example, by the middle of the third century, the Roman denarius, the silver coin, was only [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=84.44s)]
*  about 2% actual silver. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  The rest of it was just junk. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=90.72s)]
*  Within a few years, not incidentally, the entire Roman Empire blew up, and the barbarians [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  took over. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  But it wasn't just the Romans who did this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Every government devalues its currency at some point. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=100.36s)]
*  They do it because it's irresistible. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  You cannot do it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=104.16s)]
*  If you do it, you get free money, and you don't have to raise taxes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=105.74s)]
*  But in the end, every government pays the price for doing this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=109.2s)]
*  Or more precisely, its citizens do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=112.84s)]
*  So the current inflation, horrible as it is, is hardly unexpected. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=115.16s)]
*  You'd really have to be a Fed chairman not to have seen it coming. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=119.08s)]
*  What's confusing as hell is our labor market. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=123.44s)]
*  The unemployment rate is higher than it was before COVID. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=127.5s)]
*  Not a ton, but some. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=130.24s)]
*  That means fewer people have jobs than did two years ago. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=131.44s)]
*  Labor force participation, meanwhile, a slightly different measurement, is way down. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=134.8s)]
*  That means fewer people are working or even looking for jobs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=138.96s)]
*  So that's the picture on one side of the labor market. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=142.28s)]
*  And yet, this is the truly bizarre part, we are simultaneously experiencing a serious [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  labor shortage. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=150.28s)]
*  So we have a shortage of labor and a glut of labor simultaneously. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=151.28s)]
*  In some places, businesses have shut down because they can't find employees, as you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  well know if you live here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  So again, at the very same moment, we have both too many workers and also too few workers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=160.98s)]
*  That does not make sense. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=168.14s)]
*  How can that possibly be happening? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  And again, we're going to be honest and tell you we're not entirely sure how it's happening. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=172.54s)]
*  No one is entirely sure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  But we can tell you it's definitely not natural. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=178.38s)]
*  This is not how markets are supposed to work. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=180.98s)]
*  This is not a good sign. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=183.28s)]
*  If you were running the country and you were a responsible person, you'd be very concerned [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  about a trend like this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=189.42s)]
*  But our leaders don't seem especially concerned. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=191.0s)]
*  Consider Lisa Cook. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  She's a professor of economics at Michigan State University. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  Cook has advised Joe Biden on economic policies. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  She's now considered a shoe-in for an appointment to the Federal Reserve Board. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  So soon, Lisa Cook will be one of the people in charge of fixing this mess. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=204.66s)]
*  How is she going to do at that job? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=208.48s)]
*  Well, the early signs are not especially promising. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=210.2s)]
*  Not long ago, Cook and other faculty members at Michigan State got an email from their [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=213.48s)]
*  It read. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=218.04s)]
*  Turns out food service staff weren't showing up to work. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=221.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=224.04s)]
*  Well, partly because of the economic policies that the White House had enacted on the advice [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=225.04s)]
*  of Lisa Cook. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  And as a result of that, the cafeteria has desperately needed faculty to pitch in and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  help to feed people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=234.64s)]
*  The most basic job of all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=236.56s)]
*  And yet, as far as we know, Lisa Cook, despite her perfectly suited last name, did not help. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  She stayed home. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=244.6s)]
*  Now in case you think we're sailing out Lisa Cook, to be fair, a lot of people are staying [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=246.74s)]
*  home these days. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=250.62s)]
*  They're not pitching in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=251.62s)]
*  The number of Americans who have jobs has dropped by nearly five million people since [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=253.38s)]
*  February of last year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=257.46s)]
*  Now none of these people, according to the government assessment, is looking for a new [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=259.3s)]
*  job. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=262.82s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=263.82s)]
*  Lots of reasons. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=264.82s)]
*  Some of them have retired. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=265.82s)]
*  Others have moved on to work that is difficult for the government to keep track of. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=267.06s)]
*  That's not always a bad thing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=270.18s)]
*  If you've left a soul-crushing job at Citibank to tend an organic apple orchard, kind of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=271.74s)]
*  hard to see how that's a net loss for society. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, we probably should be celebrating that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=278.24s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=280.44s)]
*  The problem is with all the rest. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=281.76s)]
*  Some large percentage of able-bodied Americans have just decided to stop working at all. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Now in the long run, this is a big change. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=289.56s)]
*  It's not good for the national character. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=292.44s)]
*  For example, healthy societies value work. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=293.72s)]
*  They believe it confers dignity and meaning. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  But in the short term, as an economic matter, this is killing small businesses. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=300.16s)]
*  There's a driver shortage in this country, and it's not just hitting the transport of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=306.06s)]
*  goods. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=309.62s)]
*  School bus drivers are in short supply too. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=310.62s)]
*  At Nugget Market, the manager works the register to cover short staffing, a fact of life in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=313.54s)]
*  so many businesses. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=320.44000000000005s)]
*  Some Walgreens pharmacy drive-throughs, like this one at Main and Mason Streets in Green [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  Bay, have been blocked off recently. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  Signs posted on the windows say they don't have enough staff. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=329.1s)]
*  Certain job sectors like retail, restaurants and hospitality are understaffed no matter [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=332.62s)]
*  how you slice it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=338.38s)]
*  The government has incentivized people not to work, so it's really tough to get people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=339.62s)]
*  to work and then once they're here, to stay on for more than six months. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=344.86s)]
*  So why is this happening? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  And again, the signs of it are everywhere. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=354.22s)]
*  There's no room service in your hotel in case you haven't noticed, and that's just the least [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=356.9s)]
*  of it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=360.78s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons this is happening is because government put out some really [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=361.78s)]
*  destructive policies. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=365.84s)]
*  Here's Fox's Will Cain to explain. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=367.02s)]
*  This is the Cathy of B-Bone Cathys. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=369.86s)]
*  So this is the sign you had up front, Cathy, when we came in. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=372.1s)]
*  I don't know if you guys can see that, but we're short staffed. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=374.5s)]
*  Please be patient with the staff that did show up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=377.02s)]
*  No one wants to look to work anymore. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=379.22s)]
*  They would rather draw unemployment. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=381.88s)]
*  Is that really what you're saying? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=383.42s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=384.42s)]
*  That's so true. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm so tired of all of it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  Quit giving all this unemployment. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=388.38s)]
*  They're getting unemployment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=390.34s)]
*  They're getting the stimulus. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=391.82s)]
*  Why work? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=393.41999999999996s)]
*  They make a lot of money. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  They're quitting just so they can get unemployment. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  So you never hear anybody on TV say that, but if you're around people with what we used [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=401.14s)]
*  to call working class jobs, you hear it all the time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  You hear it a lot. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=408.29999999999995s)]
*  People are mad about it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  At the International House of Pancakes in Wasilla, Alaska, not always possible to get [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=410.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=415.92s)]
*  Well, here's the message posted on its front door. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=416.92s)]
*  So there is some truth in this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=426.92s)]
*  At times over the past two years, some people were making much more from government unemployment [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=428.44s)]
*  benefits than they had been making in the jobs that they left. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=433.16s)]
*  One analysis found that thanks to the so-called CARES Act, restaurant workers nearly doubled [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=436.44s)]
*  their weekly pay when they became unemployed. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  The government was literally making it more lucrative for people not to work and stay [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=445.58000000000004s)]
*  at home. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=449.14000000000004s)]
*  That is the definition of insanity. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=450.14000000000004s)]
*  Not only do policies like that wreck our economy and close IHOP, there's an obvious moral cost [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=451.66s)]
*  to them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=457.86s)]
*  What's the message the government is sending here? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=458.86s)]
*  The message is you'd have to be an idiot to work. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=460.3s)]
*  So you've got to wonder what damage that message has done to this country's attitudes about [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=464.66s)]
*  work. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=468.94000000000005s)]
*  And yet, a lot of people didn't go back to work. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=470.66s)]
*  In fact, even more Americans quit their jobs. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=479.86s)]
*  One recent poll found that 73% of Americans are thinking about quitting right now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=482.94s)]
*  And again, this isn't all bad. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=487.26s)]
*  This stuff is very complex and we want to be honest. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=489.18s)]
*  Some jobs aren't worth having. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=491.18s)]
*  We wish people would quit. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=492.58s)]
*  It would be great to see a mass exodus of, say, chief diversity officers from America's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=493.58s)]
*  corporations and liberal arts colleges. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  They could all learn to do tub and tile work. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=500.86s)]
*  It would be far better off as a country if they did. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=502.42s)]
*  We hope they will. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=504.58000000000004s)]
*  And also, we must be honest, for people who do want to work, it's a shrinking number, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=507.38s)]
*  but some do, and there's very good news for them, wages are up dramatically, particularly [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=511.42s)]
*  at the bottom end. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=515.38s)]
*  Some fast food workers are making $18 an hour plus signing bonuses. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=516.78s)]
*  And that seems like something to celebrate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=520.78s)]
*  But of course, no one in Washington is celebrating. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=523.1800000000001s)]
*  This is a victory for Americans who don't have college degrees, and that means a defeat [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=525.2s)]
*  for them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=529.1s)]
*  So in Washington, they're already thinking of ways to use mass immigration to shaft unskilled [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=530.72s)]
*  workers out of their recent gains. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  Quote, immigrants could fix U.S. labor shortage. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=536.72s)]
*  We had a recent headline in Vox. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=539.1600000000001s)]
*  Of course it did. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=540.72s)]
*  The head of Domino's Pizza agrees he'd like to pay his employees less, and he wants to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  use newly imported foreign workers to do it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=545.84s)]
*  How's the White House feel about this? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=548.24s)]
*  Well, of course, Biden's on board with it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  He wants more Democratic voters from foreign countries. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  So what you're looking at is the perfect alignment of malignant motives. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=553.96s)]
*  So expect the borders to stay open. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=558.22s)]
*  But what no one in Washington is thinking about, and what we should all be thinking [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=561.2s)]
*  about, is why is this happening in the first place? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=564.12s)]
*  Why are fewer people choosing to work? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=566.58s)]
*  And have been for a long time, by the way. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  This is not a new trend. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Our labor markets are getting sicker for generations. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=573.48s)]
*  Look at this chart. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  This is one measure of it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  This shows the labor force participation rate of American men. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  It goes back to 1950, 71 years ago. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=580.96s)]
*  What do you notice? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=583.68s)]
*  The line goes straight down. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=584.68s)]
*  Now, here's another chart, similar but different. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=585.68s)]
*  This is the labor force participation rate of women in America. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=588.04s)]
*  And that line moves in the opposite direction. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  So as you can tell, for 70 years we have been losing men in the workforce. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=594.52s)]
*  Now, many call this progress on the assumption that anything that is bad and degrading for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  men must be good for America. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  But it is not progress. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=605.16s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=606.92s)]
*  The average man defines himself by his job. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=607.92s)]
*  Yes, men and women are very different, extremely different. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  Our whole society is built on their differences. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=612.44s)]
*  Every society is. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=614.2800000000001s)]
*  And the thing about men is they kind of need to work. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=615.72s)]
*  They tend to fall apart when they're unemployed. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=619.0200000000001s)]
*  Not all of them do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=621.08s)]
*  But enough of them do that we should be worried when we see trends like this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=622.44s)]
*  But our leaders aren't worried. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=626.5200000000001s)]
*  Heedless as always, the consequences of what they do, they've used COVID to accelerate [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=628.0s)]
*  that trend. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=631.96s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=632.96s)]
*  Who is hurt most by vaccine mandates? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  Well the group least likely to get vaccines. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=637.44s)]
*  That of course is working class men. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=639.36s)]
*  What percentage of New York Times reporters have obeyed Joe Biden and been injected with [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=641.56s)]
*  the vaccine? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=645.2399999999999s)]
*  Well, probably around 100%. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=646.2399999999999s)]
*  Among men who work in oil fields, that number is closer to 10%. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=648.2399999999999s)]
*  Massive difference. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=653.5999999999999s)]
*  Massive disparate effect. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=655.1199999999999s)]
*  Like a lot in American life, there's actually a class war in progress here just beneath [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  the surface. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=663.04s)]
*  When you fire people for not taking an injection, by the way it doesn't work, you're not hurting [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=664.38s)]
*  the private equity people. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=668.52s)]
*  You're hurting blue collar people and maybe that's why they're doing it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=669.88s)]
*  But either way, here's the core point. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=673.84s)]
*  The incentives that we've constructed in this country over a long period of time to be fair, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=676.06s)]
*  but accelerating recently, have a very specific effect. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=680.28s)]
*  Those policies reward people who don't want a job and they punish people who do want a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=684.2s)]
*  job. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=690.16s)]
*  What they do is they degrade work. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=691.22s)]
*  They strip it of its inherent meaning. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=693.56s)]
*  And that's a problem in a country that is running out of things that have inherent meaning. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=695.84s)]
*  They're telling you that your religion means nothing, your patriotism means nothing, your [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=700.26s)]
*  family means nothing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=704.44s)]
*  Now they're telling you your work means nothing? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=706.72s)]
*  What does mean anything? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=709.26s)]
*  And how long can a society continue that doesn't have meaning? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=710.58s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlyzapPINY&t=725.84s)]
