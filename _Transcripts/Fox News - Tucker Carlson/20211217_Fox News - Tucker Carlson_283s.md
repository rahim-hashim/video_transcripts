# Mike Rowe reacts to massive US labor shortage amid low workforce participation rate
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U)
*  Now they're telling you your work means nothing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=0.0s)]
*  What does mean anything? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=3.0s)]
*  And how long can a society continue [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=4.44s)]
*  that doesn't have meaning and that doesn't revere work? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=7.76s)]
*  Well, there's probably no one in a better position [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=13.88s)]
*  to answer that question than Mike Rowe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=15.8s)]
*  Mike Rowe was, of course, and is now once again, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=18.36s)]
*  the host of the acclaimed show Dirty Jobs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=21.5s)]
*  He also started a very successful foundation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=23.1s)]
*  whose job it is and successfully does [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  match willing workers with skilled work. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Mike Rowe joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=29.28s)]
*  Mike, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=31.16s)]
*  So this stuff is super complicated [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=33.36s)]
*  and I hope that we didn't simplify it [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=36.44s)]
*  to the extent that we distorted what's happening. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=38.84s)]
*  There's a lot of it that nobody understands. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=40.68s)]
*  But if you step back, you see the government [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=42.18s)]
*  disincentivizing work, incentivizing idleness, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=46.2s)]
*  sending the message that there's no dignity in work, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=50.92s)]
*  there's no meaning in it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Why bother? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=53.88s)]
*  What effect does that have? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=55.08s)]
*  The effect was encapsulated perfectly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  in everything you just said. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=60.08s)]
*  I mean, not to blow smoke or show too much of my own bias, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  but that's the greatest monologue I've heard you do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=65.8s)]
*  This is no longer a matter of a skills gap [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=70.08s)]
*  or a few million people unemployed [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=74.4s)]
*  and employers frustrated because of the mismatch of skills. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=76.72s)]
*  This is a matter of national security, I think, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=80.36s)]
*  because I think it goes beyond the national security [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  and it goes right to our identity as a people. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  You know, when I started that foundation, MicroWorks, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  13 years ago on Labor Day, we had record high unemployment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=92.88s)]
*  Every single morning I woke up, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=96.74s)]
*  I was shooting Dirty Jobs at the time out in the world [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  and I'd wake up and I'd look at the headlines in the paper [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=100.8s)]
*  and it was always a click up, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  8%, 8 1‚ÅÑ2, nine and so forth and so on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=106.32s)]
*  But everywhere we went on Dirty Jobs, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  we saw help wanted signs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=111.56s)]
*  And it became obvious [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=114.04s)]
*  that something else was happening in the country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=115.24s)]
*  There was some other alternative narrative going on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=117.12s)]
*  regarding opportunity. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=121.82s)]
*  Point is, that was 13 years ago [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=123.6s)]
*  and there were 2.3 open positions, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=125.64s)]
*  2.3 million open positions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=127.92s)]
*  Today, it's 11 million, 11 million. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=129.92s)]
*  12 million people quit their jobs in the fall. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  So you're right to wonder what is going on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=138.0s)]
*  and is there an explanation that goes beyond money? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=140.88s)]
*  And the answer is, yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=145.04s)]
*  It's our whole relationship with work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=147.04s)]
*  So look, it feels very political [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=151.68s)]
*  because everything today is very political. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=158.12s)]
*  The skills gap shouldn't be though. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=159.1s)]
*  Look, one quick point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=161.24s)]
*  All my buddies on the left tell me [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=162.84s)]
*  that the reason for all this opportunity [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=165.5s)]
*  is because employers are fundamentally rapacious and greedy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=167.84s)]
*  And all my buddies on the right tell me [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=171.96s)]
*  all of this opportunity is a function of workers [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  being universally lazy and shiftless. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=177.76s)]
*  They're both painting with too broad a brush. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=181.16s)]
*  The answers, as you said, are a bit more complicated. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=188.36s)]
*  But at its heart is the question of national character. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=189.8s)]
*  Is this a country that respects labor? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=192.44s)]
*  And I don't mean organized labor, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=196.12s)]
*  though maybe that too, but the actual labor, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=197.32s)]
*  the act of creating something that didn't exist before, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=199.28s)]
*  the act of improving something that was broken, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=201.6s)]
*  like do we respect that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think part of the fault in our stars [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=206.12s)]
*  is that we come to resent the very things we rely upon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=209.7s)]
*  So, you know, when the power goes out [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=215.04s)]
*  for three or four days up here where I live, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=217.0s)]
*  people shake their fists at the linemen [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  because they're frustrated. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=220.94s)]
*  But the linemen are trying to get the power back on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=222.24s)]
*  So no, we don't really respect it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=224.66s)]
*  In fact, skilled labor all too often reminds the rest of us [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=226.34s)]
*  of what we're fundamentally lacking. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=230.46s)]
*  The thing that scares me more than anything, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=233.74s)]
*  and the reason I started the foundation when I did, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=236.18s)]
*  was 13 years ago, for every five tradesmen that retired, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=238.5s)]
*  two replaced them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=242.9s)]
*  This is what Abraham Lincoln called a terrible arithmetic. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=245.0s)]
*  And if that was the only thing going on today, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=249.46s)]
*  we'd have cause to be concerned. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=252.22s)]
*  But to your earlier points, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=254.9s)]
*  it's not just the boomers retiring earlier. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  It's a real fear of COVID that's been infecting us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=259.9s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether the fear is justified or not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=265.9s)]
*  It's there. It's real. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  The class thing that you mentioned, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=270.7s)]
*  whether it's true or not, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=272.7s)]
*  we've been told that the reason we're unhappy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=274.42s)]
*  is that our bosses make too much, and so forth and so on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=277.5s)]
*  It's a big, complicated, hairy mess. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR2_ija0e3U&t=281.06s)]
