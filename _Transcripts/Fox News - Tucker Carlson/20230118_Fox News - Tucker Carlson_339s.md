# Tucker: The media doesn't seem interested in this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ)
*  Looks like Sam Bankman Fried [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  committed the largest financial fraud in modern history, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=2.24s)]
*  but he's not in prison. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=5.92s)]
*  He didn't trespass in the Capitol. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=6.96s)]
*  What's interesting is that you are not allowed to know [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=8.56s)]
*  the identity of the two people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=11.36s)]
*  who helped put up Sam Bankman Fried's bond. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=13.24s)]
*  His lawyers even argued in court [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=16.48s)]
*  to keep the names masked to shield them [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  from public criticism. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=21.12s)]
*  Now, the media outlets took a ton of money [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=23.5s)]
*  from Sam Bankman Fried, like Semaphore, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=25.88s)]
*  haven't yet returned the money, that stolen money. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=28.96s)]
*  They don't seem very interested in how this has happened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, we are interested. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=34.36s)]
*  We just finished a documentary, in fact, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=35.58s)]
*  called Scam Bankman Fraud, the Story of FTX. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=37.14s)]
*  It's out on Thursday in Fox Nation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=40.02s)]
*  Here's a preview. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=41.8s)]
*  One of his strategies was to clutter his sentences [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=43.56s)]
*  with technocratic jargon, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  so no one could really understand what he was saying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=47.72s)]
*  Helmier did have a big position open on FTX. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  That position, I think, was very over-collateralized. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=53.64s)]
*  A year ago, there was a total market collapse, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  and specifically a large correlated collapse in its assets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=62.44s)]
*  over the last month. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=66.52s)]
*  I am no cryptocurrency expert, I'm no finance expert, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=67.6s)]
*  but I don't think you answered my question. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=70.68s)]
*  The technocratic jargon is itself [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=72.92s)]
*  part of the smoke screen, too. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=75.36s)]
*  I have a general rule of thumb. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=76.56s)]
*  If you cannot explain it to a 14-year-old, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=78.04s)]
*  that means either you don't understand it yourself, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=80.66s)]
*  or you do understand it, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  and you're trying to confuse the audience [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=85.4s)]
*  for a reason that has to do [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=87.7s)]
*  with your own self-interested game. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=88.86s)]
*  Mr. Bankman Fried has been able to confuse interviewers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=91.7s)]
*  by talking in circles. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=98.68s)]
*  Nothing that SBF has said since the fraud was exposed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=100.66s)]
*  has been coherent even to this sophisticated observer [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=103.9s)]
*  of financial markets, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=107.78s)]
*  and I think that that's not just an accident, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=109.12s)]
*  it is by design, it is another deflection tactic. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=111.36s)]
*  So the man you just saw in that clip [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  is one of the people who acted as a sherpa for us [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  as we tried to understand what was happening [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=123.34s)]
*  with Sam Bankman Fried. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=124.7s)]
*  It's from Vaik Ramaswamy, a frequent guest on the show, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=125.54s)]
*  executive chairman of Strive Asset Management. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=127.66s)]
*  He joins us in studio tonight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=130.22s)]
*  Vaik, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  I loved your point, and I think it's one of the, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=134.26s)]
*  the truest guides to other people's talking. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=136.54s)]
*  But tell me why Sam Bankman Fried [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=139.06s)]
*  is not a fraud? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=142.26s)]
*  I mean, I think he's a fraud. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=143.1s)]
*  Tell me why Sam Bankman Fried seems to be treated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=145.02s)]
*  so much more gently than your average criminal defendant. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=149.34s)]
*  Well, it's because he had [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=152.62s)]
*  the entire deflection tactic set up, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=153.46s)]
*  and it wasn't just the jargon. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=155.72s)]
*  It was the ESG smoke screen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=157.42s)]
*  It was the good guy who was engaged in effective altruism, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=159.54s)]
*  funding Democratic candidates. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=163.5s)]
*  He knew how to play the game [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=165.06s)]
*  to be able to create the appearance [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=166.82s)]
*  that he cared about something other than profit and power [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=168.44s)]
*  when in fact he cared only about more profit [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=170.9s)]
*  and power for himself. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=173.06s)]
*  But the thing that was most striking to me [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=175.52s)]
*  about the Storytucker is not how this is some sort of deviant [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=176.32s)]
*  who's so different than how the rest of Wall Street operates, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=180.28s)]
*  but how familiar his story really is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=183.56s)]
*  It is the same story as we saw back in 2008. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=186.6s)]
*  I think there are a lot of similarities. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=189.84s)]
*  It's gonna make a lot of people mad to hear this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of similarities [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  to what those ESG promoting financial institutions do today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=194.12s)]
*  Cause what did SBF do? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  He took client funds without their permission [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=198.78s)]
*  and used it to advance his agenda without telling him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=201.4s)]
*  Guess what the largest financial institutions [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=205.04s)]
*  in the world are doing today? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=207.0s)]
*  They're using somebody else's money [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=208.62s)]
*  without their permission to advance their own agendas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=210.08s)]
*  And so what I find most fascinating about the story [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=213.52s)]
*  isn't this one guy with curly hair who was 30 years old [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=215.56s)]
*  that was worth a lot of money and now isn't. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=217.96s)]
*  That's just a detail. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=219.84s)]
*  I think it's an interesting moment [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=221.08s)]
*  for everyone to look in the mirror [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=222.56s)]
*  who's in Wall Street and everywhere else [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=224.32s)]
*  and ask themselves how dissimilar his story really is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  to what even mainstream actors in financial markets [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=229.6s)]
*  have been doing since 2008. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=231.96s)]
*  It's a wise point. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=233.0s)]
*  I mean, these are people who are motivated [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=233.84s)]
*  by a lot of things, but one of them is the desire [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=235.92s)]
*  to accumulate as much money as possible. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=237.4s)]
*  We know that it's fine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=238.76s)]
*  But we have regulators who are supposed to keep that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=239.92s)]
*  within the bounds like Gary Gensler. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=241.72s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=243.32s)]
*  They're busy focused on advancing those same agendas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Why are they propagating ESG disclosure rules [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=248.84s)]
*  when in fact they should be focused [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=252.2s)]
*  on preventing people from losing money? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=253.68s)]
*  You would think this was an objective. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=256.56s)]
*  And the irony is they're gonna use this as a catalyst [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=258.48s)]
*  to say, well, now we need to have greater purview [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=260.52s)]
*  over regulating cryptocurrencies or whatever. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=263.0s)]
*  When in fact, this is just a managerial class [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=265.32s)]
*  that's advancing a political agenda. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=267.6s)]
*  And the more you advance a political agenda, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=269.48s)]
*  the less you're doing the job [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=271.76s)]
*  that you're actually supposed to do. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=273.0s)]
*  And you know it well, Tucker, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=275.0s)]
*  that is the story of the administrative state, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=275.88s)]
*  the SEC included, as we know it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=277.6s)]
*  So just really quick, if it is true [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=279.6s)]
*  that what Sam Bankman Fried did is not so different [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=282.0s)]
*  from what a lot of people are doing right now, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=284.4s)]
*  are you concerned about the stability [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=285.92s)]
*  of our financial system? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=288.2s)]
*  So look, I've had concerns dating back to 2008. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=289.92s)]
*  The thing that we didn't let happen in this country, Tucker, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=292.96s)]
*  was when those banks actually erred back then, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=295.32s)]
*  we should have let them fall [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=298.12s)]
*  and actually teach this system its lesson. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=299.64s)]
*  Instead, the lesson we taught was the worse you act, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=302.24s)]
*  the more likely you are to get bailed out by the system. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSHicAqBMQ&t=305.15999999999997s)]
