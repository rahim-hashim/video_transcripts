# 'Detransitioned' Navy SEAL: They hide the fact that I exist
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M)
*  Chris Beck is a name you may recognize. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a highly decorated Navy SEAL. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=1.8s)]
*  A decade ago, he became famous because he announced [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=3.64s)]
*  he was transitioning, becoming a woman, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=5.96s)]
*  calling himself Kristen Beck. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=8.1s)]
*  CNN made a film about him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=9.84s)]
*  And in that film, Chris Beck, at the time, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=11.8s)]
*  identifying as a woman, admitted that he wasn't sure [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=13.6s)]
*  what the term transgender meant. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=16.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=17.64s)]
*  It's hard to explain. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=18.6s)]
*  People ask me about that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=20.14s)]
*  They say, I don't really understand transgender. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=21.44s)]
*  And you know, can you explain it to me? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=23.36s)]
*  And the only thing I can tell them is, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=25.36s)]
*  I don't really know what transgender is either. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=30.64s)]
*  I mean, I know what it is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=31.48s)]
*  It's this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=32.64s)]
*  But I don't know where it comes from or why. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=33.96s)]
*  So Chris Beck has had 10 years to think about this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=38.2s)]
*  And he looks back and believes and has said [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=40.92s)]
*  that the whole process of transitioning, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=43.04s)]
*  quote, destroyed his life. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  In an interview with Robbie Starbuck, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=47.44s)]
*  Beck said this, quote, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=49.0s)]
*  everything that happened to me for the last 10 years [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=49.92s)]
*  destroyed my life. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  I destroyed my life. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=53.44s)]
*  I'm not a victim. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=54.44s)]
*  I did this to myself. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=55.44s)]
*  But I had help. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=57.18s)]
*  Chris Beck joins us now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=58.86s)]
*  Chris, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=60.38s)]
*  It's a poignant story and deserves, I think, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=63.26s)]
*  a much longer treatment than we're about to give it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=64.98s)]
*  But when you say you had help, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=66.58s)]
*  what did you mean by that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=68.14s)]
*  Well, the transgender originally started out [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=70.78s)]
*  as pretty basic and very rare. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=74.22s)]
*  And now it's kind of morphed into an ideology. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=76.78s)]
*  And that's what I'm kind of speaking out about. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=79.78s)]
*  Speaking about the ideology, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=81.94s)]
*  I'm not talking about the people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=82.94s)]
*  Now there's a lot of transgender people, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=84.3s)]
*  great folks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=85.94s)]
*  But the ideology is what I'm talking about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=87.86s)]
*  It's becoming something where it's being pushed in schools [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=89.3s)]
*  and young teenagers are having surgeries [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  because they're saying they're transgender. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=96.74s)]
*  It's an affirmation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=98.3s)]
*  Once a teenager walks into an office, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=99.5s)]
*  even if the parents are saying no, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=101.34s)]
*  that doctor can override that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=103.14s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=105.22s)]
*  So then you also just to say to ideology [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=106.42s)]
*  and what's going on, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  to prove it is like what's happening to me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=109.62s)]
*  As soon as I started speaking out [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=112.1s)]
*  and saying that I think these teenagers need more time, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=113.78s)]
*  they also need to reclassify transgender [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=117.7s)]
*  as gender dysphoria. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=119.78s)]
*  It used to be in the psychologist manual [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=121.1s)]
*  for mental health issues. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=124.62s)]
*  Now they've gotten rid of that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=126.82s)]
*  And now as soon as somebody goes in there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=128.5s)]
*  and says anything even close to transgender, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=130.06s)]
*  you're basically level transgender [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=132.18s)]
*  and you start pushing your surgery. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=133.7s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to stop. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=135.3s)]
*  There's a lot of great people out there [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=136.78s)]
*  who are transgender and not transgender everything. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=138.46s)]
*  What I'm talking about when I talk about CNN [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=140.7s)]
*  is that they take soundbites, they take something [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=142.78s)]
*  and they talk about it one-sided. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  They talk about all the pros of transgender. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=147.05999999999997s)]
*  Now I'm on Fox, didn't wanna do this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  But now on Fox, I don't want it to happen the opposite way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=151.66s)]
*  What we need to do is take the politics out of this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=154.98s)]
*  We wanna take the emotions out of this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=157.42s)]
*  And let's look at it as a medical team. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  Let's look at it through a lot different scope. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=161.42s)]
*  I don't want this to be political [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=163.54s)]
*  and I don't want transgender people to be harmed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=165.06s)]
*  But if you're doing this to kids, that's wrong. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=167.38s)]
*  I have a Navy SEAL friend of mine, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  a very good friend of mine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  He has a daughter. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  The daughter was a tomboy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=174.54s)]
*  You could see it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=175.94s)]
*  She was a happy tomboy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=176.78s)]
*  She had double mastectomy at 16 years old. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=178.5s)]
*  A Navy SEAL friend of mine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  Now this person is 20, I think. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=184.14s)]
*  And who knows what's gonna happen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=186.62s)]
*  But they also start doing them on hormone blockers [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=188.38s)]
*  and all kinds of other hormone things, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=190.7s)]
*  puberty blockers, everything else. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=192.42s)]
*  This sterilizes these kids. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=194.14s)]
*  So we're gonna have all these children [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=196.34s)]
*  in five or 10 years who are being told [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=198.18s)]
*  one side of this story and they're going, well, that's me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=200.7s)]
*  Because they're not being told stories like mine [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=205.38s)]
*  and not being told stories like so many other people [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=206.18s)]
*  who have B transitions. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=208.86s)]
*  They hide the fact that I even exist. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  They also say that I hate transgender people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=213.5s)]
*  I don't hate transgender people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=215.66s)]
*  There's a lot of my friends. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=217.3s)]
*  What I care about is people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=218.78s)]
*  I want people to slow down. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=220.66s)]
*  I want these doctors to see what they're doing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=222.34s)]
*  In psychology, take a look at gender dysphoria. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=224.5s)]
*  Take a look at autogonophilia. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=227.46s)]
*  Take a look at body dysphoric disorder. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=229.34s)]
*  There's a myriad of things you can look at, sorry, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=232.3s)]
*  that we really have to start taking a look at. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  So what I'm telling is the medical industry and parents, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  y'all need to wake up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  Y'all need to know that there's a lot of information [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  out there that's being hidden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=245.62s)]
*  I don't want you to search for that information. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=247.18s)]
*  If you're a teenager, look at the stories like Chloe Cole. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=249.22000000000003s)]
*  She's 18 or 19 now, but I think she had a double mastectomy [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  at like 14 or 15 years old. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=257.5s)]
*  Look up that name, Chloe Cole. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=259.5s)]
*  She's out here speaking about it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=261.38s)]
*  because she's an adult now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=262.86s)]
*  So she's getting all this done as a teenager. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=264.74s)]
*  Where does that put the medical industry? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=267.46s)]
*  She was not a consenting adult [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=269.34s)]
*  and she got life altering surgery. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=271.58s)]
*  She got basically castrated as a teenager [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=273.14s)]
*  with all these drugs and all the stuff they're giving them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=277.26s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  All I'm speaking out about is that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=281.06s)]
*  I want people to take a look at both sides. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=283.7s)]
*  I want you to see the CNN side [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=286.98s)]
*  and I want you to see the Fox side. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=288.82s)]
*  Right now, this is not political. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=290.94s)]
*  I don't want to be political. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  I don't want to be emotional. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't want this to turn into something bigger than it is. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=295.78s)]
*  This should not be news. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=298.46s)]
*  If doctors would be honest and give the entire story, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=300.5s)]
*  then I wouldn't even be on here right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=304.46s)]
*  I would have gone about my life quietly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  I would have been on my farm. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  You never would have heard from me. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=309.82s)]
*  Tucker, I don't want to talk back to you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to be on here. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  But we have to be here [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=314.46s)]
*  because nobody is standing up for these kids. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=316.78s)]
*  Now, if there's a bunch of kids that are transgender [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=319.26s)]
*  and they grow up and they'd be happy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=320.98s)]
*  and they're 80 years old and they're still happy, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=322.46s)]
*  you know, that's great. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=324.46s)]
*  But there's a lot of kids who are getting caught up [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=325.94s)]
*  in this huge tidal wave of popular transgender culture, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=327.98s)]
*  popular transgender ideology, and that is wrong. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=332.38s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=336.3s)]
*  What you've just expressed is the opposite of hate. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=339.14s)]
*  It's measured and thoughtful and humane [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=341.7s)]
*  and born of your own experience [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=344.26s)]
*  and clearly motivated by good faith. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  And I hope it's seen by everyone [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=347.94s)]
*  because it's not political. You're absolutely right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=349.98s)]
*  Chris Beck, I appreciate your thinking that through [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=351.38s)]
*  and sharing with us what you've learned [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=354.1s)]
*  and what you hope for the country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=355.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rIyfChY9M&t=356.42s)]
