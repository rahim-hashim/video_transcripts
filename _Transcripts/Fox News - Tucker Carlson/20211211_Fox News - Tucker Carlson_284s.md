# These were the details that proved Jussie Smollett's guilt: Attorney
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI)
*  On February 14, 2019, Valentine's Day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=0.0s)]
*  Jussie Smollett sat down for an interview [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  with the most credulous person, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=5.2s)]
*  and also the best paid person on television, Robert Roberts, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=6.7s)]
*  to describe his fake hate crime. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=10.44s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=11.8s)]
*  As I was crossing the intersection, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=12.84s)]
*  I heard, Empire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=14.68s)]
*  And I don't answer to Empire. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  My name ain't Empire. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=19.44s)]
*  And I didn't answer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=22.64s)]
*  I kept walking, and then I heard, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=23.64s)]
*  F***, Empire, n***a. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=26.48s)]
*  So I turned around and I said, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=28.18s)]
*  the f*** did you just say to me? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=29.54s)]
*  And I see the attacker masked. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=30.78s)]
*  And he said, this MAGA country n***a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=37.18s)]
*  punches me right in the face. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=41.94s)]
*  I was just jumped. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=43.28s)]
*  And then I looked down and I see [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=44.78s)]
*  that there's a rope around my neck. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=46.34s)]
*  If there's a rope around my neck in downtown Chicago [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=48.84s)]
*  at two in the morning and away back from the subway [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=50.94s)]
*  because I don't like Donald Trump, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=52.54s)]
*  happens a lot in Chicago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=54.82s)]
*  So as he was giving that interview [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=56.28s)]
*  and Robin Roberts was nodding, oh, Jussie, yes, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=57.94s)]
*  the people who beat him up were in custody in Chicago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=60.72s)]
*  They're called the Ascenderio brothers, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=63.72s)]
*  they're from Nigeria, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=65.18s)]
*  and they were giving police the evidence [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=66.02s)]
*  that ultimately led to the convictions we just saw. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=67.32s)]
*  Now Smollett's lawyer is promising [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=69.84s)]
*  that conviction will be overturned. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=71.72s)]
*  We thought it'd be interesting to hear [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=73.28s)]
*  from the attorney for the Ascenderio brothers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=74.52s)]
*  Her name is Gloria Rodriguez, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=76.68s)]
*  and we are very glad to have her join us tonight. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=77.84s)]
*  Gloria, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=80.82s)]
*  So what do your clients think of all of this? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=83.42s)]
*  Oh my goodness, Tucker. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=85.76s)]
*  Well, let me just say first and foremost [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  that when you first had me on, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=89.28s)]
*  it was pretty early on after this, you know, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=91.42s)]
*  hoax came on, and I came back on your show first [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=94.36s)]
*  because you promised me that you would follow [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=97.78s)]
*  this story correctly and portray it correctly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=100.58000000000001s)]
*  And true to your word, you did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=102.86s)]
*  And you've gotten it right since day one on this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=105.12s)]
*  So I'm happy to be back and here talking to you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=107.36s)]
*  about what happened, and you and I both knew [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=112.02s)]
*  what really happened, and the Ascenderio brothers [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=114.82s)]
*  are very thrilled and grateful that the jury, you know, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=117.6s)]
*  didn't buy the fake act. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=122.46s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, it must have been bewildering [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  for them since they were there, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  and they knew exactly what happened [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=129.7s)]
*  to hear Jussie Smollett describe this fantasy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=131.46s)]
*  with a straight face. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=135.46s)]
*  I mean, what kind of person could do that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=136.5s)]
*  You know, it's your right to take the stand [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=140.22s)]
*  if you're the defendant. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  It carries obvious risks with it, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=144.62s)]
*  but it's not your right to lie to the jury. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=147.02s)]
*  You don't have the right to make up your own set of facts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=149.8s)]
*  And one of the OSP, the Office of Special Prosecutors, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=152.46s)]
*  my favorite part of this trial was watching Sam Mendenhall. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=156.96s)]
*  What an amazing attorney from that team. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=160.7s)]
*  He kept saying in his closing remarks, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=163.1s)]
*  you're entitled to your own opinions, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=165.66s)]
*  you're not entitled to your own facts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  And that's what Mr. Smollett kept trying to do [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=169.94s)]
*  is just change the facts. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=172.84s)]
*  And as much as he tried to sell that story, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  it just didn't make any sense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  And you have to consider, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=181.5s)]
*  the Ascenderio brothers testified for two days. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  They were not, you know, they didn't have any way [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  of knowing the testimony of the other, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=188.66s)]
*  and they went into significant details about what went on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=190.84s)]
*  And all of this was corroborated by the police. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=196.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=200.88s)]
*  But I wonder though, I mean, there's so much lying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=201.84s)]
*  just in our society, if I can just say, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  and you begin to think, well, maybe people believe it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=206.52s)]
*  You don't know whether they believe it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=208.36s)]
*  And here you have a jury, I don't know who was on it, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=209.36s)]
*  but just like normal Americans. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  And I did wonder like, will they believe this stuff? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=213.08s)]
*  Were you worried at all about the outcome? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  No, I wasn't worried about the outcome. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=218.94s)]
*  I mean, sorry to say that so bluntly. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=221.36s)]
*  Oh, I love it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=224.28s)]
*  You know, there are juries that are unpredictable at times, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=225.12s)]
*  but this is one of those cases, Tucker, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=229.12s)]
*  and I know you covered this on your show, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=231.74s)]
*  so I won't belabor it, but there was a mountain of evidence [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=233.52s)]
*  to show that every detail that the Ascenderio brothers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  were saying was corroborated. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=241.88s)]
*  They said, for instance, that they did a dry run [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=244.1s)]
*  on that Saturday before the event, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  and the police were able to track down Jessie's car. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=250.28s)]
*  And so what plausible, viable theory could Jessie give [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  for all those exact things? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  It's just nothing he said was cohesive or made sense. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=261.2s)]
*  Right, I know, but for those of us who so desperately [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  wanna believe in our justice system, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  above all systems in this country, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  this was a thrilling result, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=271.02s)]
*  because it was reality-based, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  and I love that you never doubted it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  It's great to see you again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=277.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=278.98s)]
*  Great to be on, and feliz navidad. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=279.82s)]
*  Amen, feliz navidad. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZFgRGQhLI&t=282.48s)]
