# Cryptocurrency exchange founder was the cash cow of the left: Miranda Devine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=0.0s)]
*  The major cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which is run by Sam Bankman Fried, has collapsed [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=1.0s)]
*  and declared bankruptcy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=6.76s)]
*  What actually happened is pretty complicated. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=8.68s)]
*  Later in the week, Tucker is going to have a full investigation on this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=11.4s)]
*  But here's what we know for sure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=15.52s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried was one of the top donors of the Democratic Party this year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=17.68s)]
*  In fact, he was the second largest donor to Democrats, second only to George Soros. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=20.88s)]
*  That money bought Bankman Fried a lot of access. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=26.6s)]
*  The Washington Free Beacon reports that just six months ago, Bankman Fried was at the White [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=30.32s)]
*  House consulting on cryptocurrency regulation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=34.56s)]
*  At the same time, Bankman Fried was pretending to be a kind of Robin Hood figure who didn't [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=37.24s)]
*  care at all about money. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  He shot this promotional video, for example. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=44.32s)]
*  The guy you see next to me is the most generous billionaire in the world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=47.08s)]
*  And I found him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=51.88s)]
*  Hi, my name is Sam. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=52.88s)]
*  And this is my story. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=54.78s)]
*  This year, this 29-year-old guy donated $50 million. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  Next year, he's planning to donate $500 million a year. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=62.2s)]
*  And next decade, he will probably give away more than $10 billion. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=67.56s)]
*  The amount of good that you can do for the future of the world is really large. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=76.28s)]
*  And it's way more than you can do to actually make yourself happy with anything like that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=80.68s)]
*  And he is funding everything you can think of. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Global warming. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=90.52s)]
*  It's one of the biggest problems that we have to tackle together as a world. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=91.52s)]
*  COVID-19 preparedness. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=95.52s)]
*  We have to be ready for the next pandemic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=97.72s)]
*  There's a lot of speculation right now about the connections between FTX and Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=100.96s)]
*  It turns out that FTX set up a website for users to send cash to Ukraine's central bank. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=106.64s)]
*  This led to speculation that the US government might have sent taxpayer money to Ukraine, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=111.96s)]
*  which then ended up at FTX and ultimately to Democrats. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=116.88s)]
*  Now to unpack what we know for sure, we're joined by Miranda Devine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=120.8s)]
*  She's a columnist at the New York Post. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for joining us, Miranda. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=130.68s)]
*  Tell us what's going on here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=131.68s)]
*  Well, look, what we know is that this is a cryptocurrency, is really a pretty unregulated industry. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=134.68s)]
*  It's something that Warren Buffett says is an industry of charlatans. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=142.88s)]
*  And he says it's selling worthless material. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=147.68s)]
*  It's basically digital currency, doesn't exist. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=152.8s)]
*  And we have this kid who lives a very bizarre lifestyle in the tax haven of the Bahamas, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=157.2s)]
*  sleeps on his bean bag when he isn't living in a 10-person polycule, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  which I'm told is like a throuple, a sort of sexual romantic relationship with a number of people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=170.04s)]
*  And he somehow became the youngest billionaire in the world, was worth up to $20 billion at one point. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  And he was shuffling this sort of pretend money around the place and was being fated on the cover of Fortune and Forbes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=184.44s)]
*  As you say, he was the second biggest donor to the Democrats for the midterms. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=193.6s)]
*  And he also donated $10 million to Joe Biden in 2020 to become president. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=199.04s)]
*  He frequently went to the White House and was really in the bosom of the left. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=204.28s)]
*  And as you see, he was indulging in all sorts of woke causes, including Ukraine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  And why on earth, you know, the American taxpayer is funneling tens of billions of dollars over to Ukraine so that they can fight Russia? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=215.72s)]
*  And why on earth they would be involved, the Ukrainian government, with this now collapsed cryptocurrency exchange? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=227.12s)]
*  We need to know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=235.28s)]
*  I'm sure that when the bankruptcy trustees come out with all their information, we'll find out a little more. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  But it's not enough for the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine to just scoff at questions and call them conspiracy theories. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=243.28s)]
*  Why on earth was a country at war dabbling with cryptocurrency, which everybody knows is shady? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Miranda. There are so many questions here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=261.96s)]
*  I'm looking forward to seeing Tucker's piece on this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=264.16s)]
*  Certainly a lot of eyebrows raised. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=266.6s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Chelsea. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej1JG_UZVuM&t=271.68s)]
