# Biden could ease inflation by admitting this mistake: Murdock
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24)
*  Droy Murdoch is a contributing editor to National Review Online. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=0.0s)]
*  We are delighted to have him join us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  My favorite part was when Corrine Jean-Pierre, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=5.84s)]
*  and I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name correctly, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=8.34s)]
*  I don't want to be racist, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=9.78s)]
*  he said, I'd like to change the subject for a minute [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=11.38s)]
*  and then called someone else racist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=14.22s)]
*  That seems like the only subject, really. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=15.92s)]
*  It seems like the only one. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=18.02s)]
*  Thank you for your act of racism [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=19.18s)]
*  and having me here tonight, Tucker, I might say. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=20.26s)]
*  But, yeah, look, when you have nothing else to talk about, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=23.92s)]
*  you don't have any answers, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=26.2s)]
*  you don't have any actual solutions that might work, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=27.2s)]
*  you scream racism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=28.7s)]
*  Another thing that screaming racism does, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  it's a very polite or maybe a somewhat more polite way [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=32.14s)]
*  of saying, shut the hell up. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=35.54s)]
*  They don't want the conversation, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=37.4s)]
*  they don't want the tough questions, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=38.4s)]
*  they don't want anything else [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=39.98s)]
*  in terms of constructive criticism. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=41.3s)]
*  So we scream racism that's designed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=42.58s)]
*  not to advance the conversation, but to shut it down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=44.12s)]
*  And to go back to what you were saying [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=46.62s)]
*  in your excellent monologue earlier about Venezuela, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  I happened to visit Venezuela a couple times [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=49.68s)]
*  in the late 90s, early zeros, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=51.36s)]
*  and yes, it was a prosperous place, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  fun place, beautiful place, and it's a total wreck. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=54.82s)]
*  And in order to keep us from turning into that country, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  which we seem to be with the empty store shelves, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=60.02s)]
*  the climbing prices, baby formula shortage, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  babies in the hospital because of this formula shortage, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=66.16s)]
*  unbelievable, Joe Biden could fix a lot of problems, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=68.5s)]
*  inflation, his political woes, which are terrible, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=71.7s)]
*  the political standing for the Democrat party, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=74.4s)]
*  by saying, look, I made a big mistake [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=76.16s)]
*  by shutting down the Keystone pipeline, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=77.56s)]
*  we need to increase domestic oil production, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=79.16s)]
*  begin to start bringing energy prices down, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=81.4s)]
*  if energy prices start to come down, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  the rest of the price curve would come down, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=84.9s)]
*  and inflation would ease to a degree, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=86.42s)]
*  and I think if people at least saw inflation going down, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=87.86s)]
*  confidence would improve, optimism would increase, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=90.62s)]
*  and people would start feeling a lot better. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  But right now, every time I turn on the TV, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  gas prices are going up and away, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  every day a higher record price for gas and diesel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Now there's talk about diesel shortages coming, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=102.44s)]
*  and as you say, this place in less than a year and a half, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=104.5s)]
*  in the 15, 16 months, is looking a lot more like, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=106.84s)]
*  it's beginning to look a lot more like Venezuela [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  than anything you and I or anybody ever could imagine. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=112.14000000000001s)]
*  The concern is not just poverty, but radicalism. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=114.6s)]
*  I mean, no one's getting more moderate, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  so refusing to address people's legitimate concerns, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=119.08s)]
*  calling them racist if they ask honest questions, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=122.24s)]
*  all of that makes people more radical over time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Are you worried that the country could, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=127.38s)]
*  you can kind of feel it moving underneath their feet here? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=129.88s)]
*  And that's what I think a lot of people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  on the far, far left want. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=134.32s)]
*  I think one of the greatest political slogans [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=135.56s)]
*  was that of Vladimir Lenin before the Russian Revolution. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=137.0s)]
*  It was very simple, four words, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=140.0s)]
*  the worse, the better, the worse, the better. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=141.92s)]
*  The worse the conditions were, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=144.34s)]
*  more people would be radicalized and say, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  look, we've had it with the Tsar, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  maybe we should bring Lenin in, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=148.28s)]
*  maybe he can turn things around. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  I think there's some people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=150.5s)]
*  who want total utter chaos in society. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=151.34s)]
*  I have a piece in the American Spectator [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=153.3s)]
*  about the Democrat Party, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  and how they have nothing but terrible ideas, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=156.06s)]
*  awful solutions, and some of the people [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  in the far left Democrat Party today, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=159.78s)]
*  I think want exactly that kind of chaos, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  and ultimately a revolutionary type situation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  The worse, the better, boy, that is chilling. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=165.94s)]
*  Droid Murdoch, thank you so much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=168.46s)]
*  Tucker, great to see you, thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQ8w4jYT24&t=169.70000000000002s)]
