# Kash Patel says he was intentionally named in FBI affidavit for 'political purposes'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0)
*  So most of the DOJ's search warrant affidavit, which supposedly justifies the completely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=0.0s)]
*  indefensible FBI raid in Mar-a-Lago, has been redacted because you don't have clearance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=7.04s)]
*  You can't see it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=11.56s)]
*  But one name that is prominently featured, not redacted, is that of Cash Patel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=12.6s)]
*  He's a former chief of staff at DOD from the last administration. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  So immediately after the affidavit was released with his name unredacted, Peter Strzok, maybe [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=20.6s)]
*  the most famous FBI agent in modern history, tweeted this, directed at Cash Patel, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=27.18s)]
*  were quoting, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=32.7s)]
*  Never great to see your unredacted name in a search warrant affidavit. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=33.7s)]
*  Get a great effing criminal defense lawyer, you're going to need it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=37.74s)]
*  So here you have permanent Washington threatening someone on Twitter. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=41.86s)]
*  But that's totally cool because orange man bad, like what? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=46.42s)]
*  So we thought we would like to speak to Cash Patel himself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  He's president of the Cash Foundation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=53.14s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=54.9s)]
*  Cash Patel, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=55.9s)]
*  If I were you, I hate to say this to you, but I would be very concerned about a tweet [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=58.58s)]
*  like that from a lunatic like Peter Strzok. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=63.5s)]
*  Well, you know, Tucker, as a former national security prosecutor and as the lead investigator [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=65.58s)]
*  for Russiagate, my investigation that I ran with Devin Nunes is the reason Peter Strzok [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=71.5s)]
*  got fired along with 16 other FBI officials, including Andy McCabe, Lisa Page, Comey, and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=76.3s)]
*  the like. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=81.94s)]
*  Corrupt Cabal is back being escorted out the door, as you just reported on Friday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=82.98s)]
*  So the corruption continues and their bias and their hypocrisy knows no bounds. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=87.42s)]
*  But of course, they're shameless. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=91.66s)]
*  As a former national security prosecutor and Peter Strzok as a counterintelligence head [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  agent knows that American citizens names and search warrants are supposed to be redacted. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=96.9s)]
*  This DOJ with the same leadership that authorized the Russiagate is now back in charge, had [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=102.5s)]
*  gone in to intentionally lift the redaction of just my name and then redact the next seven [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=107.42s)]
*  consecutive pages. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=112.74s)]
*  It was totally for political purposes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=114.38s)]
*  They don't care about the threats to my life, the racist message and the hatred I see every [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=116.5s)]
*  day now because they are publicly advertising for me to fail, to go to jail and to be harmed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=121.1s)]
*  And here's another thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=127.74s)]
*  The FBI did this after a 10-month investigation into death threats from the January 6 subpoena [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=128.74s)]
*  committee on me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=133.62s)]
*  And on Friday, the same day they issued the affidavit is the same day they ended the investigation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  saying even though they had credible evidence, we could go no further. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=140.34s)]
*  It's just beggars belief. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=145.22s)]
*  So one of the highest ranking officials at the FBI is threatening you on Twitter. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=146.66s)]
*  Where's the current FBI director to call Peter Strzok and say, hey, you can't do that because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=153.34s)]
*  you eliminate all public confidence in this agency when you do? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  Well the current FBI director, Chris Ray, was the FBI director when we ran the Russiagate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=163.46s)]
*  And he had the opportunity then to expose all the corruption at the FBI and he failed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=168.3s)]
*  and he's been covering up since. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=172.34s)]
*  Look, we said since the beginning, we got out 60 percent of the documents for the Russiagate [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=173.74s)]
*  investigation, 40 percent remained. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=177.86s)]
*  President Trump declassified those specific documents and this entire raid on his house, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=180.18s)]
*  I believe, was to prevent the disclosure now that the government gangsters are back in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=185.06s)]
*  charge of their corrupt activities from Russiagate on down because now that they have an open [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=189.38000000000002s)]
*  FBI counterintelligence investigation, they will shield any release of documents because [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  they will say we have an open investigation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=200.1s)]
*  Congress has a lot of work to do and I'm glad whistleblowers are coming forward. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  They need to be doing so in droves. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=205.14s)]
*  This behavior is just so over the top. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  The next time a prominent critic of the FBI has kitty porn found on his laptop or fentanyl [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=210.05999999999997s)]
*  in his car, I don't think anyone's going to believe it's real. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  That's how corrupt it seems to me and we just wish you absolutely the best, Kash Patel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=219.14s)]
*  You have a right, a constitutional right, to give your views in public without being [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=223.54s)]
*  threatened. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=226.78s)]
*  So thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOY8Cz2qq_0&t=227.78s)]
