# Former trans teen speaks out on lawsuit over gender affirming surgery
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc)
*  Hospitals that abuse children that mutilate their genitals in the name of trans ideology are finally, blessedly, being shut down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=0.0s)]
*  Vanderbilt, for example, closed its youth gender clinic after the Daily Wire exposed them. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=7.0s)]
*  In Tavistock, in Great Britain, the government closed a gender reassignment clinic after they got sued by thousands of parents. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=12.0s)]
*  So litigation stops mutilation. And these kinds of closures are about to become more common. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=18.0s)]
*  Our friend Harmeet Dhillon is now representing a young woman called Chloe Cole, a biological woman who was told she could become a man surgically. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=25.0s)]
*  Now Harmeet and Cole are suing the doctors who did this to her. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=32.0s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon is the chairman of the Republican National Lawyers Association and she's joined by Chloe Cole. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=36.0s)]
*  Thank you both so much for coming on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=41.0s)]
*  Chloe, first to you, tell us why you're suing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=44.0s)]
*  So I'm, it's a medical malpractice case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=49.0s)]
*  I want to hold the adults who put me in harm's way accountable because, I mean, what happened to me is horrible, but it's also, it didn't only happen to me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=56.0s)]
*  That's the worst part. It's happening to children all over the U.S., all over the, all over the, all over the West and it's spreading all over the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=66.0s)]
*  And I want to be able to create a precedent for other people who have been in my situation to find justice themselves. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=73.0s)]
*  How old were you when you were told by a doctor that you could become a different sex? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=81.0s)]
*  I was 12. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=88.0s)]
*  You were 12 years old. And did you, I mean, I assume at 12 you believe what a doctor tells you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=90.0s)]
*  And my parents trusted them as well. They, my parents, they started referring, I, I was 12 years old when I first expressed to them that I had distress with my gender, with being female, and that I wanted to transition to male. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=99.0s)]
*  And they were concerned and they wanted what was best for me, but they weren't really sure what to do with me, so they sought professional help. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=116.0s)]
*  And from then on, I was basically affirmed in my gender identity without any questioning from any medical professionals, and they pushed transitioning as the way to treat gender dysphoria. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=126.0s)]
*  It's so, it's so upsetting. It's hard even to ask questions, but I'll ask you one more. They committed surgery on you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=139.0s)]
*  Yes. When I was 15 years old, I had a double mastectomy. They removed both of my breasts, and I will never have them back. I will, as an adult, I never will be able to breastfeed whatever children I will have. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=146.0s)]
*  I don't even know if, because I was put on puberty blockers and testosterone at only 13 years old, I don't know if I'll even be able to conceive a child naturally. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=160.0s)]
*  How do you feel about that now? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=171.0s)]
*  Because I made an adult decision as a child. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=172.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable this could happen in America. How old are you now and how do you feel about what they did to you? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=175.0s)]
*  I'm 18 years old now, and I'm, quite frankly, I am devastated with what has happened to me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=181.0s)]
*  I, it's been very hard to cope with the loss of my breasts, and it's affected other areas of my health as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=188.0s)]
*  I'm really not sure about the overall picture of my reproductive health, and I've been, the treatments have made me very, very sickly, actually. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=202.0s)]
*  Harmony, just in 10 seconds, how can this be legal? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=215.0s)]
*  Well, Tucker, the Center for American Liberty, which is representing Chloe here, believes it is illegal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=219.0s)]
*  Our website at LibertyCenter.org has the letter, very detailed letter that details all of the medical symptoms that Chloe has and the medical malpractice and, frankly, mutilation that was perpetrated by these medical professionals. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=226.0s)]
*  We intend to stop it, and we want to hear from other people who have had these problems as well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=240.0s)]
*  We intend to shut these barbaric and unnatural practices down. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=244.0s)]
*  God bless you for doing that. I mean it. Thank you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=248.0s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon, Chloe Cole, I'm so sorry. Thanks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=251.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=254.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cdcZ3_wDc&t=255.0s)]
