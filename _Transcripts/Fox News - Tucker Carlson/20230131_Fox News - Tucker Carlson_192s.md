# Cigar lover sounds off on proposed 95% cigar tax
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA)
*  Taxes aren't just a way to raise money for the state, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=0.0s)]
*  they're an instrument of social control. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=1.84s)]
*  If you don't like something, you tax it into extinction. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=3.2s)]
*  So with that in mind, you should know [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=5.96s)]
*  that the state of New York currently imposes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=7.12s)]
*  a 75% tax on cigars, because they're so dangerous. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=8.76s)]
*  Number of Americans killed each year by cigars? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=13.4s)]
*  Not many, but a new tax would be increased [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=16.52s)]
*  under a law that looks like it's gonna pass [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=21.32s)]
*  to 95% on cigars in the state of New York. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=23.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, the tax on cannabis in New York is 13%. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=27.76s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=33.24s)]
*  Well, Lou Gialmino is a criminal defense attorney [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=34.64s)]
*  on Staten Island and a cigar aficionado, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=37.0s)]
*  and so we're inviting him tonight to explain the disparity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=41.0s)]
*  So you're a defense lawyer, you're very familiar [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=44.68s)]
*  with disparities, powder and crack cocaine and the rest. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Why the disparity in taxes? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=50.16s)]
*  95% for cigars, which do not hurt you, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=51.84s)]
*  and 13% on weed, which increases your chance [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=55.64s)]
*  of getting schizophrenia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=58.4s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=59.36s)]
*  Tucker, thanks for having me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=62.28s)]
*  As you know, I am a cigar smoker, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=63.52s)]
*  and I guess that's why you had me on tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=65.04s)]
*  You know, it seems like the government will not be happy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=67.4s)]
*  unless they have us all eating kale, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=71.36s)]
*  drinking carrot juice and smoking weed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=73.56s)]
*  All right, they're not happy with a nice, good cigar. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=76.36s)]
*  I mean, to tax something at 95% is absurd. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=79.44s)]
*  They wanna tax it into extinction, like you said. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=82.6s)]
*  But why? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=85.24s)]
*  You know who gets hurt here, Tucker? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  The mom and pop cigar shop down at the corner. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=88.0s)]
*  That's who gets hurt here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  Not the rich people, because you know where they're buying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=93.44s)]
*  their cigars? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=96.08s)]
*  On the illegal market, the Cubans on the illegal market. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=97.24s)]
*  They get their full boxes and they're not taxed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=100.28s)]
*  But the average Joe that wants to enjoy a nice cigar [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  on his porch at night with a nice glass of red wine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=106.8s)]
*  or a nice martini, he is the one that's getting hurt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  Like always, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Of course, as always, but I don't even understand [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=114.88s)]
*  the justification for it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=117.0s)]
*  So if you moderately smoke cigars and don't inhale them [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=118.96s)]
*  and you're not burning 10 a day or something, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=121.84s)]
*  if you have an occasional cigar, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=123.56s)]
*  the health risk is negligible. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=125.0s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=126.32s)]
*  People get hysterical when you say that, but it's true. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=127.28s)]
*  So there's clearly no public health crisis [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=130.0s)]
*  posed by cigar smoking of all things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=131.92s)]
*  What is this? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=134.6s)]
*  Sorry, Tucker, I don't know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  I can't explain it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  All I can explain to you is that everything [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=141.12s)]
*  we seem to enjoy, whether it's a glass of red wine, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=143.8s)]
*  a drink, a nice cigar, they're gonna tax. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  You know what's coming next, Tucker. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=151.12s)]
*  I brought a prop. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  You know what's coming next because the elites at Davos [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  have already warned us for this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  Red meat, our big fat steaks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=160.28s)]
*  That's what they're gonna be taxing next. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what they're gonna be taxing next. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=165.44s)]
*  Red meat, it's coming, Tucker, because we enjoy that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, of course, and taking someone's pleasure away [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=171.28s)]
*  is the ultimate sign of power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=173.84s)]
*  Lou, it's great to see you tonight. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=176.0s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=177.16s)]
*  Keep smoking them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=178.16s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Tucker. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=179.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUOEK4C0SDA&t=181.12s)]
