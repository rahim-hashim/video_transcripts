# Kid Rock tells critics to 'go f---' themselves
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI)
*  All right, Bob, so we're sitting where you made your most recent album, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=0.0s)]
*  and I hope at some point we can get a full shot of where we are [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=3.0s)]
*  because I've never seen anything like this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=5.5s)]
*  When did you make this album? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=10.3s)]
*  We got this studio done, brought everything down from my Michigan studios [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=13.0s)]
*  right before **** hit the fan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  COVID. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=19.6s)]
*  COVID. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=20.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=20.8s)]
*  So how did you spend COVID? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=21.5s)]
*  Right here, writing and recording. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=23.2s)]
*  Had more time to work on this album than since my first breakthrough album, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=25.2s)]
*  Double Without a Cause. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=29.2s)]
*  You know, you spend years with that first album. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=30.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=32.3s)]
*  And then from there, it's just a rat race of getting more records out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=32.8s)]
*  when you hit a lick and you're successful. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=35.4s)]
*  And this record, having a couple years just to fine tune every lyric [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=37.0s)]
*  and every note and leave some stuff raw and that feel like that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=40.7s)]
*  and see what works, what doesn't, to keep going back to the drawing board [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=43.8s)]
*  was just, you know, a luxury that I haven't been afforded in a long time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=46.4s)]
*  And, you know, you say it every album everyone does, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=50.0s)]
*  this is my best album. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=52.7s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=53.9s)]
*  Sell, sell. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=55.4s)]
*  But, you know, it really is, you know, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=56.2s)]
*  in my heart, I know it's one of my best efforts in a long time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=58.7s)]
*  Definitely since Rock and Roll Jesus. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=62.0s)]
*  You've been doing this 30 years, but you still bring intensity to it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=63.6s)]
*  Like how often do you come here? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=67.9s)]
*  Well, I'm a workaholic. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm here on an average day, 3.30 in the morning, Monday through Friday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=70.7s)]
*  And I'm usually the last one out about six o'clock at night. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=75.5s)]
*  In the studio? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=78.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm here from, yeah, 3.30 in the morning. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=80.4s)]
*  I'm writing, doing things, checking emails. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=82.5s)]
*  My head works best in the morning. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  I love to write then and work on music. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=87.3s)]
*  And then about 7 a.m. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  My buddy comes in, we play some pickleball, you know, do a cardio. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=90.2s)]
*  They get back, people start showing up at 9.30. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  I love that time in the morning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=95.8s)]
*  I get to myself and then, you know, my engineer gets here about 9.30. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=97.0s)]
*  We record all day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=100.5s)]
*  Grandpa gets his little nap in the afternoon and... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=101.8s)]
*  Groundhog day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=105.7s)]
*  Do it again, Monday through Friday. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=106.4s)]
*  Then Friday afternoon, things are feeling good. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=108.4s)]
*  My crack a beer in the afternoon. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=110.4s)]
*  Have a big time Friday and Saturday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=112.0s)]
*  Relax on Sunday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=114.3s)]
*  Get back to it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=115.4s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=116.6s)]
*  So you're, I mean, a rock star with a count in hours. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=121.3s)]
*  Yeah, rock star. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  I play one on TV pretty well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  That's just interesting though. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  So there's like a lot of discipline around it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=126.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  This doesn't happen without discipline. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=128.7s)]
*  You know, people only see the wild side usually and the party side [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=130.4s)]
*  and hopefully some of the, you know, charitable things and things [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=134.0s)]
*  I've done through the years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  There's both sides out there, but at the other day I worked my ass off. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=137.6s)]
*  And that's, that's what people ask me for advice. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=141.1s)]
*  I'm like, I work harder than you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=145.4s)]
*  So what was the idea behind this album? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  I kind of came together at the end by calling it bad reputation, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  you know, for a real good time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=154.4s)]
*  It was like pretty much sums me up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=155.9s)]
*  You know, it's everything. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=158.8s)]
*  I just wanted to go back a little bit to my roots of the hard [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  rock and hard rap, you know, heavier stuff, but I also wanted [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=163.4s)]
*  to throw in the tinges of, you know, Southern rock and country [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=166.8s)]
*  music and soul music and of course rock and roll all which I love, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=170.3s)]
*  you know, so much and have really honed my craft over the years [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=174.0s)]
*  to, you know, not just be fluent in one, but you know, touch on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=177.6s)]
*  them all at, you know, what my family and friends and fans [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  feel like I do at a pretty good level. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=183.8s)]
*  So if there was, I mean, a message behind the album, what would it be? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=185.8s)]
*  To my fans, I love you dearly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=192.8s)]
*  To you critics, haters and trolls, go f*** yourself. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=194.9s)]
*  That's pretty clear in the album, isn't it? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=198.9s)]
*  Like you're not kind of hiding that message, are you? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=200.9s)]
*  I have the things I do is like, you know, to solidify my fans [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=202.8s)]
*  and like I'll say a lot in this area, my friends, family and fans. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=206.5s)]
*  That's really all that matters to me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  And but I love the trolls and the haters and the critics who've [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=210.8s)]
*  been trying to, you know, knock me down for 20, 30 years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  And I just, I'm still standing still operating at the highest [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=216.9s)]
*  levels. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=219.8s)]
*  And so sometimes I do things purposefully, purposefully just [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=220.9s)]
*  to kind of be a wise ass or look like a little bit of a d*** just [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=224.9s)]
*  because my fans will get the tongue in cheek and the fun in it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  and the people that hate me will just go, God damn it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=230.3s)]
*  Just piss them off more. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=234.4s)]
*  So why haven't you been canceled? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=235.8s)]
*  Like people aren't allowed to say what they think you are. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=237.1s)]
*  I am uncancellable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=239.8s)]
*  Why's that? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=241.1s)]
*  I don't give a f***. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=242.9s)]
*  And I'm not in bed with any big corporate things at the end of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=245.0s)]
*  the day. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=247.5s)]
*  There's nobody I'm beholden to, no record companies, no corporate [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=247.8s)]
*  interests, no nothing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=250.8s)]
*  And you can't cancel me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=251.8s)]
*  I love it when they try. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=254.2s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that's absolutely fun. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=255.7s)]
*  Why aren't there more artists like that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=257.1s)]
*  Because they're in bed with record companies and you know corporate [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=259.6s)]
*  deals and instructors at every level and you know, it's um, and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=262.5s)]
*  if someone finds a way to get me a little bit here and there, I'll [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=267.1s)]
*  find another way around it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=269.6s)]
*  You never see artists talk like that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=271.0s)]
*  They seem very easy to intimidate. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=273.5s)]
*  At what point did you realize like you're just not going to be [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=276.6s)]
*  intimidated? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=279.1s)]
*  Day one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=281.6s)]
*  I think I crawled out of the womb with both middle fingers in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=282.0s)]
*  the air. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=284.3s)]
*  And that wasn't anything a lot of it, you know, is, you know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=284.8s)]
*  it's a little fun in there to kind of, you know, yeah, be rock [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=289.3s)]
*  and roll and be the bad guy and this that and the other because [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  you know, my heart's big at the end of the day and I have a lot [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=294.6s)]
*  of love and respect for anybody that shows that back to me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=296.5s)]
*  But you know, grandpa don't play no mess either. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=299.5s)]
*  Do the other guys in your business ever say to you like man, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=302.8s)]
*  I wish I could say exactly what I think all the time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=305.2s)]
*  Every f*** day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=308.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=309.8s)]
*  Every day, especially the country guys. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=310.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=312.8s)]
*  Because they got to be understandably careful. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=313.3s)]
*  Like, you know, the awards and things radio corporate [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=315.6s)]
*  interests. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  They mean a lot in country music. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=319.5s)]
*  The award stuff actually helped them out and rock and roll. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=320.8s)]
*  It's like, hey, you're getting an award for this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=323.3s)]
*  It's like tell them to f*** up and f*** off. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=324.6s)]
*  Like I care less about their awards. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=326.6s)]
*  You don't want any more awards. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=328.6s)]
*  I've never played any of those games. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  Anyway, you must have watched a lot of people sort of float off [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=332.0s)]
*  into the atmosphere in your... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  A lot of them come and go, you know, same old stories, you know, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=338.3s)]
*  we've all seen the behind the music. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's the same story. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=343.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  So how do you avoid that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  I just have a sense of discipline when things, you know, are [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=348.0s)]
*  getting too out of hand. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  Whether it was back in the day with drugs and alcohol, this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=352.5s)]
*  time you got to go like what's important. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=354.7s)]
*  I may need to reel this in, you know, and eventually, you know, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=356.5s)]
*  certain ages cut some things out and like, you know, focus on [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=359.5s)]
*  what you love, you know, your friends, your family, music, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=361.9s)]
*  you know, what's important in life. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=365.2s)]
*  You only got so much time, you know, let's make the most of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=366.4s)]
*  that time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=368.5s)]
*  Let's not waste it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=368.9s)]
*  Who are your fans? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=369.9s)]
*  Do you have a sight picture of who they are? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=370.7s)]
*  Yeah, hard working, hard working folks who love to have a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=373.09999999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=377.3s)]
*  Do you hear from them? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=378.7s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=380.9s)]
*  You can't not hear from people these days. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=383.0s)]
*  You can try and tune it out, it doesn't happen. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=387.0s)]
*  So do you feel like you've got a pretty good sense of what [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=388.9s)]
*  they think? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=390.8s)]
*  Yeah, they seem to think a lot of the things I do, not everything, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=392.7s)]
*  nobody's views align. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not opposed to anybody's opposing views. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=396.8s)]
*  I've got a lot of friends, you know, that we're still friends [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=399.1s)]
*  who are left a little farther than that on some things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=401.0s)]
*  I love getting together with them and cutting it up, have a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  couple beers and talking about things and hearing both sides. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, I think that's important. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  So you're going on tour, where are you going? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=410.1s)]
*  A lot of Midwest and South, little East Coast and some [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=413.5s)]
*  select dates on the West Coast. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=416.6s)]
*  America, I don't go outside. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=419.3s)]
*  I don't show a passport too much. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=420.70000000000005s)]
*  You don't? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=422.1s)]
*  Why you been all around the world? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=422.6s)]
*  You don't? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=423.8s)]
*  I just have no interest. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=424.6s)]
*  And I, you know, I get why some bands do this, that and the other. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=426.4s)]
*  And if I wanted to be the biggest deal in every country in the world, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  I could, but I'm like, I like my own bed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=432.4s)]
*  I'm big in Kentucky, man. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=435.2s)]
*  And that's good enough. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  In fact, that's so you're not playing venues that require [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=439.5s)]
*  vax cards? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=442.7s)]
*  No, and it was, you know, of course, yeah, that's what the headline [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=444.4s)]
*  ran from from the left, you know, like get rock set. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=447.09999999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, great, so I'm going to tour for me. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=449.7s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=451.2s)]
*  There was going to be no vax cards by the time we toured anyway. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  It was common knowledge. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=455.3s)]
*  Anybody with half a brain knew that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=456.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=457.8s)]
*  So, you know, the only place we didn't that we decided not to play was [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=458.2s)]
*  Buffalo, New York because New York was looked like it probably could [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  have something in place, you know, where you have to wear a mask [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=463.5s)]
*  or show a card or whatever. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=466.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, I'm not. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=467.6s)]
*  No. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=469.8s)]
*  That's why because it's stupid. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oby9X6LQLbI&t=470.90000000000003s)]
