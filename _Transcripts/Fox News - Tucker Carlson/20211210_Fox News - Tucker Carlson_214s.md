# Lovely lady humps: Tucker explores why Botox is used to make camels more attractive
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c)
*  So as far as we can tell, Congressman Eric Swalwell dearly loves two things, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=0.0s)]
*  having unnatural sex with Chinese spies and riding camels in the Middle East with no shirt on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=4.0s)]
*  So we've got some news for Congressman Swalwell tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=10.0s)]
*  The Super Bowl of camels is currently underway in the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=12.0s)]
*  This is Al-Dhafra Festival. It's the Super Bowl of camel pageantry. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=19.0s)]
*  Each December, 25,000 camels descend on this remote area of the UAE's western region. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=25.0s)]
*  Their owners come here from across the Gulf. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=32.0s)]
*  Each with the hope their camels will be crowned most beautiful. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=35.0s)]
*  Like beauty contestants, winning camels attract huge fan bases. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=39.0s)]
*  Some camels have their own hashtags on Instagram, and fans will even write poems about their beauty. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=44.0s)]
*  Famous camels also attract many high-cash offers. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=50.0s)]
*  So you may not think camels are beautiful, but a lot of people in the region do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=55.0s)]
*  The problem is not all camels are beautiful. So some of them get plastic surgery. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=59.0s)]
*  Now, right across the border in Saudi Arabia, there's a camel beauty pageant underway right now, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=65.0s)]
*  and a number of camels have been caught getting Botox and touch-ups. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=70.0s)]
*  Is this appropriate for the Dromedary community? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=75.0s)]
*  Is it ethical to give your camel plastic surgery? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=78.0s)]
*  We've gone right to the source of this. Forrest Galante is a wildlife biologist. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=82.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Forrest, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=85.0s)]
*  So let's say you have a camel, through no fault of his own, who's just unusually unattractive, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=87.0s)]
*  and you think, I'm going to fix this with a lip-talk or an ear-pin. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=92.0s)]
*  They can't give consent. Should that be allowed? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=97.0s)]
*  Well, Tucker, you could ask the same question about your dog at home, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=101.0s)]
*  Your dogs get cropped tails, they get their ears pinned, and that's not making news. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=104.0s)]
*  So it's basically the same thing. It's a pet that you're altering. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=108.0s)]
*  You make a really wise and common sense point that, I'm ashamed to say, never occurred to me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=113.0s)]
*  Now, how unattractive, because I think from the Western perspective, camels all kind of look the same. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=118.0s)]
*  Do you see a wide variety in camel aesthetics? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=125.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. It's, again, going back to the pet analogy, it's just like your dog at home. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=129.0s)]
*  Some people have beautiful dogs, show quality dogs. Others are less fortunate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=133.0s)]
*  Here's the thing, Tucker, I live in Southern California, so I've seen humps that have been enlarged [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=137.0s)]
*  and lips that have been blown up basically every day where I live, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=143.0s)]
*  so it's not the most unnatural thing in the world over here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=146.0s)]
*  And now we're pointing it out as being a problem over there on camels, and it's kind of a little double-edged there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=150.0s)]
*  That is such a smart point. Don't tell me they're getting hump implants in Saudi Arabia, though. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=156.0s)]
*  Oh, well, you know, different kinds of humps, but that is a thing that they're doing for their camels over there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=161.0s)]
*  They are doing botox fillers on the lips. They're stretching things. They're inflating the humps. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=166.0s)]
*  They're doing all kinds of different plastic surgeries to try and enhance the beauty and the aesthetic of these camels, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=171.0s)]
*  because the prize money is huge, by the way, millions and millions of dollars. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=178.0s)]
*  Can they, really quick, I don't have a ton of camel experience, but some horrible personalities on a camel, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=182.0s)]
*  nastiest animal God created, can they fix that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=187.0s)]
*  No, you know, they are typically jerks. They really are. You're not wrong about that, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=192.0s)]
*  but every now and then you get a sweetheart, and if you ask me, they're all beautiful. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=197.0s)]
*  If you draw the short end of the stick and you get an ugly camel, love it for its personality. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=201.0s)]
*  Forrest Galanty really sorting out one of the naughtiest problems in the Middle East tonight. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=206.0s)]
*  We appreciate your coming on. Thank you so much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrLCHz4i7c&t=211.0s)]
