# This is a bit of an ‘irony’ from Dems: Vivek Ramaswamy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4)
*  Vivek Ramaswamy is a man who's been around a lot of high finance. He's an entrepreneur and a really interesting person [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=0.0s)]
*  Sophisticated in the ways of the stuff. He joins us tonight Vic. Thanks so much for coming on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=6.8s)]
*  So they're basically threatening Elon Musk from the podium in the White House because he dares to bring back free speech [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  But ignoring this Democratic doughnut [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=16.06s)]
*  So it's funny it's this arranged marriage between big government and big business in this country Tucker [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=19.48s)]
*  You know it well where actually Elon was a darling by the way when he was pushing the religion [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=23.62s)]
*  He only fell out of favor when he started pushing free speech now take this guy Sam Bankman Fried [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=28.38s)]
*  Who actually goes by SBF in the crypto world, so let's call him SBF [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=33.46s)]
*  The interesting thing here is he actually bought protection. He played the old Goldman Sachs pre 2008 game [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=37.66s)]
*  You'll remember this Goldman Sachs paid for a lot of protection from the government to pay out [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=44.26s)]
*  It's like an insurance policy when it matters most when the 2008 financial crisis hit [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=48.68s)]
*  That's why Goldman Sachs got bailed out while Lehman Brothers didn't well [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=53.22s)]
*  Sbf appears to be playing a really similar game [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=57.12s)]
*  He's a top donor to the Democratic Party even as his exchange was going bust yet [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=59.58s)]
*  There's one small nuance to this Tucker [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=64.48s)]
*  I think they might actually go after him and punish him anyway [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=66.44s)]
*  And here's the funny part not a lot of people know he actually had pledged up to a billion dollars in donations [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=69.74s)]
*  This cycle and next so there were actually a lot of Democrats upset with him that he only gave 30 to 40 million [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=76.1s)]
*  So if they do go after him, it's because he didn't buy the gold-plated insurance policy [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=80.92s)]
*  He just stopped at the cheap version of the insurance policy instead [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=85.12s)]
*  And so if he is indicted or if he does get in trouble [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=88.76s)]
*  That'll be one of the lessons of the story for future crony capitalists is pay up for full freight or else you're gonna get in trouble [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Amazing just in ten seconds since you're old enough to remember an oligarch pledging to throw a billion dollars into a Democratic election [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=97.68s)]
*  Democrats used to complain about big money, right? Didn't they that's exactly right? What happened to the Citizens United? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=104.56s)]
*  Corporations are not people old left the party that used to be skeptical of the expansion of corporate power [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  That's a corporations shouldn't act like people now are the ones who want those corporations and corporatocratic autocrats to act more like people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  That's a bit of an irony. It's an about face over the last ten years [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=124.28s)]
*  But what they realized is you know what? It's not an arranged marriage where we have to love our partner [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=127.68s)]
*  It's more just like mutual [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=131.54000000000002s)]
*  Prostitution and it works as long as each side gets something out of the trade birth the illegitimate child of the woke industrial complex [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=133.44s)]
*  That's where you get to where we are. Oh [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=140.12s)]
*  Vivek they must really hate you because you can explain it so very well. I appreciate you're doing it here. Thank you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeBFA2OWJy4&t=142.20000000000002s)]
