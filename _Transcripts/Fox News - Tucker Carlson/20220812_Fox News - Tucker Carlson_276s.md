# Dhillon: DOJ sent a message they 'can do this to you too'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg)
*  Now let's bring in Harmeet Dhillon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=0.0s)]
*  Harmeet, what would you do if you're President Trump? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=2.04s)]
*  Would you support the release of this affidavit? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=5.12s)]
*  Well, first, I do represent the president in various civil matters, but I'm not speaking [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=8.56s)]
*  as a part of his criminal defense team. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=13.52s)]
*  And so I think it is important for the lawyers who are looking at that affidavit to look [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=15.88s)]
*  at it and then make their considered judgment as to whether it tells the true story. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=19.52s)]
*  In my opinion, I have said publicly, the warrant itself is really not where the meat is. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=23.96s)]
*  Where the meat is, is the affidavits that underlie the warrant. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  That is what the FBI told the magistrate judge in order to get this warrant. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=33.2s)]
*  And there may have been more than one affidavit. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=38.36s)]
*  And so it is unclear to me that the DOJ is offering to unseal those. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=40.38s)]
*  They don't usually unseal those until there is an indictment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  And I think if the warrant tells an incomplete story, it may not be to the advantage of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=47.24s)]
*  Trump team to unseal it at this time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=50.96s)]
*  The whole story needs to be told. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  I think that the DOJ, as you said in your intro, Brian, is really stumbling. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=56.16s)]
*  They're playing defense. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=60.28s)]
*  They're trying to do this the opposite way that it should be. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=61.4s)]
*  In the Southern District of Florida, the normal procedure, as I understand from criminal defense [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  attorneys who practice there, is that this conversation is supposed to be had between [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=68.64s)]
*  the prosecution and the target of the subpoena in advance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=73.2s)]
*  And then you go to the judge and ask the judge after that discussion has had. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=77.6s)]
*  Here they flip that order. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=81.32s)]
*  They just went into court without having that conversation first. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=82.8s)]
*  And the judges ordered them to have that conversation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=85.92s)]
*  So without seeing it, I can't really say. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=88.46s)]
*  But I do know that it seems like they're not telling the full story here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=90.16s)]
*  What brought us to this moment, and just to qualify it, Newsweek has this story that Merrick [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=93.44s)]
*  Garland didn't sign off on this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=97.56s)]
*  They did it without his knowledge or without his blessing, didn't know exactly what was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=98.92s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=102.72s)]
*  Next thing you know, we hear about a press conference. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=103.72s)]
*  And Harmeet, they're late. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=105.72s)]
*  They're late to give what, a seven-minute address without taking questions? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=107.16s)]
*  What's the delay? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  I could have, you could have ad libbed, you or I could have ad libbed this in our sleep. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=111.84s)]
*  What was, what is going on behind the scenes? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  It looked like a hostage video to me, Brian. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=119.48s)]
*  It was really bizarre. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=121.4s)]
*  And, and frankly, even earlier today, you saw all of the, you know, allies of the administration, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=122.4s)]
*  Sheldon Whitehouse, come out and say, oh, of course, this kind of thing would have been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=128.52s)]
*  well below the scope of Merrick Garland. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=131.52s)]
*  That's obviously nonsense. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  When you're raiding a former president's home, which is unprecedented, it had to come from [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=135.76s)]
*  the top. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=139.68s)]
*  And I think that the DOJ is in damage control mode here because if it really, when I first [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=141.6s)]
*  saw this news, I said, this has to be about something else. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=147.32s)]
*  It can't be about presidential records because it is frankly ludicrous to go to this type [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=149.8s)]
*  of, you know, extreme tactics over some 18-month-old stale documents that, who cares? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  This, this, this librarian, head librarian of the National Archives is up in arms. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=163.16s)]
*  He's upset that his documents aren't there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=167.8s)]
*  Where is his upset about Obama's 30 million pages of documents? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Where is his upset about how Hillary Clinton treated classified documents on her server? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=174.84s)]
*  This is a ridiculous premise for an FBI SWAT team of 30 FBI agents to go through for nine [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=181.28s)]
*  hours. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  It just doesn't add up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  And so I still think that's what's happening here is that this raid was a pretext for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  a fishing expedition that has come up empty. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  And now they're trying to craft a different narrative to explain their outrageous behavior [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  and their undermining of trust of the American people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=201.8s)]
*  I don't think anyone has to tell any viewer that President Trump hasn't been playing a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=205.12s)]
*  perfect game. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=207.96s)]
*  But I really challenge anyone who says he hasn't had a really good week. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=209.08s)]
*  On Monday, this egregious activity, barring this doesn't go a different direction, which [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=212.28s)]
*  I don't think it is, especially after speaking to so many people on his team and hearing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=215.96s)]
*  them worried about things in the past but not this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=220.72s)]
*  When you think about the Southern District of New York and their, what, three year investigation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=223.08s)]
*  that produced nothing? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  And then they meet with the AG and his company is going exceedingly well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=228.3s)]
*  This might be one of the best weeks for Donald Trump, who suddenly has, not only did he do [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  perfect on the primary this week, but now he seems to have most of the party lining [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=237.12s)]
*  up behind him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=241.08s)]
*  Your final thought? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=242.08s)]
*  Well, look, it might be a good thing politically, but I think it's a bad thing for the country [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=243.08s)]
*  to see the American Department of Justice and FBI act in this outrageous manner. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=247.62s)]
*  Every American should be afraid that they can do this to you as well, and that is not [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=252.42s)]
*  a good place for this country to be. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=256.26s)]
*  They need to stop. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=257.7s)]
*  True. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=259.14s)]
*  And I get worried that the IRS is muscling up and they're going to have the same tactics. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=260.26s)]
*  Harmeet, thanks so much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCjLH-uyhkg&t=263.7s)]
