# American people need to appreciate freedom: Cuban immigrant Yoel Diaz
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U)
*  Now Yoel Diaz arrived in the United States in 2021 on a K-1 visa. Before that, he was a computer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=0.0s)]
*  science teacher in Cuba earning just $12 a month. He now has a YouTube channel with his wife Marie, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=7.12s)]
*  who is an American. The channel is about Diaz's appreciation for America and how blown away he is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=14.32s)]
*  by even the smallest of luxuries here. Here's one of his recent videos from Fenway Park. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=21.12s)]
*  Oh my God, look at this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=30.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=38.0s)]
*  This is really cool. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=48.0s)]
*  Now last month Yoel Diaz uploaded this video showing his very first paycheck from his time in the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=60.0s)]
*  Yoel and Marisa Diaz join us now. Thank you both so much for being here. You know, it warms my heart to watch those videos and seeing the country through your eyes, especially because, you know, oftentimes on the news, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=90.0s)]
*  and in social media, we hear people complaining about a lot of things that probably seem silly to you, but really taking for granted our God-given rights enshrined in the Constitution. And so through your eyes, can you share with us, what do those rights, what do those freedoms mean to you? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=118.0s)]
*  First one, free speech. That was important for me. And you know, the freedom of the dream, that's something I never have in my own country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, we can't, in Cuba, you can't dream to have better opportunities. And of course Cuba is a communist dictatorship and freedom of speech is not allowed. Even us doing our content here risks us being able to go to Cuba to see our family again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=160.0s)]
*  I can only imagine what it means to you to be freed from the fear that you formerly felt and to be able to speak what's in your heart here at home. What are the kinds of reactions that you're getting from people as you do? You openly open your heart to other people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=180.0s)]
*  Well, we get a range of reactions, to be honest with you, we have, you know, people who don't like what we're saying about the Cuban government and communism in general. And then we have lots more people who really are receptive to the content because it resonates not only with Americans, but also children of immigrants who can see their families in Joel and immigrants themselves as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=200.0s)]
*  So it's, it's a range of reactions to be honest. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's cool. It's cool having that experience because I always put in the, in the old video, I'm talking to the American people because when I come in here the first time, I saw something spiritual and free. When you see this and you come in with, in my age of 38, I'm old and you come in here, I say, wow, this is freedom. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=230.0s)]
*  And you say, wow, there's somebody can people appreciate that, need to appreciate that because I never have. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=260.0s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. Well, I appreciate you sharing that reminder because you're exactly right. These freedoms are too often taken for granted, but they are freedoms that we must all celebrate and do all that we can to protect. Thank you both so much for joining us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=266.0s)]
*  I wish you a wonderful night. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=284.0s)]
*  Thank you. It's an honor. Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=286.0s)]
*  Thank you as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzGYEGnae1U&t=288.0s)]
