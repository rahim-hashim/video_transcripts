# Kari Lake: We will not be intimidated
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM)
*  So no one really expected the governor's race in Arizona to become one of the most hotly contested, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=0.0s)]
*  most closely covered races in the last 10 years, but that's what it is thanks to Carrie Lake. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=5.84s)]
*  And Carrie Lake is a huge threat because she comes out of the media. 30 years in the news [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=12.0s)]
*  ministry knows exactly how it works and she can explain it. So it probably shouldn't surprise you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=16.96s)]
*  that her office was attacked recently, apparently, in a politically motivated attack. FBI police and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=22.56s)]
*  bomb squads were called to her campaign headquarters in Phoenix over a suspicious [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=28.64s)]
*  piece of mail that contained white powder. So we still don't know what that powder is and there's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=33.2s)]
*  some debate over whether the FBI has even tested it. So to find out exactly what is going on in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=37.6s)]
*  that story, we are proud to have Carrie Lake join us tonight. Carrie Lake, thanks so much for coming [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=42.56s)]
*  on. So there are all kinds of versions of this story. What is the truth? Well, the truth is that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=47.28s)]
*  we had delivered at our office a couple of envelopes that had white powder in them. One [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=53.92s)]
*  of them, our employee, our staffer opened up and immediately realized there was a problem with it, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=59.52s)]
*  threw it in the garbage can and then another staffer grabbed it from the garbage can and then [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=65.76s)]
*  all of a sudden we had several people exposed to it. The police showed up, the bomb squad showed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=69.76s)]
*  up, firefighters and the FBI and they took the envelopes. There were a couple of them at minimum, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=74.4s)]
*  maybe more, and we were told they took them for testing. Now this is the first time hearing that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=79.6s)]
*  so maybe you know more about it than I do. I've been busy campaigning and we've just been monitoring [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=84.72s)]
*  our staffer's health and so far so good, but we are counting on the FBI to test that and let us know [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=90.0s)]
*  if we should be concerned about any danger. Apparently the contents of the letter were [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=97.2s)]
*  incredibly vulgar and threatening and so we take it as a legitimate threat, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=101.76s)]
*  but we're just happy that so far our staffers are okay. Since we're not in Arizona, we can't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=109.68s)]
*  tell. What kind of coverage is this receiving in your media in the state? I did see it get some [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=115.04s)]
*  coverage. You know, I have not wanted to get much coverage out of this because let's face it, I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  really would rather this be investigated and we find out who did it and catch the culprits, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=127.04s)]
*  but the real story is, I'll be honest, this is minor compared to what I'm going to go up against [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=131.44s)]
*  when I win this race. We are going to secure the border and take down the cartels at the border. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=137.6s)]
*  I don't think threatening letters are going to be the worst of it. I think there's much more coming [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=143.04s)]
*  and we're ready for it. We will not be intimidated, Tucker. We've got big issues facing us. We have a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=148.0s)]
*  border with narco-terrorists in control and while I'm upset that these letters were sent and I'm [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  monitoring and care deeply about my staff, I know that there will be more threats to come [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=158.72s)]
*  and we will stare them down because we will secure Arizona. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=163.92s)]
*  They're republican-led border states that have done nothing to secure the border, so if you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  actually do that as governor of Arizona, you're going to get major pushback from the administration. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  Of course, we'll be covering it and rooting for you. Carrie Lake, thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=177.44s)]
*  Thank you. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofW0w24yjFM&t=182.32s)]
