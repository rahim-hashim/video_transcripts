# The government is after the 2nd Amendment: Mark McCloskey
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA)
*  Meanwhile, people who defend themselves against criminals get the maximum possible sentence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=0.0s)]
*  The government gets to defend itself with bodyguards. Politicians have tons of bodyguards [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=4.8s)]
*  you pay for. Congress is so afraid of the people they govern they built a wall around the Capitol [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  this week. But you can't fight back. And we began to see this accelerate in 2020 during the BLM [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=14.08s)]
*  riots. So a BLM mob broke the gate into Mark and Patricia McCloskey's property in St. Louis. They [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=20.64s)]
*  were having dinner. All of a sudden the mob shows up. And so in response they did what you would do [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=26.08s)]
*  if you were awake. You grabbed your firearms. You don't shoot anybody back off. Those firearms [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  were lawfully owned. They were on their property as was the mob. Here's what it looked like. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=36.64s)]
*  Remember that? They were racist. Right. A group of highly entitled children of orthodontists showed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=56.4s)]
*  up on their property to threaten them and they said back off. So they're racist, said the Washington [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Post. And then of course a Soros-backed prosecutor called Kim Gardner charged them. Charged the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=68.64s)]
*  McCloskeys with crime. Not the mob. The McCloskeys for daring to defend themselves. Their guns were [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=74.56s)]
*  seized. Now the point of this of course is not to make anybody safe from this. It's not to make [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=79.52s)]
*  anybody safer. Just the opposite. And St. Louis has not become safer. It's become much more [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=84.8s)]
*  dangerous. Under Kim Gardner the city has experienced its highest murder rate in decades. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=90.08s)]
*  So public safety is not the point. The point is disarming you so you can't defend yourself [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=94.8s)]
*  against their plans for you. Now thankfully Mark McCloskey and his wife were pardoned [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=100.0s)]
*  these outrageous charges by the governor of the state. Thank God. Mark McCloskey is still around. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=106.24s)]
*  He joins us now. Mark McCloskey thank you so much for coming on. Your story was so significant [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=110.56s)]
*  because it seemed like the beginning of a trend where political prosecutors send the message that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=115.36s)]
*  you're not allowed to defend yourself no matter how crazy and chaotic and dangerous the country [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=122.8s)]
*  becomes. Don't take up arms to defend your property, your family, your own life. And I think [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=126.72s)]
*  it's fair to say it was the beginning of a trend, no? Well it was and you know this is not accidental [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=131.6s)]
*  and it's not a result of inadvertence or incompetence. What's our right to defend ourselves? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=137.2s)]
*  It's a God-given right. It's a basic human right. Well the powers that be that want to destroy our [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=142.48s)]
*  government, want to destroy our freedoms, and want to destroy our culture, they can't tolerate the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=147.44s)]
*  concept of there being a power greater than government. They have to do away with your [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=152.16s)]
*  God-given rights, all your rights, and let's leave you with nothing but government granted [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=156.48s)]
*  privileges that can be revoked at a moment's notice. I mean look at what's going on. We've got it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=161.44s)]
*  We've got a vice president of the United States who encouraged the riots so the riots are proper. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=166.88s)]
*  They should continue. Bail people out of jail so they can riot the next day. We got a government [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=171.68s)]
*  that encourages crime and then discourages law enforcement by defunding the police and these [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=176.48s)]
*  George Soros prosecutors like I have here in St. Louis. And then what do the people do? If there's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=182.24s)]
*  rampant crime and the police won't enforce the law and the prosecutors won't prosecute the criminals, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=188.88s)]
*  people have to defend themselves. So then what? That same government then criminalizes self-defense [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=194.64s)]
*  and throws you in jail. Now you know it wasn't cheap to defend ourselves and then to add insult [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  to injury our Bar Association required us to do a hundred hours each of pro bono legal services. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  So that's 200 hours of our time. That's about a hundred and fifty thousand buck fine right there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=213.2s)]
*  But we can we can handle that. But think about that poor George Allen Kelly down in Texas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=218.48s)]
*  73 year old man with a million dollar bond for doing nothing more than defending himself. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=224.08s)]
*  The whole purpose of all this is to strip our rights away, strip away our God-given freedoms [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  and give absolute control to the government, criminalize self-defense and glorify the government. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=234.4s)]
*  Yeah so they start a crime wave and then demand you give up your guns. Yeah no thanks. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=242.24s)]
*  Mark Gluski, great to see you. Thank you so much. Thank you Tucker. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=247.44s)]
*  Catch our nightly opens stories that are changing the world and changing your life from Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke1KwmHO6xA&t=254.08s)]
