# Tucker: At least he’s not being misgendered in court
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c)
*  So you remember Sam Brinton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=0.0s)]
*  He was the world famous MIT trained nuclear waste disposal expert who ran the program [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=1.84s)]
*  for Joe Biden, released in court today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=7.78s)]
*  He's accused of stealing ladies underwear in their luggage at a bunch of different airports, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  presumably wearing it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=14.64s)]
*  It's not weird, by the way, don't judge. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=15.94s)]
*  Today he was at a preliminary hearing for stealing a $2,000 bag from the airport in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=18.2s)]
*  Minneapolis. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=22.68s)]
*  Brinton's lawyers had filed multiple requests for him to attend the hearing remotely, saying [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=23.68s)]
*  he's having, and we're quoting, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=27.94s)]
*  employment issues. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=29.14s)]
*  He sure is. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=30.14s)]
*  The judge denied that request, but the judge did accommodate a far more significant demand [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=31.62s)]
*  from Sam Brinton. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=36.3s)]
*  He went along with Brinton's request to be called MX. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=37.3s)]
*  We're not going to guess that, I pronounce it MX Brinton instead of Mr. Brinton. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=40.46s)]
*  So the bottom line is our gender fluid nuclear waste expert friend may be going to jail for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=46.58s)]
*  up to five years and he may not have a job, but at least he's not being misgendered. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=50.22s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=55.22s)]
*  changing the world and changing your life. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=60.34s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB1_rgL14c&t=62.86s)]
