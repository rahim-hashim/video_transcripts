# 'QAnon Shaman's' lawyer speaks out after Jan. 6 bombshell footage released
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY)
*  Albert Watkins represented Jacob Chansley at his trial. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=0.0s)]
*  He had not seen that video evidence [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=3.0s)]
*  until we broadcast it on Monday, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=4.2s)]
*  and we're happy to have him join us now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=5.64s)]
*  Mr. Watkins, thank you for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=6.8s)]
*  If you could just restate clearly, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=8.68s)]
*  just to make sure that, you know, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to put words in your mouth. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Had you seen that clearly exculpatory tape [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  of your client at trial? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=17.12s)]
*  No. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=19.8s)]
*  We went through extraordinary efforts [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=21.2s)]
*  on behalf of our client [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  to put him in a position of knowledge. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  That's my duty as an agent of the court, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  to make sure that he knew everything [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  that the government had, good and bad, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=35.48s)]
*  to put him in that position [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=39.44s)]
*  to make a learned, informed, voluntary decision [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=40.72s)]
*  about whether to go to trial or take a plea. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=45.0s)]
*  And remember, this is a man who had tremendous intelligence, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=48.8s)]
*  very gentle, very, very articulate, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=53.44s)]
*  who was diagnosed 15 years earlier by the government [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=58.44s)]
*  with a mental health issue. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  And the government knew that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=64.92s)]
*  The government knew through three hearings [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  when we begged and pleaded to get this man [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=69.56s)]
*  out of solitary confinement, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=73.36s)]
*  literally falling into an abyss mentally. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  And through each of those three hearings, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=80.56s)]
*  that government assistant U.S. attorney [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=82.52s)]
*  knew the most important aspect of that hearing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  was that Jake was not violent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=88.92s)]
*  The government knew. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  They knew that Jake had walked around [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=95.32s)]
*  with all of these police officers. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=98.36s)]
*  They had that video footage. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=101.8s)]
*  It wasn't disclosed to me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=102.88s)]
*  It wasn't provided to me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=104.64s)]
*  I requested it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  I filed the requisite pleadings for it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  And whether I did or not, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=109.88s)]
*  they had a duty, an absolute duty, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=111.6s)]
*  with zero discretion to provide it to me [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=114.76s)]
*  so that I could share it with my client. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=119.44s)]
*  I never got it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=121.76s)]
*  Very simple question. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=122.96s)]
*  It's shocking that this could happen [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=124.68s)]
*  and happen with the knowledge of Liz Cheney [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=126.16s)]
*  and Adam Kinziger and Chuck Schumer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=128.6s)]
*  and all the ghouls around the story. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  How can this man still be in prison tonight? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=132.44s)]
*  He's still in jail tonight, right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=134.44s)]
*  Well, it's a tragedy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=136.84s)]
*  I mean, what's happened is truly a dagger [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=138.44s)]
*  in the heart of our American justice system. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=140.8s)]
*  We can't allow it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And but for you disclosing it, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=146.12s)]
*  and whether this isn't about you, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=149.32s)]
*  this isn't about January 6th, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=151.2s)]
*  this is about our justice system being so compromised, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  the very integrity and core of that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  which we wore as a badge of honor [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=162.2s)]
*  for the entirety of our nation's history [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=164.56s)]
*  has been rendered a vile, disgusting mess [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=167.0s)]
*  by a Department of Justice [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=170.76s)]
*  that was running amok. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=172.24s)]
*  And they didn't share the video of my client, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=174.84s)]
*  the footage of my client with nine officers [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=178.52s)]
*  surrounding him, peacefully wandering about, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  trying to help him, trying to get him access [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  to the Senate chamber. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  They didn't because it didn't fit their narrative. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=189.96s)]
*  And but for you, disclosing it, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=195.08s)]
*  I don't know where we'd be. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Why it is, why they're attacking you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=201.28s)]
*  makes no sense at all because by doing that, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=203.52s)]
*  they're shrouding in secrecy or trying to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=206.28s)]
*  their own assault on democracy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=209.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's dogs barking to me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=213.0s)]
*  Speaking for myself, I don't care at all. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=215.0s)]
*  But I feel for this man who I've never met [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  sitting in jail tonight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=219.28s)]
*  I mean, it's really beyond me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=220.44s)]
*  He's a tremendous, intelligent, peaceful man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  Albert Watkins, his former attorney. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=226.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdL5VtjbtY&t=228.32000000000002s)]
