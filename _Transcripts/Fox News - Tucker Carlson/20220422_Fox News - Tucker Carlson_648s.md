# Tucker: This will cost the Disney corporation a ton of money
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=0.0s)]
*  Today we told you earlier in the week about how the left is very mad, in fact trying to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=2.4s)]
*  shut down a site called Libs of TikTok. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=5.76s)]
*  Why are they so mad at Libs of TikTok? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=8.36s)]
*  Well, here's one of the reasons. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=10.24s)]
*  Over the past half year or so, video after video has appeared on social media showing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  school teachers bragging enthusiastically about how they push their personal sexual [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=17.14s)]
*  politics, often weird and gruesome sexual politics, on the small children they're supposed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=21.88s)]
*  to be teaching. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Now the students in question are not teenagers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  They're kindergartners, first graders, kids who have no perspective on life and no power [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=29.8s)]
*  to fight back. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  So many parents saw these videos, in some cases on Libs of TikTok, and they were shocked. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=36.2s)]
*  They had no idea that anything like this was happening in the classroom. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=41.2s)]
*  Having some purple-haired loser in a nose ring convince her six-year-old to get a sex [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=44.24s)]
*  change is not why most people send their children to school. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=47.84s)]
*  So they complained. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  The parents did. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  And across the country, Republican officeholders responded by promising to do something about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=58.08s)]
*  They made outraged noises, but then in very short order, they moved on to talking about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=59.08s)]
*  Ukraine, which is what they really care about, not you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=62.68s)]
*  In the end, only one state really did anything about this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  That would be the state of Florida under Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=68.92s)]
*  Several weeks ago, the Florida legislature passed a law banning teachers from bragging [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=71.64s)]
*  about their own sex lives to small children. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=75.58s)]
*  Now news reporters went crazy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=78.64s)]
*  They described this legislation as the don't say gay bill. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=80.36s)]
*  But as always, that was a lie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=83.32s)]
*  This bill didn't even mention the word gay. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=85.48s)]
*  Nothing to do with gays. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  But voters seemed to know that intuitively. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=89.0s)]
*  Even most Democrats in Florida supported this law. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=91.6s)]
*  The polling firm Public Opinion Strategies found out why they do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=94.9s)]
*  Quote, fully two-thirds of voters believe it is inappropriate for teachers or school [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=98.08s)]
*  personnel to discuss gender identity with children in kindergarten through third grade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=102.4s)]
*  Well, of course it is. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=106.8s)]
*  Everyone thinks that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=108.92s)]
*  So if there was ever a law that accurately reflected public opinion, which should matter [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=109.92s)]
*  in a democracy, this was the law. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=114.16s)]
*  But across the country in the state of California, Bob Iger was watching and Bob Iger didn't [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=117.2s)]
*  like it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Bob Iger is the 71-year-old former head of Disney. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=122.48s)]
*  He's a bundler for Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=125.08s)]
*  He's got some free time and strong political views, so he promptly tweeted that the Florida [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=127.68s)]
*  law was immoral somehow. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=131.16s)]
*  In an interview later with CNN with Chris Wallace, Iger explained that preventing teachers [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=134.2s)]
*  from promoting gender reassignment surgery to kindergartners was, quote, harmful to children. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=138.76s)]
*  Iger never explained how this was harmful, but it didn't matter. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=144.52s)]
*  Over at Disney headquarters, his remarks caused huge problems for the company's new CEO, Bob [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=148.02s)]
*  Chapik. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=152.76s)]
*  Now, by all accounts, Bob Chapik is not especially political. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=153.76s)]
*  He's not an activist. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  He's a marketing guy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=157.76s)]
*  So his first instinct was not to get involved, not to comment on what was happening in Florida. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  And that seemed wise given how much at stake Disney has in Florida. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=163.4s)]
*  They own a theme park in Orlando, you may have heard. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=167.02s)]
*  That's an enormous physical asset that cannot be loaded on a truck and moved. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=169.72s)]
*  So maybe don't mess with Florida. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=173.04s)]
*  As Chapik put it in a memo, quote, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=175.0s)]
*  He wrote that on March 7th, explaining why Disney planned to take a pass on this controversy [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=180.4s)]
*  because they make movies, not laws. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=184.84s)]
*  But Bob Chapik's employees had other ideas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=187.68s)]
*  Whipped into a frenzy by their former boss, Bob Iger, Disney staffers demanded action [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=190.84s)]
*  immediately. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=195.68s)]
*  And then, because he is weak and not especially bright, Bob Chapik caved to their demands. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=196.68s)]
*  He agreed to hold a town hall with the grieved Disney employees who wanted him somehow to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=202.78s)]
*  take control of the Florida legislature. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=207.5s)]
*  Here's how that went. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=210.54s)]
*  I hope you've all read my most recent note in which I pledged to be a better ally for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  the LGBTQ plus community, apologize for not being the ally that you needed me to be, and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=217.22s)]
*  committed to ensuring that our company lives up to its values. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=223.34s)]
*  Your words have made a real impact on me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=227.98s)]
*  I understand that we've made mistakes and the pain that those mistakes have caused. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=231.42s)]
*  And I know that our silence wasn't just about the bill in Florida, but about every time [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  an individual or institution that should have stood up for this community did not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=240.56s)]
*  I want to thank the LGBTQIA plus advisory council. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=245.26s)]
*  Hey Bob, what does LGBTQIA stand for? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=249.42s)]
*  You have no freaking clue. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=254.82s)]
*  That's not the interesting part. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=256.68s)]
*  The interesting part of what you just heard was, your words have made a real impact on [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=258.02s)]
*  me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=261.94s)]
*  In other words, you now have full control over my entire central nervous system. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=262.94s)]
*  You own my brain. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=266.14s)]
*  Do with me what you will. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=267.58s)]
*  And they did. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=269.88s)]
*  Bob Chapik soon reversed his position, Disney's position, completely. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  Going forward, not only did the Disney corporation fervently disagree with the law the Florida [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  legislature had passed, according to Bob Chapik, Disney had decided to override the expressed [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=279.85999999999996s)]
*  will of Florida's voters and overturn that law. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=285.94s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=289.46s)]
*  Our goal as a company, said Bob Chapik, is for this law to be repealed by the legislature [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=290.46s)]
*  or struck down in the courts. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=295.46s)]
*  And we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=297.42s)]
*  achieve that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=300.96s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=302.3s)]
*  What? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=303.3s)]
*  You thought it was an entertainment company, but no. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=304.3s)]
*  From its headquarters in Los Angeles, the Disney corporation had now decided it runs [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=308.6s)]
*  the state of Florida. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=313.14s)]
*  So for people who want to defend democracy, which is a system in which voters get to govern [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=315.46s)]
*  themselves, this was quite a departure. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=320.18s)]
*  This is oligarchy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=323.29999999999995s)]
*  Corporate CEOs deciding what the laws should be? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=324.73999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  That's their new position. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  But in the meantime, Disney employees set about trying to undermine the intent of Florida's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  law. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=334.17999999999995s)]
*  If teachers could no longer promote transgenderism to kindergartners, Disney planned to step into [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=335.17999999999995s)]
*  the breach and do it themselves. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  Here's internal footage from Disney obtained by journalist Chris Ruffo. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=341.7s)]
*  Last summer, we removed all of the gendered greetings in relationship to our lives feels. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  So we no longer say ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=352.46s)]
*  We've trained, we provided training for all of our cast members in relationship to that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  So now they know it's hello everyone or hello friends. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=361.09999999999997s)]
*  Oh, so it's no more boys and girls. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=364.3s)]
*  Disney World is now non-binary. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=368.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=369.5s)]
*  That's the diversity and inclusion lady. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=371.54s)]
*  You're not surprised. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=373.1s)]
*  What is surprising is that the head of a publicly held company like Disney would announce in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=374.48s)]
*  public that he's in charge of a state that we thought was run by the voters of that state. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, in Florida, Ron DeSantis noticed this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=386.90000000000003s)]
*  He's the elected governor and he decided to find out how does the system work. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=389.92s)]
*  He decided to test democracy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  So during a special session of the Florida legislature this week, DeSantis led an effort [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=395.54s)]
*  to strip Disney of what turned out to be a remarkable set of special perks that company [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=399.66s)]
*  had enjoyed for more than 50 years. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  You are not treated like Disney is treated in Florida. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=407.06s)]
*  You have never been treated that well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=409.58000000000004s)]
*  So after the special session, no more will Disney World operate as its own independent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=412.3s)]
*  country within the state of Florida. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=417.66s)]
*  Yes, that's how they were governed by themselves. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=419.54s)]
*  And now going forward, Disney is going to have to pay its taxes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=422.38s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=425.3s)]
*  Just like everybody else. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, if you've lived in this country for more than, say, five years, ask yourself, what's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=428.54s)]
*  the political party that has always told you big companies should pay their taxes? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  Corporate tax breaks are bad. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=436.94s)]
*  Well, of course, that's always been the Democratic Party. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  So you would imagine the Democrats in Florida would applaud a move like this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=441.54s)]
*  When was the last time you heard liberals complain about stripping tax breaks from big [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  business? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=450.54s)]
*  Never before in history. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=451.54s)]
*  It's never happened. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=452.54s)]
*  And yet it just did happen. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=453.54s)]
*  These are Democrats in the Florida legislature. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  They are on the verge of tears as they learn that the Disney corporation might have to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=457.7s)]
*  pay taxes. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=461.98s)]
*  The clerk will unlock the machine and members will proceed to vote. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  Clerk will lock the machine, announce the vote. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  68 days, 38 days, Mr. Speaker. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=485.14s)]
*  Show the bill passes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=487.1s)]
*  You may have sensed the Democratic Party over the last decade or so has been captured by [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=490.74s)]
*  corporate interests. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  But you never thought that you would hear on the floor of a state legislature Democrats [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=498.42s)]
*  scream with anguish at the idea that a big company might have to pay its taxes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=507.74s)]
*  But now very clear. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=509.3s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=510.86s)]
*  Well, a lot of things. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=511.86s)]
*  Here's one. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=512.86s)]
*  Disney spends millions of dollars electing lawmakers in the state of Florida. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=513.86s)]
*  If those lawmakers couldn't do their job in this case, they couldn't act on Disney's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=516.9s)]
*  behalf, the law passed and DeSantis signed it into law this afternoon. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's going to cost the Disney corporation a ton of money, which in turn may mean less [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=524.26s)]
*  money for the Florida Democrats you just saw shrieking in the video. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=529.02s)]
*  So there was some self-interest involved here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=533.18s)]
*  But it wasn't just that because it wasn't just Democratic officeholders who were upset [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  by the idea that an elected governor might be more powerful than an unelected corporation [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=538.78s)]
*  headquartered across the continent. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=543.34s)]
*  The media were very upset too. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=545.52s)]
*  Very upset. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=547.4s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=548.4s)]
*  If Ron DeSantis could pass an anti-Muslim bill for the state of Florida, he would. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=549.4s)]
*  If he could pass an anti-CRT, if he could say it's illegal to say you're black, I'm [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=554.36s)]
*  pretty sure the guy would try it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=558.2s)]
*  I mean, look, DeSantis has, this is a playbook out of Putin and we saw where this goes. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=559.84s)]
*  It's very Soviet and it's weird how Republicans, they keep tacking back to the old Soviet Union [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=564.04s)]
*  and they seem to want to mimic the things that the new Soviet Union, meaning Vladimir [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=568.74s)]
*  Putin, is doing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=572.84s)]
*  And even in our conversations about DeSantis, it's about how well they're serving him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=573.9s)]
*  The truth is dehumanization as a tactic for politics is from war. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=578.22s)]
*  Dehumanization is a tactic, it's being used right now. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  The Russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=591.22s)]
*  Dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=597.38s)]
*  So just to be clear, and by the way, there's clearly some kind of inverse IQ test going [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=602.1s)]
*  on in the hiring department over at MSNBC, but here are the new rules. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=605.98s)]
*  If you would like a big publicly held corporation to pay its taxes, then you're a child rapist. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=610.08s)]
*  Obviously you're a racist, you're like Putin, which means you're a fascist, but you know [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=616.98s)]
*  what else you are? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=620.62s)]
*  According to Joy Reid, you're a communist. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=621.98s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is, quote, taking us back to the Soviet Union. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=625.18s)]
*  You're a communist if you want the company to pay its taxes. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=628.26s)]
*  Now Joy Reid went to Harvard, so we're not going to disagree with her, but we did feel [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=631.38s)]
*  a moral obligation to check that fact because it's a heavy claim. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1JdUXLWUo&t=634.7s)]
