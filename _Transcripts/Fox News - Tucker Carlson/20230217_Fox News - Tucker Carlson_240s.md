# Tucker roasts Don Lemon's morning show: It's like a super dysfunctional family!
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU)
*  So today a small number of passengers stuck in airport lounges across the country looked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=0.0s)]
*  up at one of those televisions bolts of the ceiling and noticed something weird. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=4.88s)]
*  Don Lamon, the star of CNN this morning, was not at work. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=8.88s)]
*  And to be fair, sometimes a vacation is just a vacation, but we can't help notice that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=14.52s)]
*  Don Lamon's absence comes just a day after he laid bare his utter contempt once again [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=18.54s)]
*  for his co-anchors, Poppy Harlow and Caitlin Collins. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Now the passive aggressive schtick is pretty fine-tuned and also getting kind of obvious. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=28.7s)]
*  Lamon pretends to attack Republicans, yesterday it was Nikki Haley, as a way of attacking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=34.06s)]
*  his co-hosts. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=38.96s)]
*  He thinks he's getting away with it, but yesterday morning he made his disdain a little too obvious. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=39.96s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=45.34s)]
*  I think it's the wrong road to go down. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=46.34s)]
*  She says people, you know, politicians or something are not in their prime. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=47.9s)]
*  Nikki Haley isn't in her prime. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=50.86s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=52.34s)]
*  A woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=53.34s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=56.9s)]
*  That's not according to me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=58.14s)]
*  Prime for what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=59.14s)]
*  It depends. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=60.14s)]
*  I mean, it's just like prime. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=61.14s)]
*  If you look it up, if you Google when is a woman in her prime, it'll say 20s, 30s and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=62.14s)]
*  40s. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=67.34s)]
*  I don't necessarily. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=68.34s)]
*  Oh, I got another decade. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=69.34s)]
*  And that's when I agree with that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=70.34s)]
*  So I think she has to be careful about saying that politicians aren't in their prime in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=71.34s)]
*  their 20s. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=75.42s)]
*  I think they need to qualify. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=76.42s)]
*  Are you talking about prime for like child rearing or are you talking about prime for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=77.42s)]
*  being president? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=80.42s)]
*  Don't shoot the message or I'm just saying what the facts are. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=81.42s)]
*  Google it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=82.42s)]
*  It's always like some super dysfunctional family on that set with the drunk guy, dad, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=83.86s)]
*  Don LaMond dad. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=92.5s)]
*  But we want to take it seriously. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=93.5s)]
*  Don LaMond said, well, he got this from Google. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  So we went to Google and we typed in an obvious request. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=97.1s)]
*  Show us the quintessential specimen in his prime. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to tell you what we found. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=106.86s)]
*  We're not going to hide the results. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=107.86s)]
*  Full transparency on this show. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=109.34s)]
*  It did not take us long to come across pictures of Don LaMond himself looking like the international [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=110.98s)]
*  sex symbol he is at the age of 56. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=117.54s)]
*  Look at this man. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=119.98s)]
*  Look at those clothes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=121.22s)]
*  This is a is that a cape? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=123.34s)]
*  No, it's got arms, but it could be a cape. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  I mean, is that bold? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=126.66s)]
*  He's a fashion icon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  Then we came across these Instagram posts showing Don LaMond on the runway a few weeks [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=134.9s)]
*  We don't want to use the word fabulous, but is there another word to describe it? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=135.9s)]
*  No, there's not. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=137.54000000000002s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, fabulous Don LaMond. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  It's just so great. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=140.62s)]
*  And the word sassy does comes to mind too. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=151.82s)]
*  In their prime, Don LaMond is in his prime right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  His lived experience is being too sexy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=158.62s)]
*  Was this whole segment a roundabout way for Don LaMond to get everyone to Google pictures [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=163.1s)]
*  of Don LaMond? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=166.86s)]
*  We can't say. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=167.86s)]
*  But as you can imagine, the morning meeting today at CNN was awkward. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=169.58s)]
*  CNN forced Mr. LaMond to zoom in the meeting from Miami, where he has been frolicking shirtless [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=173.06s)]
*  on the beach, looking very much, not coincidentally, like a man in his prime. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=178.5s)]
*  And his apology, he read what appeared to be a cliche about women. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=184.46s)]
*  He Googled about three minutes before between Bellini's, here it is, quote, I believe that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=188.9s)]
*  women of any age can do whatever they set their minds to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=193.5s)]
*  And you can just imagine in your mind the ladies of the view holding him at gunpoint. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=199.34s)]
*  Say it Don, say it! [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=204.14s)]
*  At any age, an 80 year old can give birth! [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=205.14s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't heartfelt, not reality based. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=209.9s)]
*  It was kind of ridiculous. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=214.14s)]
*  If you're going to grovel, do it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=215.14s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=216.62s)]
*  And apparently his coworkers and managers at CNN are mad. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=217.62s)]
*  We're hoping he comes back. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=221.9s)]
*  If we lose Don LaMond, we've lost a major wellspring of comedy in this country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BR-GTVTCQU&t=223.26s)]
