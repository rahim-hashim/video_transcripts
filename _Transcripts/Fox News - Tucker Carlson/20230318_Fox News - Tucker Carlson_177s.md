# Entrepreneur tells Tucker only 1% of people are willing to do this one thing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY)
*  If you're an 18 year old American and you're thinking about going to college, become a doctor or a vet or architect, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=0.0s)]
*  probably not a bad idea. But if you don't know what you want to study, you might not want to go to college in the first place. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  But how do you think about what you should do? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=12.56s)]
*  Well, a man called Ken Rusk, who's a business owner and advocate for blue collar jobs, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=14.56s)]
*  made a lot of money in blue collar jobs, has thought a lot about how to make those decisions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=20.48s)]
*  We sat down with him for a new episode of Chuckle Carlson Today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  And he told us, here's how young people should think about their lives. Interesting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=27.92s)]
*  Nobody ever looks at somebody and says, I'm totally interested in what your future looks like to you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=39.68s)]
*  Okay, I want to see you break your future down into a million little pieces, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  and then get those pieces one little step at a time. And here's how we're going to do it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=50.8s)]
*  So I want you to draw what your favorite house might look like. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=54.96s)]
*  Then I want you to draw your favorite mode of transportation, car, bike, truck, whatever. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Then I want you to draw your favorite give back moment, your charity moment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=64.16s)]
*  If you had an extra hundred bucks, what would you do with it? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=67.84s)]
*  Time, talent and treasure. What would you give away, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Now I want you to draw your favorite pet, dog, cat, what color, what would you name it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=73.28s)]
*  Let's talk about your favorite vacation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=77.68s)]
*  Now I want you to draw your health moment and your spiritual moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's draw this out on a poster board and keep it in front of you because, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=83.68s)]
*  Tucker, only 1% of the population is willing to go that far. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  So why shouldn't I be the employer who says, I'm going to force the issue [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=92.72000000000001s)]
*  and turn you into a 1% person, right? Because so many people, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  8 out of 10 people can't name a goal that they have for themselves. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  The other 2 out of 10, or let's say 20 out of 100, 16 of those never write their goals down. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=106.56s)]
*  Four of them do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=113.2s)]
*  Only one of them writes them down and puts those up on the wall so they can see them every day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=114.48s)]
*  Well, that's what I do. I said, if you're going to work here, if you're going to spend your time [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  here, if you're going to earn money here because it's hard, then you should reward yourself and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  benefit from this. So let's put something out there that you can see the progress of you gaining [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=127.12s)]
*  the picture that is called your life. It's like a puzzle and you just start filling it in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=132.32s)]
*  And I got to tell you, after they get their first goal, I don't care if it's paying off a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  low-balance visa card, get out of the way because they go crazy. They become goal-oriented [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=142.0s)]
*  machines after that. And it's only because they see themselves gaining on their own life, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=147.84s)]
*  regardless of what you're doing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=152.4s)]
*  That man is Ken Rusk. He took what is now considered an unconventional path. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=155.6s)]
*  Might be coming back into fashion. That conversation is on Fox Nation right now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF67y_rJhiY&t=160.16s)]
