# Travel hell: Woman tells Tucker about 37-hour train nightmare
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A)
*  So air travel is a disaster under the man who's supposed to fix air travel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=0.0s)]
*  But it's not just air travel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=4.8s)]
*  Have you ridden on a train recently? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=6.8s)]
*  Have you really? Have you ridden on a train? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Well on Monday of this week at 5 p.m. passengers in Virginia got on an Amtrak bound for Orlando, the car train. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  They're supposed to arrive by 10 a.m. on Tuesday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=17.76s)]
*  But they didn't. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=20.96s)]
*  Instead they were stuck on that train for 37 hours. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Because Amtrak, part of our transportation system, could not figure out how to navigate around a derailment. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Some passengers called the police thinking they'd been taken hostage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=34.96s)]
*  Once again, for those of you that are calling the police, we are not holding you hostage. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=39.76s)]
*  We are giving you all the information which we have. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=46.0s)]
*  We are sorry about the inconvenience. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  As soon as more information is available, we will let you know shortly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=51.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=58.24s)]
*  We'd like you to know that we're not holding you hostage. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=61.36s)]
*  We have all the information, quote, in which we have. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=65.36s)]
*  Excuse me. That's our transportation system. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=70.08s)]
*  It's probably not funny if you were caught on that train. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=72.08s)]
*  Colleen McKenna was. She's one of the travelers who was stuck on a stinking Amtrak train for 37 hours. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=74.08s)]
*  Colleen, I'm sorry to laugh. It must have been horrible. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for joining us tonight. What was that like? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  It was just, honestly, just extremely frustrating just because of the lack of information from Amtrak. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  I woke up about 6 a.m. on Tuesday and we were stopped in North Carolina and I spoke with one of my attendants. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  And he just said that there was a derailment of a train in front of us, so we're going to have to take a detour. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  I have no idea when we're going to arrive in Sanford. My best guess is later on this evening. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  So they just had no idea what was going on the entire time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=108.88s)]
*  Now trains, and correct me if I'm wrong, but they're on tracks, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=114.56s)]
*  They can't just veer off into the woods and get lost. I mean, they run on metal rails. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=118.56s)]
*  No. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=122.56s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=124.56s)]
*  So at least that's the way it used to work. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=126.56s)]
*  How could a train not have, quote, information about where it's going? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=128.56s)]
*  I don't know. At one point, we moved to South Carolina and we were stuck there for 6 hours. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=134.56s)]
*  They told us that they needed to switch over crews and one should be arriving at around 5.30. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=142.72s)]
*  5.30 came around and we got an update and they said that they're unsure where this crew is and they don't know when we're going to be here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=146.72s)]
*  So the next update we got was around 7 o'clock where they said it would be two more hours for them to get to us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=154.72s)]
*  Were you heartened or confused when they announced on the PA system that they were, quote, not holding you hostage? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=160.72s)]
*  I thought it was funny, but I did understand people's concern because there was no way off of the train. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=166.88s)]
*  We were stuck in the middle of nowhere in South Carolina and there wasn't an option to go outside. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=172.88s)]
*  So we were locked in, but I didn't feel unsafe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=178.88s)]
*  Did anyone try to make a break for it? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=182.88s)]
*  Not that I'm aware of, but it could have been possible. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=186.88s)]
*  So I have to ask, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want because it's a sensitive question, but there's been a lot of concern about racism, misogyny, and transphobia in our transportation system. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=191.04s)]
*  Did you notice any of those things on the Amtrak train? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=203.04s)]
*  I didn't. I was a little isolated on the train just because I had a private room. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=207.04s)]
*  So the most interaction I got was when I was having my meals, but when I was around other people, I didn't notice anything significant. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=211.04s)]
*  Well, I think Pete Putta-Judges is going to count that as a win. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=219.2s)]
*  So I appreciate your coming on. I'm glad you're off the train, Colleen. Glad you weren't held hostage. Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=223.2s)]
*  I'm glad I'm here. Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqSKL9OT9A&t=227.2s)]
