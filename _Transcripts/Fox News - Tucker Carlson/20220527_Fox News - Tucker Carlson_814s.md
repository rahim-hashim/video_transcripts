# Tucker Carlson: Elizabeth Warren's latest plan to make herself more powerful
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU)
*  Good evening and welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight. When was the last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=0.0s)]
*  time you heard a democratic politician propose a solution to a problem, no matter what the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=4.8s)]
*  problem is, that didn't make the democratic party more powerful? Ponder that for a moment. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=9.24s)]
*  Let's say for example that you really believe global warming was an existential threat to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=16.0s)]
*  humanity and that rising carbon dioxide levels were causing global warming. What would you [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  do to fix it? Well you might think back to 10th grade biology class. CO2, CO2, CO2, CO2, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=24.12s)]
*  don't trees consume huge amounts of CO2 for photosynthesis? Quick Google check. Why yes they [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=30.64s)]
*  do. So how about we plant a whole lot more trees all across the country and across the world? That [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=37.32s)]
*  seems like a natural solution with lots of upsides. Trees are beautiful. It might help [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  fight global warming. Oh but no, there's a problem with that idea. Planting more trees might help [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=48.72s)]
*  solve climate change but it definitely will not enrich your donors. Trees are cheap. It's hard to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=54.76s)]
*  make money from trees and worse than that trees are impossible to regulate. Once you plant trees [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=60.0s)]
*  they grow by themselves. They do not need federal help. Trees definitely will not make you more [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=64.96s)]
*  powerful. So instead here's an idea. Let's invest trillions of dollars of other people's money in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=69.8s)]
*  batteries and wind farms and electric school buses. That way democratic politicians get [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=75.68s)]
*  fingertip control over the entire US economy and all of their friends get rich. Sounds perfect. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=80.32s)]
*  Let's go with that idea. That's how democratic politicians think. Every one of them. So it [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=86.0s)]
*  probably should not surprise you that Elizabeth Warren has a brand new plan for rising gas prices [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  and naturally it goes without saying that plan would give Elizabeth Warren a lot more control [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  over you and over the United States. Well hold on a minute you may be wondering. Why should Elizabeth [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=101.44s)]
*  Warren have control over anything? Elizabeth Warren isn't very bright. She's never created [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=106.88s)]
*  anything. In fact she's a proven liar. This is a person who exploited the suffering of American [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=111.92s)]
*  Indians to get a job promotion. The Trail of Tears means I need tenure. Okay so in every possible way [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren is mediocre. Yet and here's the catch she's also a US Senator and that means she [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  has power. Warren's latest plan to make herself more powerful is called the Price Gouging Prevention [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=129.8s)]
*  Act of 2022. This bill would allow Elizabeth Warren to decide what things cost in the United [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=135.0s)]
*  States. So let's say you're paying six bucks a gallon for gas and you may be. The obvious solution [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=141.08s)]
*  to that, in fact the only solution to that, is to make more gasoline because if there is more of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=146.64s)]
*  something it will cost less. That's not just basic economics though it is it's also a law of nature. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=151.8s)]
*  It never changes. But Elizabeth Warren wants the opposite. She does not want more gas. In fact she's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=157.32s)]
*  worked hard to prevent the United States from producing more gasoline and that's the main reason [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=162.2s)]
*  it's so expensive. What Elizabeth Warren wants instead is control over gasoline and over everything [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=166.0s)]
*  else and this bill will give it to her. See how this works? And this is why the Biden administration [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=172.0s)]
*  has shut down oil and gas leases in the middle of an energy crisis and not just that they're crushing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=178.0s)]
*  refineries. According to one analysis by Hot Air quote, seven American refineries which formerly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=183.64s)]
*  processed 806,000 barrels of oil per day have gone offline. Some simply shut down while others [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=189.52s)]
*  were being converted to biofuels like ethanol to meet the demands of the environmental lobby. These [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=196.08s)]
*  losses have left the United States with 124 operating oil refineries. That is 10% fewer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  refineries for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel than we had in 2016 even as demand has continued to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=207.72s)]
*  increase. End quote. So you see how this is going. No more oil or gas for you and that's why you can't [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=213.92s)]
*  afford to fill your tank. Instead the Biden administration is demanding that states build [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=221.64s)]
*  wind turbines that sound good but unfortunately don't actually work. Last year we went to Texas [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  to see this firsthand. Here's a clip from our documentary on the tragic buffoonery of wind power. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  With no chance of being approved near Malibu or Greenwich or in the mountains of Aspen, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=236.76s)]
*  the development invariably happens in poorer parts of the country. The number one place for wind farms [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=243.24s)]
*  is Texas but the question is what happens when the turbines stop spinning? We're in the middle of nowhere [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  in Texas. We're trying to find a place just to sleep tonight. Everything is sold out. There's nothing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=254.84s)]
*  available. It's now expected to be the largest insurance claim event in Texas history. This [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=260.68s)]
*  winter storm totally overwhelmed the power system in Texas. I can tell you this morning nearly 4.2 [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=266.16s)]
*  million Texans still have no electricity. Texas has the most wind power capacity in the United [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  States but the Texas turbines which are not winterized iced up during a cold weather event [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=277.52s)]
*  in February of 2021. Electricity output collapsed. Texas regulators ordered rolling blackouts Monday [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=283.2s)]
*  as an Arctic blasts frozen wind turbines. There's no water in the hotel. The Texas grid like the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=290.24s)]
*  California grid is becoming increasingly unreliable and difficult to maintain, difficult to keep that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=295.2s)]
*  power in a steady basis. This 20-year-old turbine is leaking oil. It doesn't look too green to me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=301.6s)]
*  So the point of an energy grid is to produce and transmit energy. It has only one purpose and that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=313.12s)]
*  purpose is being sabotaged on purpose by the Biden administration and by Wall Street in favor of green [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=320.0s)]
*  energy, in favor of windmills that don't actually work. And as a result of that we're facing the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=326.48s)]
*  prospect of more blackouts this summer. We don't have electricity anymore. It's a first world country [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=331.04s)]
*  but Elizabeth Warren has a fix for that quote. It shall be unlawful for a person to sell or offer [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  for sale a good or services at an unconscionably excessive price during an exceptional market shock [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  regardless of the person's position in the supply chain or distribution network. So the argument here [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=347.12s)]
*  this is Elizabeth Warren's argument. The economy has been in a period of exceptional market shock [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  since the pandemic began. Therefore prices set by every industry across the country would fall [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=356.88s)]
*  under the regulatory authority of who? Elizabeth Warren. Most of the price gouging bills are limited [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=361.6s)]
*  to specific areas during natural disasters but this one is not. It's economy wide and it's forever. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=367.6s)]
*  Now the question is how exactly does Elizabeth Warren define quote unconscionably excessive [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=372.88s)]
*  prices because they're not defined in the legislation. So it turns out the definition is up to can you [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=377.84s)]
*  guess Elizabeth Warren. Any business with gross annual revenues over a hundred grand a year that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=382.88s)]
*  means pretty much everybody in the country must now obey Elizabeth Warren. That means Elizabeth [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=389.2s)]
*  Warren read the power to say set the price of say diesel fuel. That's what we use to fuel trucks that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=396.48s)]
*  transport virtually everything that you buy or consume. The entire US economy depends on diesel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=401.2s)]
*  As CBS reported recently diesel prices are getting close to the point where truckers [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=407.28s)]
*  can't work anymore. Watch. Disaster-dousing fuel price is like six dollars and thirty nine cents a [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=411.68s)]
*  gallon. Imagine paying that for a fill up of more than 100 gallons. A regular fill up would have been [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=418.0s)]
*  just say six months ago about seven hundred dollars. Now it's about a thousand. It's what [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=425.6s)]
*  truckers are facing across the country for diesel and you're paying the price according to oil [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=434.48s)]
*  analyst Tom Clueson. If you're ordering anything that moves by freight across the country it comes [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=439.92s)]
*  via fuel surcharges. Probably not the worst of the diesel surcharges. That'll come next month. I just [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=446.24s)]
*  don't think there's any magic bullet at the moment. It's going to be tough. It's going to be a tough [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  summer. So most projections suggest that this and by this we mean the price of energy is going to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=459.04s)]
*  get worse and that's exactly of course what Elizabeth Warren is counting on. Your suffering. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=465.6s)]
*  She hopes Americans get so desperate that they go to her to set the price of diesel along with [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  everything else that's bought or sold in the United States economy. And when that happens what happens? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=474.8s)]
*  Interesting question. So at this point a lot of money is floating around the US economy and that's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  because of government spending. Federal Reserve prints money it goes to the banks and then it [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  filters down to Wall Street and they buy bigger houses. And yet at the same time supplies of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=487.6s)]
*  essential goods are very limited. So when you impose price controls in that kind of environment [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=492.32s)]
*  anyone anyone bidding wars start and prices go up even higher. As the economist Alan Cole put it [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=497.36s)]
*  recently you will inevitably get a scalper's paradise. Government imposed prices will be low [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=503.2s)]
*  so they'll sell out fast of course. Then you get a black market. We don't have to guess because this [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=508.8s)]
*  has happened in every controlled economy in history. The Bolsheviks learned this early when [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=514.56s)]
*  they imposed price controls. So what do you do next if you're the government imposing these [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=518.88s)]
*  controls? Well you crack down on scalpers and that's what Elizabeth Warren's bill would do. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=522.8s)]
*  So you get a lot more law enforcement activity. A lot of people go into jail [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=527.36s)]
*  but you also get what the economist Gregory Grossman calls the second economy. So people do [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=531.12s)]
*  anything they can to get the government approved lower price. The Soviets traded favors and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=536.4s)]
*  established protection rackets. They call the system blot which translated from the Polish [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=541.28s)]
*  meant someone who provides cover. What you get is corruption. Corruption is the inevitable result [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=545.6s)]
*  of price controls. Even the Soviets learned this after almost 70 years. That's why Gorbachev [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=552.64s)]
*  abandoned price controls in the 1990s. Nicholas Maduro though a pretty rigorous Marxist also [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=558.24s)]
*  abandoned price controls in Venezuela. He did that three years ago. In the 1970s Richard Nixon [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=566.24s)]
*  also realized, can you imagine, price controls don't work but only after he froze all prices and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=572.4s)]
*  wages in the United States and that eventually led to a massive spike in demand and double digit [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=577.68s)]
*  inflation. So people who don't understand basic economic principles probably shouldn't fool around [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=582.56s)]
*  with the economy but they can never control themselves and that's why some of the biggest [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=587.36s)]
*  figures in the Democratic Party right now want to repeat mistakes we have seen countless times. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=592.24s)]
*  Not just Elizabeth Warren. It's the supposedly moderate Bob Casey and Sheldon Whitehouse who's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=596.16s)]
*  not very bright and Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley and Tammy Duckworth and Diane [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=601.6s)]
*  Feinstein. They're all on board with this bill and then the House you've got Jerry Nadler, David [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxjWnKiZoU&t=606.08s)]
