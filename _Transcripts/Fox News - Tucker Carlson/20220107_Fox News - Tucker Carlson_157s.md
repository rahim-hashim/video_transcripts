# This is why Harris is comparing January 6 to 9/11: Veteran
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic)
*  So at the Capitol today, as we told you, Kamala Harris, who will literally read anything that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=0.0s)]
*  arises on the teleprompter in front of her, read a script that compared January 6th to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=8.4s)]
*  Pearl Harbor and 9-11, and we're quoting, dates that occupy not only a place in our [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=14.6s)]
*  calendars, but a place in our collective memory. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=18.88s)]
*  December 7th, 1941, September 11th, 2001, and January 6th, 2020. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=21.96s)]
*  So, you know, it's easy to mock that it's obviously ludicrous, but it's also maybe if [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=27.84s)]
*  you fought this country's wars more than ludicrous, maybe it's offensive. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Joe Kent has fought this country's wars for many years as a career soldier. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=37.92s)]
*  He's now running for Congress in Washington state. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=41.96s)]
*  We wish him well in that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Joe Kent, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  So what was your reaction when you heard the Vice President of the United States say this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=47.84s)]
*  Well, obviously, Tucker, I was deeply offended because it's absolutely appalling and just [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  completely ridiculous. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=56.64s)]
*  But what I want people to realize is exactly what she's doing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=58.24s)]
*  Like you said, I fought these wars before and I've seen this playbook ran before. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=61.04s)]
*  What Kamala Harris is doing, what Joe Biden is doing, is they're taking very powerful [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=65.6s)]
*  imagery and they're saying that the attack on Pearl Harbor, the attack on 9-11, this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=69.92s)]
*  is the same thing that took place on January 6th, because that allows people to compare [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=74.16s)]
*  Trump supporters to Nazis, to actual members of Al-Qaeda. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=78.32s)]
*  And with that imagery comes the justification to turn the tools of the state against them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=82.3s)]
*  I can't believe you're running for Congress. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=87.62s)]
*  That is such a smart and obvious analysis, and I wish I had said it before you said it, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=89.82s)]
*  but I think that's exactly right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=95.06s)]
*  These words are not chosen by accident, correct? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=96.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=100.08s)]
*  No, these are very deliberate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=101.08s)]
*  Like I said, we've seen this playbook before. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=102.08s)]
*  There are echoes to the lead up to the Iraq War that they have some intelligence. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=103.78s)]
*  There's something they can't tell us, but we have to trust them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=107.94s)]
*  It's very, very dangerous, but therefore we have to give them the authorities to send [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=111.74s)]
*  us into a war, a new war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=115.1s)]
*  But that war is here and that war is against the deplorables, Trump supporters, whatever [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=116.82s)]
*  you want to call it, and that war has allowed them to deprive our citizens of their constitutional [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=120.78s)]
*  rights, those that are still sitting in a gulag in Washington, D.C., deprived of their [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=125.38s)]
*  rights, and then even other Americans who dissent from the current regime's narrative [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=129.38s)]
*  just look no further than what they did to the parents that had the audacities to show [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=133.74s)]
*  up to school board meetings. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=137.5s)]
*  They had the FBI counter-terrorism centers turned against them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=138.58s)]
*  No wonder Liz Cheney is for this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  So interesting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=145.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=146.62s)]
*  Dick Cheney showed up magically again today, making a great reappearance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=147.62s)]
*  So there's no coincidence there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  It's all so wrong. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  Joe Kent, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKSR-vQMnic&t=155.74s)]
