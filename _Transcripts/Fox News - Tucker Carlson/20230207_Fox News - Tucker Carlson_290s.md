# Tucker: This practice is illegal
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA)
*  So the point of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as you often heard, is to wind up with a leadership [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=0.0s)]
*  class that, quote, looks like America. Now, we think you should hire on the basis of merit, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=5.36s)]
*  but that's kind of an appealing idea. The people who run the country should look like the country. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=12.56s)]
*  That's not what it's about at all, because no administration has ever looked less like America [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=17.76s)]
*  just by the numbers than the Biden administration. It's not about making the administration look [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=23.6s)]
*  like America. It's about discriminating against certain classes of people who don't vote for them, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=27.44s)]
*  period. And now it's provable. Jeremy Carl at the Claremont Institute just ran the numbers, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  and this is in the judiciary. He found that out of 97 federal judges confirmed under Joe Biden, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=36.32s)]
*  total number of white men, five. Twenty-two are black women. So this is race-based hiring. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  It's illegal, but it's also not about looking like America. It's about punishing people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=49.52s)]
*  And it's also incidentally, or maybe not incidentally, producing nominees [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=55.76s)]
*  for federal judgeships who know nothing about the Constitution, like this person. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Judge, on the far end, tell me what Article 5 of the Constitution does. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=64.88s)]
*  Article 5 is not coming to mind at the moment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Okay. How about Article 2? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=80.96s)]
*  Neither is Article 2. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=86.56s)]
*  She doesn't know what's in the Constitution, but she's going to be a federal judge whose job it is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  to interpret the law against the Constitution. Okay. So degrading. Horace Cooper is the co-chairman [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=94.56s)]
*  of Project 21. He's also a lawyer who knows what's in the Constitution. Horace, thanks so much for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=99.36s)]
*  coming on. By the way, I'm not a lawyer. I don't even have a successful background in academia, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  and I knew what those were. So like, that's pretty bad, right? Why is this not on the front page of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  the New York Times? Well, it should have been, Tucker. You know, I actually taught an Article 1 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=115.28s)]
*  course, all about the legislative process, at George Mason University. And it's important that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=121.6s)]
*  people understand what the options, what the authorities, what the powers that our founders [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=128.24s)]
*  granted our Congress, our federal legislature, and we had an entire course focused on that. But [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=134.72s)]
*  George Mason, like other good schools, wants quality graduates. We want talented graduates, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=143.92s)]
*  and we're interested in seeing to it that the people who leave with a degree are masters of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  the topic. What we're seeing from the Biden administration, and which is what we're seeing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  generally from the progressive movement, is this idea that we just need to reshape the judiciary [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=169.44s)]
*  in a way under color. I use that term in a duplicative way, by pretending that we're making [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=181.12s)]
*  the courts look more like America. But the truth of the matter is, we're finding people, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=190.56s)]
*  they aren't talented, they aren't highly skilled, but they know progressive vision, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=198.0s)]
*  just like the back of their hand. That's the ultimate goal of what's happening here, not [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  excellence. And America suffers, corporations suffers, defendants suffer. Well, it is just so [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=211.52s)]
*  unbelievably degrading, I think, for the whole country. It's the opposite of excellence. And I [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  appreciate your saying so. Horace Cooper, great to see you. Sorry, go ahead. I was just going to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=223.12s)]
*  say, we set up this independent judiciary as a way for every American, instead of self-help, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=228.0s)]
*  which is the nasty way of saying, I'm not going to rely on the legal or the justice system, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=237.84s)]
*  we set up, our founders set up this independent judiciary so that we can get people to voluntarily [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=242.8s)]
*  agree to bring their disputes there. I don't want the cardiologist to be chosen by his color. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=251.12s)]
*  I don't want the pilot to be chosen by his race. And I don't want the judiciary to be chosen that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=261.36s)]
*  way. We need excellence. And this administration doesn't want that. Amen. Great to see you tonight. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Horace. Thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqneBAyqLA&t=277.2s)]
