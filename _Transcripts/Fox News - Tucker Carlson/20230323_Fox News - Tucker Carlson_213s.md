# Guest warns Tucker that US taxpayer money is funding a China-linked business
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc)
*  So China is buying up land across the country, including ag land. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=0.0s)]
*  But some states, this is so perverse, it's hard to believe it's real, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=4.54s)]
*  are helping the Chinese government replace American manufacturing as well. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=7.34s)]
*  The governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has gave more than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=12.98s)]
*  700 million dollars in taxpayer money to fund a massive [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=15.22s)]
*  Chinese battery plant in Big Rapids, Michigan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=19.46s)]
*  Residents there are protesting this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=22.82s)]
*  Tudor Dixon ran for governor of Michigan. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=24.42s)]
*  She's host of the Tudor Dixon podcast, and we are honored to have her [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=27.12s)]
*  join us tonight. Tudor Dixon, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=30.1s)]
*  This is one of the stories. It's hard to believe it's real. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=32.5s)]
*  How could Gretchen Whitmer have gotten away with this? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=34.54s)]
*  Well, how did she get away with this? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=38.4s)]
*  But how is it not a bigger story? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=40.04s)]
*  What we've recently found out, because we gave the state of Michigan, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=41.6s)]
*  lawmakers and Gretchen Whitmer have decided to give this company [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=45.78s)]
*  715 million in taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=49.06s)]
*  But in the company bylaws that are on the company website, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=51.28s)]
*  it clearly states that when they get to Michigan, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=55.36s)]
*  they have to have a CCP organization on site, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=58.22s)]
*  a Chinese Communist Party organization on site, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  a propaganda arm of the CCP right in the center of the country in Michigan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=65.76s)]
*  One square mile of CCP in the center of Michigan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  And that has to influence the grassroots of the corporation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=73.84s)]
*  So think about that. They have to have the CCP there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=77.6s)]
*  This is in the bylaws. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=80.84s)]
*  Clearly, the lawmakers and Gretchen Whitmer read these bylaws. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=82.38s)]
*  You would have to say you would have to know what the company's operations [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=86.24s)]
*  are going to be. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=90.24s)]
*  This is nowhere near any of our car manufacturers, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=91.44s)]
*  any of our automobile manufacturers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=94.38s)]
*  So what exactly are they doing in this rural area in Michigan? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=96.26s)]
*  But to top it off, we now know that about 250 to 300 [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=100.2s)]
*  will be housed at the local university. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  They're Chinese nationals. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=107.1s)]
*  These are not going to be American jobs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=108.74s)]
*  They're bringing Chinese nationals in to take these jobs, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=110.7s)]
*  and they will be housed at the local university, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=114.3s)]
*  where the local university has just so happened to be telling people, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=116.8s)]
*  this is such a good idea. You have to have this corporation here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=120.1s)]
*  So how much money are the Chinese going to give the local university? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=123.33999999999999s)]
*  And Gretchen Whitmer, who strikes me as extraordinarily corrupt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=128.18s)]
*  I mean, someone got paid for this. Do we know who? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=131.18s)]
*  Well, we need to find that out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=133.48s)]
*  But obviously, lots of people are involved in this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  You have lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  But you have Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  And we have said from the very beginning, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=141.16s)]
*  this is suspect. And now you have the community rising up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=143.74s)]
*  So Big Rapids actually said, you know what? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=146.48s)]
*  We don't want this in our in our town. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=148.88s)]
*  We don't we want this to move out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=151.54s)]
*  Goshen said we're going to move to the town next door. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=153.22s)]
*  They're still pushing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=155.42s)]
*  You still see local people coming up and saying, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  this does not make sense for us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=159.46s)]
*  We don't want the the arm of the Chinese Communist Party right here in our small town. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=161.06s)]
*  But think about this. This is truly an organization. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=165.64s)]
*  It clearly states it has to be the Chinese Communist Party [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=169.36s)]
*  setting up in the middle of the country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=172.86s)]
*  You're surrounded by Wisconsin has an Air Force base. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=175.72s)]
*  You have a lot of opportunity to spy on the United States [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=179.86s)]
*  if you're right in the center of the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=183.46s)]
*  And they're writing, clearly stating that they are spying on the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=185.3s)]
*  I mean, it's Michigan, a state that used to build things. Right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  The self-respect is gone. It's so sad to see. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=195.28s)]
*  Tudor Dixon, it's great to see you tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=197.34s)]
*  Thank you for that amazing story. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=199.34s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6aS5CYcPc&t=200.73999999999998s)]
