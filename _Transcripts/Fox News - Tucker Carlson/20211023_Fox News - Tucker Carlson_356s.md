# What went wrong in Alec Baldwin prop gun accident?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I)
*  Authorities say that actor Alec Baldwin shot and killed a woman on the set of his upcoming film Rust in New Mexico. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=0.0s)]
*  The woman was the film's cinematographer. The director was also wounded. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=7.76s)]
*  According to the Stage Actors Union, Baldwin's prop gun contained, quote, a single live round. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=12.56s)]
*  Court documents state that before fatal shooting, Alec Baldwin was handed a loaded gun on the film set by a director who wasn't aware it was loaded. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=18.72s)]
*  Fox News Digital has just obtained a 911 call from a script supervisor on the set, and the script supervisor can be heard blaming an assistant director for failing to make sure the prop gun was safe. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=28.4s)]
*  Here's a part of that call. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=41.36s)]
*  So was it loaded with a real bullet or one? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=43.36s)]
*  I cannot tell you that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=45.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=47.36s)]
*  We have two injuries from a movie gun shot. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=48.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=52.36s)]
*  We're getting them out there already. Just stay on the phone with me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=53.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=55.36s)]
*  This is a man that yelled at me at lunch with the African about revisions. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=57.72s)]
*  Did you see him? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=62.72s)]
*  He yelled at me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=63.72s)]
*  He's supposed to check the gun. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=65.72s)]
*  He's responsible. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=67.72s)]
*  Deadline is now reporting that there had been a recent accidental discharge of the prop gun on the set, and the L.A. Times is reporting that crew members walked off the set just hours before the shooting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=69.72s)]
*  One crew member was reportedly complaining about gun safety. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=80.72s)]
*  Tim Clementi is a Hollywood technical consultant and former FBI special agent, and he joins us now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=85.08s)]
*  So, Tim, on a legitimate movie set with safety protocols when you're dealing with a prop gun, what would go into something like using a gun during the filming? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=90.08s)]
*  The first thing, Jesse, is always the safety rules. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=103.08s)]
*  There's four rules of firearm safety that you follow with any gun. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=108.08s)]
*  Treat every weapon as if it's loaded. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=111.44s)]
*  Never point a gun at anything you're not willing to kill or destroy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=114.44s)]
*  Never put your finger on the trigger unless you're willing to kill or destroy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=117.44s)]
*  And always be aware of what's in front of, behind and around your target. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=120.44s)]
*  All four of those rules were violated on that movie set. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=123.44s)]
*  And if you follow those rules, nobody's in danger and nobody gets hurt. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=126.44s)]
*  And I don't know that Alec Baldwin is to blame, the producers, the A.D. that that woman mentioned, the assistant director. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=129.44s)]
*  There's probably a whole host of people, because this is a cascading set of issues that led to this happening. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=136.8s)]
*  Clearly, it wasn't just Alec having the gun in his hand. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=145.8s)]
*  It was him not knowing that it was possibly loaded, him not treating it like it was loaded. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=148.8s)]
*  And, you know, he bears a little bit of responsibility as a producer on set to make sure these things are being done. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=153.8s)]
*  And clearly they weren't. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=158.8s)]
*  So one round, I guess, wounded one person and killed another. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Are you thinking it was some sort of ricochet situation? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, generally the director and the director of photography are in very close proximity to each other on the set. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  They're usually right next to the camera or right behind the camera or somewhere very close by. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  And it's possible that it was one round, but possibly not a bullet. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  There could have been something else, another shell casing that was in the gun. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=189.52s)]
*  I understand since this is, I guess, a period piece, that it's most likely that it was a revolver. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=192.52s)]
*  And so it is possible that the wrong caliber was put in first or something else was introduced into the chamber, which was still in the chamber. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  And then a blank was put into the cylinder. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  The cylinder rotates, the gun fires, and whatever's in that barrel can be projected down the barrel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  And it could fragment and hit two people at the same time, or it could literally go through one person into the other. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  And it looks like sloppiness because there was another incident, apparently days earlier, where there was a discharge situation that people were concerned about. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  And you know, investigators are going to look at everything. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=230.88s)]
*  They're going to look at sloppiness. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=233.88s)]
*  They're going to look at sabotage. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=234.88s)]
*  I think everything is on the table here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=236.88s)]
*  I don't have a loaded weapon on a set like that and treat it that cavalierly without multiple protocols being violated. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=239.24s)]
*  It's just such a tragedy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=250.24s)]
*  And I don't see any sort of real explanation besides little leaks that we're hearing throughout the day. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=252.24s)]
*  In your opinion, and you're familiar with this kind of situation, what does your gut tell you about what happened? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=261.6s)]
*  Well, I think, again, there's a failure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=272.6s)]
*  They're supposed to be a prop master. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=274.6s)]
*  There's usually an armorer whenever you have weapons on set. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=276.6s)]
*  Both of those people are very responsible, ordinarily, and they would be the person that you would go to with the weapon before and after you're going to use it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=278.6s)]
*  So somebody should have handed the actor, in this case Alec Baldwin, a weapon and said, Alec, this is loaded. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't point it at anybody. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't put your finger on the trigger. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  When you shoot it, make sure you're pointing it in a safe direction. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  It's got a blank in it and this, you know, it can still cause harm. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  And then Alec should have recognized that once the shot is done, the gun is taken away by the prop master, the armorer, whoever is responsible on set. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  Clearly, there was none of that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  Apparently, during a rehearsal, he was holding the gun in his hand. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know if this accident occurred during the rehearsal or during an actual scene they were filming. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=316.32s)]
*  But either way, there's, as I said, there's several people that are responsible. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=322.32s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons we're not hearing a lot of detail coming out is because there could be criminal liability. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=326.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=332.32s)]
*  I don't disparage any of the people involved as individuals. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=334.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=338.32s)]
*  But there are ramifications when something like this happens and unfortunately, it can be criminal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=340.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=344.68s)]
*  And according to the 911 call, it looks like it wasn't the armorer or the prop master that handed the gun. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=346.68s)]
*  It was the assistant director. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=348.68s)]
*  So all of those things were not followed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=350.68s)]
*  Tim, thanks so much for the insight. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlUoCUcR4I&t=352.68s)]
