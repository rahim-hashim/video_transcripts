# Tucker: We've just moved one step closer to tyranny
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4)
*  So the last time a party in Congress officially designated the other party a terrorist organization, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=0.0s)]
*  we are in the middle of a civil war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=8.72s)]
*  So that hasn't happened in over 150 years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=10.92s)]
*  Typically the parties argue about things. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=14.68s)]
*  Sometimes they get mad, they call each other names. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=16.32s)]
*  Sometimes they get really mad and call each other really bad names. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=18.22s)]
*  But one thing they don't do is use law enforcement to crush, harass, arrest voters on the other [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=20.56s)]
*  side because that's not democracy, that's tyranny. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=28.88s)]
*  But we've just moved one step closer to tyranny. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=32.56s)]
*  In fact, we may already be there thanks to what the House is calling an anti-domestic [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=34.32s)]
*  terrorism bill, as if murder wasn't illegal already. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=38.72s)]
*  It just passed the House and it instructs the FBI to quote, analyze and monitor domestic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=42.28s)]
*  terrorist activity. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=48.18s)]
*  So how are we defining that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=49.18s)]
*  Well, of course we're not defining that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=50.18s)]
*  It instructs the FBI, in other words, the largest law enforcement organization in the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=52.28s)]
*  United States to monitor Joe Biden's critics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=56.36s)]
*  It dramatically expands the definition of domestic terror to include hate crimes, whatever [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=61.44s)]
*  those are. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=71.06s)]
*  It also mandates that the FBI and the DOJ conduct an assessment to determine whether [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=72.06s)]
*  white supremacists have quote, infiltrated federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=76.32s)]
*  Now, what's a white supremacist? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  They don't define that either. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=83.36s)]
*  So if you're going to pass a law that empowers people with guns to make arrests, you probably [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=86.04s)]
*  should define your terms. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=91.92s)]
*  Otherwise it will be abused unless the law was designed to be abused. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=94.4s)]
*  And this one was. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=99.48s)]
*  So under this law, these law enforcement agencies must issue biannual domestic terrorism reports [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=101.12s)]
*  to Congress with a focus on the threat, quote, posed by white supremacists and neo-Nazis [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  because it turns out the only form of race discrimination in the country comes from one [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=113.24s)]
*  group and they don't vote for Democrats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=117.8s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  That's why the bill doesn't mention BLM or T for Black Nationalists. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=121.06s)]
*  And as we said, it doesn't define white supremacy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  And that's very odd because white supremacy is the only thing lawmakers talked about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=128.16s)]
*  as they voted on this bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=132.66s)]
*  Recent white supremacist attacks have reminded minority communities across the country of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=135.6s)]
*  a dark history we have not yet escaped. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=140.0s)]
*  We have witnessed far too many other acts of domestic terrorism. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=142.96s)]
*  We are at an important crossroads in this country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=147.72s)]
*  With white supremacy on the rise and violent extremists fueling each other's bigotry and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=150.44s)]
*  hate, we're seeing an alarming increase in domestic terrorism fueled by this hatred. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  Now keep in mind when you hear people like that, and those are some of the worst and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=161.68s)]
*  most limited people in our society, but still they're elected members of Congress. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=166.28s)]
*  When you hear them attack white supremacists and white supremacy, you should know that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=169.48s)]
*  their definition of those terms is probably different from yours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=174.16s)]
*  So if you were to quote Martin Luther King Jr., whose monument stands on the mall, and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=177.16s)]
*  say that the U.S. government ought to treat people based on who they are and what they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=183.32s)]
*  do and not how they look and how they were born, should assess people on the content [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  of their character, not the color of their skin. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  If that's your position, you are by definition, according to people you just saw, a white [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  supremacist. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=196.84s)]
*  This is scary. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=199.48s)]
*  Congressman Cory Bush of Missouri spelled out the purpose of the bill, which of course [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=201.52s)]
*  is entirely political. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=205.12s)]
*  Quote, the Republican Party has become the party of unfettered white supremacist violence. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=206.56s)]
*  So there's only one Republican who voted for this bill, and that's a man who's become completely [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=213.32s)]
*  undone, and whose total destruction as a man really does deserve your pity, and that's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=218.04s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=225.2s)]
*  And that's why he said he voted for it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=226.72s)]
*  People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, you know, people like Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks, the folks [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=229.6s)]
*  you think about, they are almost leading. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=234.56s)]
*  Well, I would argue that they are leading the Republican caucus. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=237.84s)]
*  And so Kevin McCarthy, Elise Stefanik, instead of leading, as their title, leadership, should [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=241.36s)]
*  suggest they do, they basically are tolerating this all in the name of hopefully I become [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=247.44s)]
*  speaker someday. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=251.86s)]
*  You can't fundraise. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=253.06s)]
*  You can't feed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=254.36s)]
*  You can't live on fear, because eventually you're going to create fearful people, and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=255.64s)]
*  fearful people can do really bad things. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=261.08s)]
*  And I think that's what we saw in Buffalo. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=263.52s)]
*  So they're continuing to tell you, in the face of all available evidence, that the mass [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=266.36s)]
*  murder you saw over the weekend in Buffalo was inspired by hateful right-wing rhetoric, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=272.44s)]
*  when in fact that mass murderer was committed by someone with diagnosed mental illness that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=277.76s)]
*  the adults around him apparently ignored. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=283.6s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=285.8s)]
*  So you saw a shooting by a crazy person that has been hijacked by partisan forces to crush [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=286.8s)]
*  political dissent, to attack civil liberties in this country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  You should care about that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZPdehd8kk4&t=297.84000000000003s)]
