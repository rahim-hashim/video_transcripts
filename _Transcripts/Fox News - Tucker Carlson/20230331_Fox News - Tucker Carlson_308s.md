# Former Democratic gov to party: Put your country above your hatred for Trump
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE)
*  So I think it's become pretty obvious to anyone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=0.0s)]
*  who's paying close attention and being honest with himself [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=3.84s)]
*  that what you're seeing is not really a contest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=6.4s)]
*  between Republicans and Democrats, the left and right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=8.3s)]
*  It's a contest between the people in charge [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=12.68s)]
*  and everybody else. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=15.4s)]
*  It's not actually partisan in a traditional sense. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=17.56s)]
*  There's really one party on the big issue, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=19.92s)]
*  the big issues being economics and foreign policy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=22.36s)]
*  There's total agreement in Washington. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=24.72s)]
*  And so once you understand that, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=26.84s)]
*  then you can go backward into recent history [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=28.68s)]
*  and reassess a lot of the things that you saw [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=32.0s)]
*  through a very different lens. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=34.68s)]
*  And one of those things is the imprisonment [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=36.04s)]
*  of the Democratic governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=39.2s)]
*  And in retrospect, it's very obvious [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=43.28s)]
*  that he was sent to prison for political reasons, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  incarcerated for eight years on bogus corruption charges. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=48.28s)]
*  His case is a lot more interesting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=52.32s)]
*  than most people understand. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=55.2s)]
*  He's learned a lot. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=57.08s)]
*  He just responded to the indictment of Donald Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=57.9s)]
*  This is the Democratic former governor of Illinois. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=59.9s)]
*  And he wrote this, quote, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=64.14s)]
*  "'President Trump fired me, freed me, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=65.1s)]
*  "'and now he's getting effed like me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=67.5s)]
*  "'Weaponized prosecutors are destroying our country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=69.48s)]
*  "'It's time for Republicans and Democrats to stand up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=72.5s)]
*  "'and defend our constitution against third world politics.'" [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=75.18s)]
*  Really a view that speaks for probably the majority [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=80.52s)]
*  in this country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=82.62s)]
*  Rod Blagojevich, the former governor joins us now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=83.44s)]
*  Governor, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=85.94s)]
*  So tell us, Yuri, I think that tweet [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=88.42s)]
*  kind of summarizes it pretty well, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=90.42s)]
*  but expand on that a little bit, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=92.38s)]
*  given your own experience with a similar prosecution. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=93.66s)]
*  Well, I had the misfortune of being arrested [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=97.06s)]
*  as a sitting governor at six o'clock in the morning. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=98.74s)]
*  And one of my little girls, five and 12 years old, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=101.38s)]
*  were asleep, hadn't gotten up yet for school. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=104.1s)]
*  And then it was a major event, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  and I was allegedly trying to sell [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=108.34s)]
*  President-elect Obama's Senate seat. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  It was a political deal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=112.3s)]
*  Obama started the whole thing, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  and he said it wasn't necessary to me [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=114.2s)]
*  to talk about a political deal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=115.04s)]
*  The appellate court eventually reversed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=117.2s)]
*  the sale of the Senate seat. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=118.4s)]
*  It was a big lie, but Winston Churchill said, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  "'A lie can travel halfway around the world [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=120.88s)]
*  "'before the truth has a chance to put its pants on.'" [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=122.84s)]
*  And so I see what they're doing to President Trump, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=125.12s)]
*  and it's more than deja vu all over again to me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=126.88s)]
*  I don't like what they did to me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=129.88s)]
*  I would never give in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=131.34s)]
*  I fought back, and as a result, for political things. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=132.44s)]
*  No one even alleges I took a penny. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  They gave me a 14-year sentence [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=136.4s)]
*  and put me in a higher security prison [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=138.0s)]
*  where no governor's been, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  where my home was a six-foot by eight-foot prison cell, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  and I was in there with people who committed murder [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=143.48s)]
*  because they were trying to squeeze me, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=145.84s)]
*  and they gave me this long sentence, I truly believe, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  to bury me and with it the truth [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=149.48s)]
*  because it was a corrupt prosecution. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=150.88s)]
*  They tried me twice, used an unlawful standard [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  to get convictions at a second trial [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=154.44s)]
*  when they couldn't convict me [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  on their fake charges at the first trial, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  and they did it to a Democrat governor at the AAA level. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=158.76s)]
*  What they're doing now to President Trump [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=161.5s)]
*  at the major league level is not only frightening, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  but this is probably, I would say, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  the most threatening thing to our republic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=169.5s)]
*  since South Carolina fired shots at Fort Sumner [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  at the start of the Civil War. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=173.88s)]
*  This is a very serious thing, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  and I would say to my fellow Democrats, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=176.16s)]
*  I was a Democratic governor, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  the first one to endorse President Obama. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=179.04s)]
*  I supported Nancy Pelosi when I was a member of Congress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=180.72s)]
*  I would say to my fellow Democrats, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=184.28s)]
*  put your country above your hatred for Trump [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=185.68s)]
*  and be against this weaponization of prosecutions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  by political people who have uncontrolled power [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  and are gonna destroy our freedoms. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=194.76s)]
*  One thing I noticed, and thank you for saying that, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  and I hope you're not the last Democrat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=199.68s)]
*  who stands on principle and defends our system, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  but one of the things I noticed in your prosecution [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=204.66s)]
*  was that nobody defended you, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=206.84s)]
*  and once you're accused of a crime, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=208.86s)]
*  very few people stand up [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=210.84s)]
*  or even bother to assess the actual evidence. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=213.38s)]
*  I was one of them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  I had no idea what had happened to you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  It took me years to figure it out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm embarrassed by that, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  but I wonder if being accused alone [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=221.28s)]
*  isn't a kind of sentence for the person accused. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=225.96s)]
*  It's awfully hard when they accuse you like that, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=230.12s)]
*  and they did with me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  I was Roger Stone before Roger Stone. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=233.52s)]
*  They arrested me with SWAT teams around my house. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  I was a sitting governor, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=237.88s)]
*  and they did it with a massive press conference, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  and they said they were quote unquote [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=241.8s)]
*  stopping a crime spree before it happened. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=243.08s)]
*  Now, they played 1% of FBI tapes that they recorded, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=246.02s)]
*  and to this day, they're still covering up [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=248.96s)]
*  the other 99% of the tapes, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=250.32s)]
*  and in my life experience, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=252.12s)]
*  and I know for a fact what's on those tapes, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=253.56s)]
*  that the side that covers up the truth [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=255.4s)]
*  is the side that's lying, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=256.8s)]
*  and the reason they won't play those tapes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=258.0s)]
*  is because they're covering up what they did to me. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=259.58s)]
*  It was a frame up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=261.4s)]
*  It was no different from a dirty cop who plants [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=262.32s)]
*  a murder weapon in the glove compartment [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=264.48s)]
*  to frame an innocent man, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  and they did it to a governor, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=267.56s)]
*  and they felt emboldened. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=269.12s)]
*  It was a test case for them, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=270.14s)]
*  and now they're doing it to an American president, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=271.44s)]
*  and I love my country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=273.32s)]
*  It was some bad people in government that did it to me, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  and I cry from my country when I see what's happening now [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8RCzswjZE&t=277.64s)]
