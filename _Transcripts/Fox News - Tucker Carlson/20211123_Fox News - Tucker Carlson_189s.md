# Kyle Rittenhouse describes conditions in jail
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To)
*  So you're in the juvenile facility or 17, but then you turn 18, you go to Kenosha County [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=0.0s)]
*  Jail. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=3.24s)]
*  Actually, I go to Kenosha County Jail as I turn, as I'm 17. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=4.24s)]
*  I'm in adult jail. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=7.4s)]
*  At October 31st, I'm extradited, which I agree with. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=9.68s)]
*  I wanted to go to Kenosha County Jail from the beginning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=13.64s)]
*  I was extradited to Kenosha County Jail. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=16.72s)]
*  My attorney, John Pierce, said, oh, we're going to keep you in a juvenile facility. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I always want to be extradited. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=26.64s)]
*  And I had no problem with that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=29.04s)]
*  But he forgot to file the stand. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=30.28s)]
*  He didn't even know I was going. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=32.4s)]
*  So my attorney didn't know I was going to jail, which is quite sickening because he [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=35.0s)]
*  should have known. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=38.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's the whole point of an attorney. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=39.2s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=41.8s)]
*  Thank God I have competent counsel now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=42.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  But the jail was interesting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  I was in my own room. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  It was kind of like a, like a one-star. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=51.08s)]
*  I'm going to describe it as a one-star hotel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=53.76s)]
*  One-star hotel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=56.64s)]
*  We'll go with a Super 8. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=57.64s)]
*  Super 8. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=59.36s)]
*  I had a desk. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=60.36s)]
*  I had a shower. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=61.36s)]
*  I had a toilet. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=62.36s)]
*  I had a TV. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=63.36s)]
*  I had a tablet. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=64.36s)]
*  But I didn't have running water. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=68.72s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=71.0s)]
*  I had a phone also. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=72.72s)]
*  But I did not have running water, so I didn't shower until November 20th. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=73.84s)]
*  How long is that? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=79.08s)]
*  From October 31st to November 20th, I did not take a shower. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=80.08s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=83.48s)]
*  Very. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=84.48s)]
*  I smelt terrible. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=85.48s)]
*  I felt sick. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=86.48s)]
*  I lost weight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=87.48s)]
*  My health was degrading. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=88.48s)]
*  If I was in there for a month longer, I would have probably been in a hospital. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=91.12s)]
*  Wait. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=94.96s)]
*  You had no running water? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=95.96s)]
*  No running water in my jail cell. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=97.44s)]
*  Did you, did they let you out? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=101.2s)]
*  To talk with my attorneys. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=103.4s)]
*  I didn't really say anything about my running water because I'm not, I don't like to bring [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=104.92s)]
*  attention to myself. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=108.8s)]
*  I don't want to draw any problems with any of the guards. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=109.8s)]
*  So I was like, I'm just going to shut up and not mention that I don't have running water. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=113.0s)]
*  But I didn't shower until November 20th. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=118.56s)]
*  And when I showered, I took a three hour shower. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=122.08s)]
*  I had blood. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=126.52s)]
*  My skin was bleeding because my skin was coming off of my body. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=128.48s)]
*  It was just the nastiest thing ever. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=132.96s)]
*  And I feel bad for Dave, who's been with me through the beginning, who's helped start [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=135.96s)]
*  Free Kyle, USA.org. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=140.44s)]
*  I feel bad for him because he had to deal with my smell for that three hour car ride. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=143.0s)]
*  So I give him all the credit in the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=146.76s)]
*  Imagine putting that kid in jail. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=151.32s)]
*  One of the very few people in downtown Kenosha that night who was there for the right reasons, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=152.88s)]
*  who was trying to help, who was trying to bring order out of disorder, who was trying [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  to protect rather than destroy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=159.92s)]
*  And they put him in jail. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=162.0s)]
*  And the most infuriating part is the facts haven't changed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=163.0s)]
*  Videotape of that night was available almost immediately to anyone who wanted to see it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  It was very clear this man had acted, this boy had acted in self-defense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=169.76s)]
*  And they locked him up anyway because political pressure. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70N72X1_To&t=174.07999999999998s)]
