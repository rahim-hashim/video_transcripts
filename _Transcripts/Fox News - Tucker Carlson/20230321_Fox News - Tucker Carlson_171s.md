# Tucker: Why don't they want this war to end?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k)
*  Glenn Greenwald is host of System Update on Rumble. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight to assess this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=2.84s)]
*  Glenn, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=4.4s)]
*  For the second time that we know of, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=5.8s)]
*  the Biden administration has shut down any attempt [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=7.8s)]
*  to reach a brokered ceasefire. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=11.5s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=13.14s)]
*  From the very beginning, it's been clear [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=15.96s)]
*  that the U.S. wants this war to continue [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=17.56s)]
*  and wants it to go on for as long as possible [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=19.5s)]
*  because they have no interest in protecting Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  They instead want to sacrifice Ukraine, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  have Ukraine destroyed in order to advance [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=26.6s)]
*  what they think is the United States geopolitical interest [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=29.36s)]
*  of weakening Russia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=33.06s)]
*  And the way to do that is to use Ukraine as a pawn, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=34.4s)]
*  kill as many Ukrainians as possible, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=37.72s)]
*  destroy their whole country if they have to, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=39.42s)]
*  in order to prolong the war as long as possible. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=41.56s)]
*  And the response of the U.S. government and its defenders [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=43.7s)]
*  has been, we don't have any position [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=45.9s)]
*  about when the war ends. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  That's completely up to the Ukrainians. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=49.16s)]
*  When they want to end the war, they can end the war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=51.16s)]
*  If they don't, we'll support them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  And the lie just got revealed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=54.86s)]
*  If you listen to what John Kirby said, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=56.56s)]
*  they asked him, are the Ukrainians willing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=58.92s)]
*  to have a ceasefire? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=60.88s)]
*  And he said, not only won't they, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=61.78s)]
*  we won't allow it either. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=64.08s)]
*  Essentially admitting finally, what's long been obvious, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  that the country funding the war, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=68.68s)]
*  providing the arms for the war, which is the United States, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  determines if and when the war ends. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=72.88s)]
*  And we obviously don't want that war to end. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=74.92s)]
*  How are people who are pushing for the sacrifice [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  of more Ukrainian and Russian children, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=80.58s)]
*  for whatever it's worth, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=82.68s)]
*  how did they seize the moral high ground [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=83.86s)]
*  in this conversation? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=85.76s)]
*  They're monsters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=86.68s)]
*  Are they allowed to lecture the rest of us [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  about human rights? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  So there's a propagandistic narrative from the beginning [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=92.26s)]
*  that the Ukrainians are feisty, courageous, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  and are fighting for their own country, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=97.2s)]
*  and we ought to stand by their side. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=98.56s)]
*  The reality is the complete opposite. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=100.36s)]
*  The Ukrainians do not want this war to continue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=102.2s)]
*  Zelensky is not using a voluntary army. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  He's using a conscript army. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  He is drafting these people who are unwilling to fight [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  and has repeatedly in the last four months [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=113.26s)]
*  on three occasions increased the punishments [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=115.32s)]
*  for desertion or for people who are otherwise [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  rebelling against this war, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  because the Ukrainians know that they're being used [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  as cannon fodder for the interest of other people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=125.41999999999999s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  So it's a conscript army. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  They're forcing these Ukrainians to go and die [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  in huge numbers for things that are not in their interest. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=133.22s)]
*  What's in their interest is to negotiate with the Russians [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=136.76s)]
*  over an agreement that will allow Ukraine to keep the parts [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=139.68s)]
*  of their country that want to be ruled by Kiev, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=143.56s)]
*  and it's the United States and Great Britain [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=145.9s)]
*  that are blocking it purely for our own interests. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=148.02s)]
*  Yeah, and then they're lecturing you? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=151.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=154.4s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, I appreciate it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=155.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for that analysis. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=156.9s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=158.7s)]
*  That analysis. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOhZnCJK7k&t=159.52s)]
