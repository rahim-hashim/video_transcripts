# Victor Davis Hanson: Midterm re-election will be a 'realignment'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI)
*  So it seems pretty clear Democrats are going to lose big on Tuesday, and they know it, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=0.0s)]
*  and they're panicking as a result of that, and they've gone basically completely nuts. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=6.32s)]
*  Here's Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=11.52s)]
*  This is what happens in a country that follows what happened in Germany in the early 30s. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=15.48s)]
*  This country is on track to repeat what happened in Germany when it was the greatest democracy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=23.62s)]
*  going, elected a chancellor who then co-opted the media that this past president calling [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=31.5s)]
*  the press the enemy of the people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=42.58s)]
*  That is a bunch of crap, and we know it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=45.14s)]
*  And that's what's going on in this country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=48.66s)]
*  So Weimar Germany was the greatest government ever? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=51.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  Weimar Germany was great, and Republicans are Nazis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  It's hard even to know where to start, so we've asked Victor Davis Hansen from the Hoover [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=59.8s)]
*  Institution to join us tonight. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=62.58s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=64.18s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=66.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=67.98s)]
*  It's just nonsense, and the only way we can look at it, Tucker, is that we haven't had [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  in 90 years the left seize the control of government, and they have the Congress and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=74.62s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=79.34s)]
*  It's not that we have a border that's open. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=81.02s)]
*  They blew up the border. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=84.34s)]
*  It's not they're letting criminals out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=85.5s)]
*  They blew up the criminal justice system. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=87.02s)]
*  It's not that they shut down Anwar. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=88.94s)]
*  They blew up the whole idea of self-sufficiency and energy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=91.46s)]
*  And when you ask them about it, they won't defend it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=94.74s)]
*  They won't say, well, we got three million illegal aliens. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  No, they don't talk about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  And they won't change. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  They won't say, well, let's build 100 miles of the wall, or let's reopen Keystone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  So all they do instead is they have a mantra. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=108.94s)]
*  It's a trifecta. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  They said, if you're going not to vote for Democrats, if you don't vote for a Democrat, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  you destroy democracy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=116.94s)]
*  And every woman in the United States has a constitutional right to have an abortion to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=118.78s)]
*  the last minute before birth. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump and his supporters, half the country are fascists. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=124.58s)]
*  The only good thing out of this toxic two years that we've endured, we lab rats from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=128.46s)]
*  one of these mad scientists, is that in a weird way, they brought people together, Tucker. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=132.54s)]
*  There's a new ecumenical movement of African-American males, Hispanics, and the white working class [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=138.42s)]
*  that detest these bi-coastal elites. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=144.61999999999998s)]
*  And they're starting to look at class concerns rather than these racial differences. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  And just the antipathy toward these left-wing elites has created a consensus that I haven't [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=151.66s)]
*  seen in my lifetime. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=157.38s)]
*  But I think we're going to be shocked next Tuesday when it roars. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=158.38s)]
*  It's going to be a mouse, and it's going to roar, and they're not ready for it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's why they're panicking. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=165.42s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=167.38s)]
*  I think you're, I mean, I've been a coastal elite my whole life, and I could not have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=169.58s)]
*  more contempt for them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=172.46s)]
*  And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=173.46s)]
*  So you think, just to bottom line it for us, since you're a historian, you think this will [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=174.74s)]
*  be a realignment next Tuesday? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=183.7s)]
*  And I think we paid a hell of a price to put up for two years with this insanity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=184.7s)]
*  But there will be some good out of it, because people saw in the raw nihilism and socialism. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=189.1s)]
*  And what they saw was ugly, and they don't want any part of it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=194.56s)]
*  And it's going to bring people together that no one ever would imagine have common class [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=196.96s)]
*  interest. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=201.28s)]
*  And it's going to be a revolt against these, as I said, these bi-coastal snarky elites. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=202.28s)]
*  Nobody likes them, and then we're going to find out on Tuesday just how much they don't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  like them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=210.96s)]
*  Oh man, you're making me happy just saying that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=211.96s)]
*  The great Victor Davis Hanson, thank you so much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=215.36s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEZdjcNpHI&t=217.76s)]
