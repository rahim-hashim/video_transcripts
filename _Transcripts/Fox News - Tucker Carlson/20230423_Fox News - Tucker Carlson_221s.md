# PETA rep tells Tucker NYC rats ‘aren't the problem’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE)
*  Well, New York City has gotten a lot dirtier. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not your imagination. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=3.04s)]
*  The city's leadership is responsible for this, but they've decided to blame rodents for it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=4.76s)]
*  They've hired a rat czar and identified rat mitigation zones. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=9.6s)]
*  There's a local news report explaining it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=15.48s)]
*  They're quick, dirty, disease-prone, and above all, a nuisance. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=17.36s)]
*  Yet, rats continue to make their presence very well known on New York City streets, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=21.36s)]
*  in some neighborhoods even more than others. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  The city plans to zero in on eight areas so full of vermin, the Department of Health [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=29.2s)]
*  has designated them rat mitigation zones. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=33.6s)]
*  In Manhattan, extra rat-fighting patrols will be on hand in Harlem, Chinatown, the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=37.0s)]
*  East Village, and the Lower East Side. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  In the Bronx, Grand Concourse, and in Brooklyn, Prospect Heights, Bed-Stuy, and Bushwick. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=44.04s)]
*  That's where neighbors were able to attest rodents are running rampant. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=49.64s)]
*  The eight neighborhoods were deemed high priority thanks to a slew of 3-1-1 calls and complaints [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  about infestations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=58.96s)]
*  Now, those areas will get more attention from the city, like increased enforcement on properties [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=60.32s)]
*  that fail inspections and rat academy training. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=65.24s)]
*  Free workshops offered by the Department of Health on rat management. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=68.56s)]
*  So the question is, is New York City dirty because it has a lot of rats, or does it have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=73.8s)]
*  a lot of rats because it's dirty? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=77.92s)]
*  For a different perspective on this, we thought we would ask Ashley Byrne. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=81.6s)]
*  She works at PETA, where she's the director of outreach, and she joins us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=84.8s)]
*  Ashley, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=87.56s)]
*  I think this is a really interesting point. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=90.44s)]
*  I don't have a lot of rats in my house because I don't have a lot of rotting garbage in my [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=92.0s)]
*  house. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  And so maybe the problem isn't the rats, it's the people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=97.92s)]
*  I hadn't thought about it until you brought it up, but if you wouldn't mind explaining. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Tucker. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=105.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, the rats are not the problem. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  The disgusting human behavior that is attracting the rats, that's the problem. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=111.16s)]
*  We are basically inviting them to be here by putting out a daily buffet of garbage around [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=117.76s)]
*  the city. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=123.44s)]
*  And these intelligent creatures don't deserve to die painful, excruciating deaths because [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=125.04s)]
*  of human irresponsibility. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=132.48s)]
*  Or shouldn't we at least, I mean, even if you're not going to go as far as you're going, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=135.64s)]
*  and you're I think at the place where you're saying, let's not kill the rats, even if you're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=140.16s)]
*  kind of for maybe killing some rats, couldn't we also do our part as people and like not [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=142.68s)]
*  leave pizza slices on the sidewalk and pick up the garbage regularly? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=147.12s)]
*  Why shouldn't we play in a role too? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=151.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=154.16s)]
*  You know, as long as we don't clean up our act, the city can kill as many rats as it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=155.16s)]
*  wants to. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=159.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=160.0s)]
*  They're just going to keep coming back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=161.0s)]
*  You know, this is nothing more than a quick fix. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=162.0s)]
*  If killing rats worked, we wouldn't have a rat problem because people have already been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=165.28s)]
*  killing rats in this city for decades. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  But we live under mountains of garbage, so they have not gone away and they won't. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=171.36s)]
*  Who do you and you obviously study animal behavior. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=176.12s)]
*  Do you think long term the rats are smarter than the leadership of the city or the city's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=178.6s)]
*  leadership smarter than the rats? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=184.56s)]
*  Well I'll say this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=188.24s)]
*  Rats are actually very clean animals and they're smart enough not to treat their homes like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=190.52s)]
*  a garbage dump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  So I'll leave it at that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  Ashley Bernapita, you know, you guys have this reputation for being so extreme. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=201.12s)]
*  I didn't think that was extreme. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=204.52s)]
*  I thought that was a really good point and I'm glad that you came on tonight. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=205.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=208.44s)]
*  Thanks so much Tucker. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9WI4bgzriE&t=209.44s)]
