# Tucker Carlson: Hunter Biden was right about Dr. Jill
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU)
*  So, Hunter Biden's text messages and emails and videos are all out there on the internet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=0.0s)]
*  for the world to see, and that is a pretty major invasion of privacy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=7.44s)]
*  We will concede that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=9.76s)]
*  How would you like your text messages to get out there in public? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=10.76s)]
*  On the other hand, they probably wouldn't be quite as interesting as Hunter Biden's. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=12.56s)]
*  And on balance, we're glad to see them because we're learning a lot about the Biden family's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  business arrangements with China, and they are extensive. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=19.6s)]
*  But we're also learning about what the Biden family is like, and boy, are they repulsive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=22.32s)]
*  We learned, among other things, what Hunter Biden thinks of the family matriarch, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=27.2s)]
*  that would of course be America's doctor, Dr. Jill. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=31.28s)]
*  Now the Sun is reporting that in one text message, Hunter Biden once described his stepmother, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=34.68s)]
*  that would be the first lady of the United States, as we're quoting now a vindictive [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=38.6s)]
*  moron. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=42.28s)]
*  He also called her the bad word, which we can't use on TV, but it's the bad one, the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=43.28s)]
*  one you can't use even at home. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=47.28s)]
*  Use that word. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=49.28s)]
*  But what about vindictive moron? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=50.64s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, we did a little research and it turns out, yeah, it's true. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  She's a vindictive moron. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=55.84s)]
*  We know she's a moron because we read her doctoral thesis, and that proves, among other [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=56.84s)]
*  things, that she can't do simple math. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=60.32s)]
*  And if you don't believe that, here's one extra, and we're quoting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=61.84s)]
*  Three quarters of the class will be Caucasian, one quarter of the class will be African American, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=64.48s)]
*  one seat will hold a Latino, and the remaining seats will be filled with students of Asian [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=68.4s)]
*  descent or non-resident aliens. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  How many percentage points is that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Now later on in the thesis, a doctoral thesis, why she's Dr. Jill, she miscalculates private [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=77.44s)]
*  enrollment by more than, let's see, 200 percentage points. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=82.92s)]
*  Now you might be tempted to dismiss all of that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  Maybe she wrote her thesis in 10 minutes in the subway knowing that no one at the University [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=88.92s)]
*  of Delaware would dare correct it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And of course they didn't. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=94.12s)]
*  And that would explain the hundreds of typos in her thesis. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=95.28s)]
*  But you don't need to believe for thesis to know that Dr. Jill is, in fact, in the words [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=100.28s)]
*  of Hunter Biden himself, her son, a moron because we have videos of her speaking. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=103.68s)]
*  Here was Dr. Jill yesterday at something called the Latinx Inclusion Luncheon in San Antonio, Texas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=108.96s)]
*  Yes, I'm not patronizing you Latinx people, but you're all tacos. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=139.0s)]
*  It's all tacos. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=148.0s)]
*  That's what the First Lady said. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=149.0s)]
*  Now the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which presumably supports the Biden administration, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=150.36s)]
*  decided they had to explain some things very slowly to Dr. Jill. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Among others, they said this, quote, using breakfast tacos to try and demonstrate the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=158.32s)]
*  uniqueness of Latinos demonstrates a lack of cultural knowledge. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=161.96s)]
*  We are not tacos. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=165.74s)]
*  We are not tacos. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=169.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=171.52s)]
*  So Jill Biden realized, whoa, maybe we shouldn't call them tacos. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=172.52s)]
*  So her press secretary, a publicist, put out a statement doing a little damage control. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=175.68s)]
*  Quote, the First Lady apologizes that her words conveyed anything but pure admiration [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=179.06s)]
*  and love for the Latino community. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=184.78s)]
*  Wait a second, Jill Biden, Dr. Jill, the Latino community? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  What happened to the Latinx community? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=190.58s)]
*  Was that the whole point of the luncheon to tell Latinos that actually they're Latinx? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=192.86s)]
*  Seegender your language, sexist Latinos. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=196.46s)]
*  Well, the truth is for a long time, connecting with the Latinx community has drained every [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=201.46s)]
*  ounce of intellect that Jill Biden has to offer, which is limited, as we noted. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  Here was Jill Biden a year ago speaking to union workers in California. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=210.02s)]
*  This is one of the greatest moments ever caught on camera. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  So pause, turn the volume up on your set and enjoy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=215.78s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=219.18s)]
*  So say it with me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=222.5s)]
*  Cese padres. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=224.62s)]
*  Cese padres, podways or something. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=231.62s)]
*  As Cesar Chavez used to say, Cese padres. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=236.82s)]
*  He couldn't speak Spanish either. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=239.82s)]
*  Don't you worry. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=241.0s)]
*  So Dr. Jill's a moron. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=242.06s)]
*  Hunter Biden was absolutely right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=243.18s)]
*  But is she vindictive too? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  That's the outstanding question. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=247.06s)]
*  Hunter called her a vindictive moron. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=248.06s)]
*  Moron, yes, vindictive. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=249.22s)]
*  Jury still out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, we know a few days ago, Jill Biden wrote on Twitter that women, quote, have the right [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=251.62s)]
*  to make our own decisions about our bodies. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=257.58000000000004s)]
*  Of course, not with the VACs, but with abortion. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=259.26s)]
*  So reading this, retired Lieutenant General Gary Valesky, a former army spokesman who [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=262.06s)]
*  mentored soldiers responded this way, quote, glad to see you finally know what a woman [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=265.86s)]
*  is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=269.74s)]
*  Well, guess what happened to General Valesky? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=270.74s)]
*  He got suspended. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  Now he's being investigated by the US Army, which has no problem with China, but they're [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=275.94s)]
*  very concerned that someone might criticize Dr. Jill. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=279.34s)]
*  So Hunter Biden was right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=283.46s)]
*  And we're just going to say it out loud. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=284.46s)]
*  Hunter Biden was right about Dr. Jill. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=285.46s)]
*  Vindictive moron. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F7E-M4TFU&t=289.46s)]
