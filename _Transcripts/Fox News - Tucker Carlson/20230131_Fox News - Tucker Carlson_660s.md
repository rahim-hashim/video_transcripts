# Tucker Carlson: This is the cruelest thing any president has ever done
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Have you ever noticed that there's not a single person [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=2.6s)]
*  in the entire over-staffed Biden administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=5.2s)]
*  whose job it is to announce good news, not one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=8.32s)]
*  There's the now familiar Office of Attacking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=11.82s)]
*  the Middle Class, they're usually quite busy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=13.84s)]
*  There's the Department of New and Counterproductive Wars, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=16.12s)]
*  those people never sleep. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=18.6s)]
*  And of course, there's the all-powerful Directorate [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=20.16s)]
*  of Hysteria, which makes sure that every living American [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=22.32s)]
*  is terrified of something or other from breakfast till bed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=25.2s)]
*  But there is no Good News Office. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=28.12s)]
*  That's something that Biden people never considered. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=29.92s)]
*  So yesterday, the administration seemed a little awkward, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=32.04s)]
*  maybe even sheepish, when it announced the best news of all, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  which is that the COVID era has finally passed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=37.7s)]
*  For three years, the US has lived under a permanent [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=41.42s)]
*  government-designated COVID emergency. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=44.0s)]
*  At this point, looking backward, no one can agree [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=47.08s)]
*  on what the point of it was. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=48.92s)]
*  Certainly nobody got any healthier, that's for sure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  In any case, it's ending for good or bad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Technically, the emergency will continue until May. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=55.64s)]
*  This will allow the Biden administration to shovel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=58.48s)]
*  a few more cargo planes full of tax dollars [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=60.16s)]
*  to with donors in the so-called healthcare industry. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  But that's it, those are the last gasps [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=64.92s)]
*  of the Rona scare, we're done. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  And that means, above all, that we can finally get [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=69.24s)]
*  to the second and much more satisfying part of the program [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  where we finally hold the people accountable [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=74.96s)]
*  who did what they just did to us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=77.96s)]
*  And first on that list would be Joe Biden. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=79.84s)]
*  At this point, Biden has the functional IQ [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=81.92s)]
*  of office furniture, but his instinctive viciousness [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=83.72s)]
*  remains intact. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=86.66s)]
*  So Biden, the second he got into office, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=88.7s)]
*  wasted no time at all in blaming Americans [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=90.46s)]
*  for a virus that China created. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=93.34s)]
*  And then in using the pandemic to pit neighbors [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=95.42s)]
*  against one another. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=97.58s)]
*  It was the cruelest and most divisive thing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  any president has ever done to his own country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  Because you've forgotten what it looked like, here you go. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=103.66s)]
*  I'm announcing that the Department of Labor [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=106.78s)]
*  is developing an emergency rule to require all employers [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=109.62s)]
*  with 100 or more employees that together employ [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  over 80 million workers to ensure their workforces [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=118.34s)]
*  are fully vaccinated or show a negative test [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=123.9s)]
*  at least once a week. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=128.22s)]
*  We're going to protect vaccinated workers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=129.3s)]
*  from unvaccinated coworkers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=133.34s)]
*  The last thing we need is the neanderthal thinking [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=137.26s)]
*  that in the meantime, everything's fine, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=139.66s)]
*  take off your mask, forget it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  For unvaccinated, we are looking at a winner [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=145.38s)]
*  of severe illness and death for unvaccinated. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  For themselves, their families, and the hospitals, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=151.18s)]
*  they'll soon overwhelm. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin, Americans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=156.22s)]
*  If you want to take an untested experimental mRNA shot [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  from a company that has bought immunity from Congress [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=162.3s)]
*  against future lawsuits, you are a selfish neanderthal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=164.66s)]
*  Worse, you're a killer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  You're literally, literally killing your own neighbors. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=169.02s)]
*  The only good news is you will soon die yourself [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=172.46s)]
*  because you deserve it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=174.58s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden said. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  The president said that to his own people, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=177.94s)]
*  and it was, of course, a lie. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=179.74s)]
*  Leaving aside its potentially terrifying side effects, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=181.38s)]
*  the shot did not work as advertised. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=183.78s)]
*  Sorry, it just didn't. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  It did not prevent people from dying, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=186.46s)]
*  did not even prevent them from transmitting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  or getting COVID themselves, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  and that's why vaccinated people still wear masks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=191.3s)]
*  Everyone knows this, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  but Joe Biden has never admitted any of it, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  nor has the federal government rehired [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  the thousands of good people, really the best people, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=200.54s)]
*  the Navy SEALs, the nurses, the EMTs, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  the firemen, the airline pilots, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=205.66s)]
*  the people who were fired from their jobs [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=207.14s)]
*  for making what turned out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=209.06s)]
*  to be a pretty solid medical decision. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=210.06s)]
*  By the way, no one's ever explained [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=212.82s)]
*  why it was immoral somehow to treat COVID [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=213.82s)]
*  before patients wound up on respirators. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=218.38s)]
*  What was so bad about ivermectin [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=219.22s)]
*  and monoclonal antibody therapy? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=220.7s)]
*  We still don't know. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=222.26s)]
*  The administration still won't tell us [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=223.98s)]
*  where the virus came from, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=225.14s)]
*  though obviously they know the answer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=226.38s)]
*  But now is the time to find out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=228.66s)]
*  We need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=230.14s)]
*  to get the bottom of what we just lived through, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=232.06s)]
*  and let's hope we get one very soon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=233.82s)]
*  But in the meantime, this being Washington, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=236.1s)]
*  the end of COVID, the end of the emergency, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=238.06s)]
*  poses a much more immediate political problem [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=241.26s)]
*  for the people in charge. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=243.62s)]
*  The Democratic Party can't govern the country [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=245.18s)]
*  without emergencies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  If the public is ever allowed to calm down long enough [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=249.06s)]
*  to think clearly, uncomfortable questions might emerge. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=251.62s)]
*  Wait a second! [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  If my kid can't get into a good college [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=256.82s)]
*  or work at a big company because he's white, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=258.62s)]
*  how is this systemic racism thing real? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=260.62s)]
*  And if it is real, why can't I just change my race [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  like all those people on TV are always changing their sex [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=266.58s)]
*  just by wishing it's so? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=268.9s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=270.14s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  If people start asking questions like that, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=272.94s)]
*  that would be bad. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=274.78s)]
*  It would be a disaster. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=276.14s)]
*  So clearly the Democratic Party needs a new emergency, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=278.18s)]
*  at least until we start sending ground troops to Ukraine [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=280.74s)]
*  and the population becomes suitably hysterical again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=282.78s)]
*  So because they need an emergency, they found one. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=285.74s)]
*  And the new emergency turns out to be the old emergency, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=288.1s)]
*  which is white racism. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=290.38s)]
*  Now, unfortunately for the Democratic Party, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=292.06s)]
*  white racism is one commodity, like cedar boards, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=293.5s)]
*  that's getting harder to find. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  Very few unarmed black men [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=299.5s)]
*  are killed by white cops these days. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=300.98s)]
*  Where's George Floyd when you need him? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  So instead, in a pinch, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=304.38s)]
*  they've settled for an unarmed black man [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  killed by black cops, which they have informed us, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  nevertheless, despite all appearances, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  is still the product of white racism. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  And Barack Obama enthusiastically agrees. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  This is Barack Obama's lane. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=316.14s)]
*  He was elected president twice on this kind of stuff. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=318.38s)]
*  So he immediately jumped into the middle [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=320.74s)]
*  of the Memphis tragedy to remind us [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=322.58s)]
*  that white middle-class Republicans did this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=324.7s)]
*  Blood is on their hands. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  Selma, Dr. King, Rodney King, Trayvon Martin. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=328.14s)]
*  They're all the fruit of white supremacy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=330.5s)]
*  It's true. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=332.78s)]
*  And as Obama explained on Twitter, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=333.62s)]
*  you can learn a lot more about how it's true on his website. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=335.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=338.02s)]
*  So we decided to go there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=339.14s)]
*  We went to the Obama Foundation website today, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  and there we found an entire section [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=342.97999999999996s)]
*  on how we have to continue to defund the police. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=344.74s)]
*  Yes, people are still saying it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=347.5s)]
*  Quote, cities like Los Angeles, Baltimore, and Philadelphia [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=348.94s)]
*  have reduced their budgets for their police departments, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=352.54s)]
*  the Obama Foundation explained without laughing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=354.7s)]
*  These cuts made funding more available [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  for other elements of public safety, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=359.06s)]
*  like affordable housing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=361.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=364.1s)]
*  Because affordable housing is public safety, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=364.94s)]
*  unless that affordable housing is in Chicago or Baltimore, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=368.5s)]
*  in which case you're likely to be killed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=370.62s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  The point is, take three steps back, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=373.46s)]
*  Barack Obama, the former president, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=375.14s)]
*  is weighing in directly on America's latest fake hate crime. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  And you have to wonder why. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=382.06s)]
*  He's not doing it for himself. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  Obama is retired at this point. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=384.9s)]
*  He's living on Martha's Vineyard [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=386.26s)]
*  with all the other rich white people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=387.34s)]
*  He's doing it for his wife, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=389.74s)]
*  his wife who's never had a real job, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=391.62s)]
*  and apparently is feeling kind of restless approaching 60. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=393.02s)]
*  And that's why you may have noticed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=396.62s)]
*  that six years after leaving Washington, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=397.74s)]
*  Michelle Obama is back in the news. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=399.34s)]
*  She's got a new book and a media tour [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=401.66s)]
*  and even a federally funded hiking trail [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=403.86s)]
*  named for herself in Atlanta. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=406.02000000000004s)]
*  Why has she emerged in this way? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=408.06s)]
*  Well, there might be a reason. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=411.22s)]
*  In fact, if you didn't know any better, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=412.98s)]
*  if you were visiting this country from a foreign land, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=414.18s)]
*  trying to figure out what's going on in the US, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=416.22s)]
*  you might mistake what Michelle Obama is doing right now [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=418.42s)]
*  for the beginnings of a presidential campaign. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=421.22s)]
*  So first you have a manufactured white racism panic. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  That's a clue. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=427.58000000000004s)]
*  But the clincher is menopause. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=429.1s)]
*  Unlike every other woman over 50 in all human history, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=432.18s)]
*  Michelle Obama, we're sad to tell you, has menopause. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=435.18s)]
*  It's not clear where she caught it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=437.98s)]
*  Maybe there was an outbreak in Egertown, but it's bad. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=438.98s)]
*  At one point, Michelle Obama gained up to six pounds. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=442.3s)]
*  You don't know how much she suffered. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=445.22s)]
*  Let's put it this way, baton death march survivors, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=446.98s)]
*  she laughs at you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  You can't fathom her pain. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=451.74s)]
*  Watch her talk about it on TV. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=453.14000000000004s)]
*  I am still physically active, and my goal now, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=455.38s)]
*  instead of having Michelle Obama arms, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=459.38s)]
*  I just want to keep moving. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=461.9s)]
*  Just keep moving. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=463.46s)]
*  If I can walk, move, I don't have to run, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=465.26s)]
*  I don't have to beat everyone. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=468.62s)]
*  So I've had to change the way I see myself in my health space. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  I never used to weigh myself. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=475.46s)]
*  I'm not trying to stick to numbers, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=477.5s)]
*  but when you're in menopause, you have this slow creep. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=479.3s)]
*  You have this slow creep. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=484.5s)]
*  And no, she's not talking about Joe Biden here, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=486.86s)]
*  who is technically one of the slowest creeps in America. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=489.1s)]
*  She's talking about her own thighs. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=492.1s)]
*  Now why is Michelle Obama telling you [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=494.3s)]
*  about her menopausal thighs on a TV show? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=496.06s)]
*  Possibly because she's a crazed narcissist [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=499.1s)]
*  who thinks her own thighs are interesting to you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=501.26s)]
*  And that's, of course, true. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=504.3s)]
*  But there may be other reasons. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=506.34s)]
*  Consider that today's Washington Post [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=508.5s)]
*  expressed deep dissatisfaction [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=511.3s)]
*  with Joe Biden's current heir, Kamala Harris. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=513.66s)]
*  Now Harris is a woman who cannot even consistently pronounce [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=517.26s)]
*  her own first name. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=519.7s)]
*  And she might not be, as the Post suggests, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=521.5s)]
*  up for the job of leading this country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=523.86s)]
*  And we're quoting, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=525.74s)]
*  Some Democrats are worried about Harris's political prospects, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=526.66s)]
*  the paper says. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=529.46s)]
*  They're worried she may not have the, quote, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=530.54s)]
*  political skills to win a national race. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=532.3s)]
*  Whoa, wait a second, pale colonizer. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=535.34s)]
*  Kamala Harris doesn't have skills? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=539.26s)]
*  Isn't that racist? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=541.3s)]
*  Well, as the Post reports, yes it is. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=543.34s)]
*  Quote, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=545.86s)]
*  So here's the problem for the Democratic Party. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=559.3s)]
*  The current vice president is totally incompetent [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=561.14s)]
*  and universally loathed by everyone, including her staff [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=563.5s)]
*  and possibly her husband, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=565.98s)]
*  who literally kissed her with a mask on. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=567.06s)]
*  We're not judging, but you can see it for yourself. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  So you don't want her, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=571.62s)]
*  but you can't just ditch her for a white dude. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=572.98s)]
*  Sorry, that's not equity. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=575.26s)]
*  So where do you go from here? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=578.06s)]
*  Ooh, good question. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=579.38s)]
*  And it turns out it's a question that Michelle Obama [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=580.62s)]
*  seems to have been thinking about recently. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=583.78s)]
*  Here she is this fall, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=586.06s)]
*  considering the matter of whether her elderly old servant, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  sorry, her dear, dear friend, Joe Biden, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=590.18s)]
*  should grace this country with yet another term [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=592.6999999999999s)]
*  as president. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=594.74s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=595.5799999999999s)]
*  But it's a tough job, and I think that he's doing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=596.78s)]
*  the best he can under some tough circumstances. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=599.02s)]
*  Do you hope that President Biden will run again in 2024? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=601.98s)]
*  You know, I will have to see. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=605.86s)]
*  You know, the reason I don't speak on that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=612.86s)]
*  is because I know what it feels like [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=616.18s)]
*  to be on the other side of it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=617.86s)]
*  And I think that that's a personal decision. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=620.1s)]
*  I don't want to be one of the millions of people [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=623.3399999999999s)]
*  weighing in on what he should do. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=625.3s)]
*  He's doing a pause here the best he can. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=629.66s)]
*  As to whether he runs again, Michelle Obama's gonna have to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=633.14s)]
*  much longer pause here accompanied by a wearied sigh. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=635.8199999999999s)]
*  She's gonna have to quote, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=638.42s)]
*  have to see about Joe Biden, have to see. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=639.9s)]
*  The question is, will the rest of us have to see [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=643.06s)]
*  a whole lot more of Michelle Obama in the next two years? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knFTRMBA5zQ&t=645.3399999999999s)]
