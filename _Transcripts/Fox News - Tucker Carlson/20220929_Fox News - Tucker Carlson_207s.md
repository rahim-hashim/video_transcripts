# Tucker Carlson: Ghoulish Dems, Don Lemon rush to politicize Hurricane Ian
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurricane Ian, as we have told you, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=1.56s)]
*  has crushed the state of Florida. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=3.36s)]
*  More than a million people have no power. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=5.24s)]
*  This is a catastrophe. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=7.84s)]
*  It's a national disaster. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=9.16s)]
*  People will certainly be killed because of it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=11.6s)]
*  Under circumstances like that, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=14.48s)]
*  decent people put politics aside for a moment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=16.16s)]
*  because they're not ghouls. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=19.36s)]
*  They realize some things like life and death [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=20.56s)]
*  are more important than politics. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  They don't give political sermons at funerals, for example. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=25.16s)]
*  But on MSNBC, there's no reason [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=28.56s)]
*  to abide by the basic standards of decency. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=32.72s)]
*  So today, that channel invited former Missouri Senator [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=34.68s)]
*  Claire McCaskill to deliver a sermon [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=37.84s)]
*  to everyone stuck without power in Florida facing death. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=40.12s)]
*  And that message was, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=42.84s)]
*  stop complaining about Joe Biden, serfs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  When it's all over, I hope some of those Floridians [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  who hate the federal government [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=49.64s)]
*  remember that the federal government is there for them [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=51.04s)]
*  at a time of disaster. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=53.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=56.08s)]
*  Can you imagine lecturing people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=57.96s)]
*  who are cowering in their houses trying not to get killed? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=60.24s)]
*  No decency, no shame. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=64.8s)]
*  None of them have any shame or any decency. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=66.84s)]
*  Over at CNN, Don Lamont repeatedly tried to link [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  the hurricane to climate change. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  It's the first hurricane ever. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=74.76s)]
*  And that's when his guest, Jamie Rhoam, shut him down [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=76.44s)]
*  because unlike Don Lamont, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Jamie Rhoam knows what he's talking about. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=80.12s)]
*  He's the director of the National Oceanic [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=81.6s)]
*  and Atmospheric Administration Hurricane Center. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=83.2s)]
*  Watch this exchange. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us what this is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  and what effect climate change has on this phenomenon? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=90.16s)]
*  We can come back and talk about climate change [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  at a later time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  I want to focus on the here and now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=98.52s)]
*  Listen, I'm just trying to get that you said [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  you want to talk about climate change, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  but what effect does climate change have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=103.32s)]
*  on this phenomenon that is happening now? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=104.96s)]
*  Because it seems these storms are intensifying. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=107.8s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=110.24s)]
*  I don't think you can link climate change [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=111.08s)]
*  to any one event on the... [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=112.44s)]
*  Okay, well, listen, I grew up there [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=114.84s)]
*  and I'm not saying that it's not intensifying. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=117.92s)]
*  Something is causing them to intensify. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=119.68s)]
*  How can I help the Democratic Party [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=123.36s)]
*  in the middle of a humanitarian disaster? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Most people don't think that way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=127.76s)]
*  But Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota certainly does. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=129.68s)]
*  She announced on television [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=133.16s)]
*  that only if we had given her a lot more power, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=134.4s)]
*  hurricanes wouldn't happen [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=137.28s)]
*  because it turns out that Amy Klobuchar and her friends [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=138.56s)]
*  control the weather if only you vote for them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=141.16s)]
*  We just did something about climate change [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=143.2s)]
*  for the first time in decades. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=145.44s)]
*  Hurricane bears down on Florida. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=147.4s)]
*  We got a win in the midterms. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=149.44s)]
*  So that's someone you would not hire [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=152.28s)]
*  as your executive assistant because she's too incompetent. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=154.44s)]
*  No one wants to work for her [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=157.68s)]
*  because she screams at her staff. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  And yet that person is claiming supernatural powers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=160.16s)]
*  If you just give me more power, I can control the weather. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=162.92s)]
*  And she's saying this as people are literally dying. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=165.6s)]
*  So we thought, well, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=168.32s)]
*  it might be worth finding out how this works. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=170.04s)]
*  So we called Amy Klobuchar's office today [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=171.56s)]
*  and asked her to come on to explain specifically [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=173.64s)]
*  how she would have taken control of the weather [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=176.28s)]
*  and prevented Hurricane Ian. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=179.8s)]
*  How would you have done it? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=181.52s)]
*  Here's full power, full funding Amy Klobuchar. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=182.44s)]
*  Tell us how you would have stopped the hurricane. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=185.16s)]
*  Weirdly, she didn't respond, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=188.12s)]
*  but she's always welcome on this show [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=189.12s)]
*  to tell us how she's in charge of the weather. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=191.0s)]
*  What do you think, you're God or something? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=193.84s)]
*  This is these people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=194.96s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=196.48s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=198.8s)]
*  stories that are changing the world [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=200.84s)]

*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQ3eVCgIvA&t=204.56s)]
