# Tucker Carlson: We didn't believe this was real, but it is
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw)
*  Martha's Vineyard is an idyllic spot in the Atlantic Osh off Massachusetts, but for decades [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=0.0s)]
*  now people in Martha's Vineyard have been pining for diversity. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=5.12s)]
*  We need more diversity. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=7.44s)]
*  We need more diversity. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=8.44s)]
*  Well, diversity finally arrived sent on a jet plane by Ron DeSantis and the second diversity [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=9.44s)]
*  arrived the locals, the ones who pined for diversity, called the army and had diversity [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=14.44s)]
*  shipped to a military base where apparently diversity belongs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=19.44s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=23.48s)]
*  People were not too upset at Martha's Vineyard as diversity was led away to a military base. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=24.8s)]
*  Cheers in Martha's Vineyard this morning just before migrants boarded buses to go on to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=29.92s)]
*  join base Cape Cod. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  The brown people are leaving. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  We're so excited. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=48.72s)]
*  Go brown people, go. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=49.72s)]
*  Don't come home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=50.72s)]
*  If you're not my housekeeper, get off the island. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=51.72s)]
*  So it may seem like they're bigots. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=54.96s)]
*  I mean, what's the other conclusion? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=57.24s)]
*  No, according to CNN, they're just grateful. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=59.56s)]
*  They were clapping in gratitude for Ron DeSantis and what he did, the gift that he gave them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=62.92s)]
*  Here's an actual CNN headline. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=67.8s)]
*  We didn't believe this was real, but it is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=69.12s)]
*  And we're quoting, they enriched us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=70.52s)]
*  Migrants 44 hour visit leaves indelible mark on Martha's Vineyard. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=73.8s)]
*  44 hours? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=78.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=80.2s)]
*  That didn't take long to leave an indelible mark. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=81.2s)]
*  Less than two days in the same zip code with Venezuelans and their lives are changed forever. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=83.64s)]
*  Does this remind you of the kid in your class who adopted a Spanish accent after spring [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=90.0s)]
*  break in Cabo? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=92.56s)]
*  Or the guy who converted to Islam because he once switched planes in Dubai? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=93.56s)]
*  It seems a little premature, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=97.2s)]
*  So we decided to look into it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=98.84s)]
*  Is Martha's Vineyard really congratulating itself for surviving its ever so brief encounter [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=101.4s)]
*  with Hispanics? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=107.4s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=108.76s)]
*  One nonprofit on the island called the Martha's Vineyard Community Foundation posted this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=111.0s)]
*  message on its website. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=114.66s)]
*  Again, this is real. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=115.66s)]
*  Our immigrant visitors have left the island. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  They have expressed enormous gratitude for the outpouring of support and generosity showed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  by the island community, which was heartfelt and overflowing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=123.56s)]
*  These people called the army in to have the Hispanics shipped to a military base. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=126.48s)]
*  But the Hispanics are very grateful to be shipped to a military base by the army. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=134.56s)]
*  They're grateful for the attention. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=139.76s)]
*  The foundation also praised island residents for raising $40,000 in a fundraiser for the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=142.28s)]
*  migrants. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=147.88s)]
*  Oh, but not really for the migrants because none of the money is going to actual migrants. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=148.88s)]
*  Of course it's not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=152.72s)]
*  Quote, the vineyard community stepped up in an unprecedented way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=153.72s)]
*  Really on whose behalf? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=158.2s)]
*  Oh, its own. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=159.2s)]
*  The money went to them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=160.48s)]
*  They raised money for themselves, not for the Venezuelans. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=161.48s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=164.88s)]
*  But if you want to know in any community across the United States where the locusts of self-congratulatory [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=166.76s)]
*  posturing is, where the most insufferable people in any given town, that of course would [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=175.56s)]
*  be the local Episcopal Church. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  And in Egertstown on Martha's Vineyard, that is St. Andrew's Episcopal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=181.44s)]
*  And needless to say, as their inclination, they self-congratulated big time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=185.12s)]
*  Quote, we have been so overwhelmed with everyone's kind words and thought and financial support [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=189.92s)]
*  for our brothers and sisters from Venezuela. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  Our brothers and sisters who we had deported instantly by men with guns. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  So we thought we'd check in with our brothers and sisters from Venezuela. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=205.76s)]
*  But unfortunately, they're locked up on a military base so they could not be reached [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=209.08s)]
*  for comment tonight. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNrxddaWTw&t=212.64000000000001s)]
