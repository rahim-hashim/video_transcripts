# Tucker Carlson: Did Biden family negotiate with Saudi government?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys)
*  So rest easy, ladies and gentlemen, a special council is supposedly looking into Joe Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=0.0s)]
*  They haven't produced anything that we know of, so the Daily Mail has to fill the gap. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=5.04s)]
*  They just found proof that Biden's brother, Jimmy, fast Jimmy Biden, was hired by a construction [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  company to negotiate with the Saudi government while Joe Biden was vice president because [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=13.48s)]
*  he's an expert on Middle East construction. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  We're also learning that the University of Delaware, like the University of Pennsylvania, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=21.36s)]
*  made a ton of money from, can you guess? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=25.0s)]
*  Oh yes, China, after Joe Biden opened a fake institute there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=27.08s)]
*  The dumbest man in politics has an academic institute. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=31.48s)]
*  A source tells Fox News that the FBI recently searched the University of Delaware twice [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  for classified documents belonging to Biden. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  The FBI is still assessing whether there were any classified documents there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Peter Schweitzer is probably the most talented digger into information like this in the United [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=45.84s)]
*  States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=53.36s)]
*  He's a member of the government accountability institute and we're really happy to have him [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=54.36s)]
*  join us tonight. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=56.56s)]
*  Peter, thank you for coming on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=57.56s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=58.56s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=59.56s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=62.0s)]
*  I mean, look, Tucker, if you look at the nexus of these financial ties that the Bidens have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=63.0s)]
*  with China, you have to go back to the Chinese state and you also have to go back to Chinese [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=67.96s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=73.32s)]
*  Let's keep in mind, Hunter Biden got three big deals in China. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=74.88s)]
*  Some of that money he shared with James Biden, you know, potentially it went to other family [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=78.24s)]
*  members. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=82.6s)]
*  So all three of the businessmen that made those deals happen, those ties are there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  The first one was a guy named Chae Feng. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=88.16s)]
*  He helped set up Hunter Biden on that BHR private equity deal that netted Hunter perhaps [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=90.64s)]
*  $20 million based on estimates. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  When he set Hunter Biden up with that deal, Chae Feng was partners with a gentleman named [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=100.52s)]
*  Ma Jian, who is the vice minister for state security in China, with responsible for foreign [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  recruitment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=111.52s)]
*  He's from Hong Kong Corporate Records. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=112.52s)]
*  The second deal that was set up for Hunter Biden was a guy named Henry Zhao. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=114.6s)]
*  Henry Zhao transferred $5 million into 100 Biden's accounts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=119.64s)]
*  At the time he did that, Henry Zhao was business partners with the daughter of the former minister [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  of state security who ran the entire spy apparatus of China. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=130.04s)]
*  If you look at Chairman Yi, the CEFC, the energy company, his previous job was working [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=134.6s)]
*  for Chinese military intelligence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=139.94s)]
*  So when you're talking about money coming from China to the Biden's, when you're talking [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=143.44s)]
*  about concerns about classified records, when you're concerned about what did the Biden's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  actually do in return for that money, these are all very serious, legitimate questions [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  that I don't have much confidence at all that the Department of Justice is going to look [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=157.28s)]
*  into. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=161.12s)]
*  It just seems so obvious. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=163.12s)]
*  I mean, these dots really do connect. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=165.12s)]
*  I have confidence in no one more than you in getting to the bottom of complex money-related [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=168.52s)]
*  stories. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=173.96s)]
*  But is there any doubt that what looks like was going on was actually going on? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=174.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=179.6s)]
*  I mean, Tucker, you know, you and I both went through the Cold War, at least the 1980s. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=180.6s)]
*  Imagine if Ronald Reagan's family or Jimmy Carter's family took, you know, tens of millions [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=187.2s)]
*  of dollars from Russian businessmen linked to the KGB. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=193.24s)]
*  Would there be any question at all that this requires serious investigation? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  Instead, what we're getting from a lot of people is, well, you can't prove that a crime [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  was being committed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=206.84s)]
*  It's an absurd standard that needs to be looked at. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=207.84s)]
*  Peter Schweitzer, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=210.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=213.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXMsuEMlys&t=214.0s)]
