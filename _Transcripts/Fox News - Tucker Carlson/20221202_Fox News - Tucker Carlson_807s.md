**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has provided Matt [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=3.36s)]
*  Taibbi of Substack with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=4.8s)]
*  thousands, apparently [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=6.04s)]
*  thousands and thousands of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=6.96s)]
*  internal documents at Twitter. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=8.68s)]
*  And they're coming out as we [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=10.24s)]
*  speak. We've told you this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  several times. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=11.88s)]
*  Those documents prove, among [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=12.88s)]
*  other things, the Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=13.96s)]
*  campaign and the DNC directed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=14.84s)]
*  Twitter to censor users and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=16.96s)]
*  Twitter complied and did this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=18.72s)]
*  in the critical final days of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=21.44s)]
*  the 2020 election cycle in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=23.6s)]

*  their emails to get Joe Biden [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  elected. They did the bidding [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=29.4s)]
*  of a political party and of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=31.16s)]
*  elected officials in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=32.36s)]
*  Washington, which is illegal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  to get Biden elected. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=35.32s)]
*  They rigged the information [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  available about that election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=38.4s)]
*  Now, that would include the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=40.64s)]
*  former Twitter general counsel, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=41.56s)]

*  at the FBI during the Russia [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=45.0s)]

*  overseeing the censorship [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=47.56s)]

*  Elon Musk wrote on Twitter, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=50.12s)]
*  quote, if this isn't a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  violation of the Constitution's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=52.08s)]
*  First Amendment, what is? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  There's so much here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=56.92s)]
*  Other documents just posted [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=57.68s)]
*  by TV minutes ago reveal that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=58.84s)]

*  Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=65.56s)]
*  And they knew it under Twitter's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  own stated rules. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=69.16s)]

*  This is just one part of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Twitter files that apparently [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  going to come out over a period [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=80.64s)]
*  of days. We will see. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=81.72s)]
*  But one of the things we've [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  learned already. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=84.64s)]
*  Is that Twitter, under [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=86.64s)]
*  pressure from Democrats. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=88.52s)]
*  Deleted a tweet from the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  legendary actor James Woods, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  who had straight outside the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=94.92s)]
*  lines by criticizing Hunter [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=96.36s)]
*  Biden, the DNC told this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=98.6s)]
*  before the last election, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  told Twitter to take it down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=101.28s)]
*  And so they did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=102.52s)]
*  James Woods joins us now by [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=103.96s)]

*  tweet was pulled down. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  You, of course, remember it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=115.28s)]
*  Did you suspect at the time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=116.52s)]

*  direct request of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=119.4s)]
*  Democratic National Committee? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=120.64s)]
*  I'm not surprised at all. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=122.56s)]
*  I'm shocked the way any [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=124.08s)]
*  other American would be if he [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=126.48s)]

*  major political party. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=132.16s)]
*  But here's why I'm not [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=133.64s)]
*  shocked. You may be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=134.44s)]
*  surprised to know that there [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=136.84s)]
*  was a lawsuit a while back. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=138.68s)]
*  A woman accused me of saying [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=141.04s)]
*  that she gave a Nazi salute [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=144.04s)]
*  and there was a whole bunch of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=145.8s)]
*  stuff about it on Twitter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=147.52s)]
*  And I didn't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=148.72s)]

*  without going into the details [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=152.84s)]
*  of that lawsuit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=154.24s)]
*  It turned out that the DNC was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  behind that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=156.96s)]
*  I won the lawsuit in federal [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=158.36s)]

*  appreciated actor. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=333.48s)]
*  And I missed my career. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=335.04s)]
*  And these people took it from me [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=336.88s)]
*  and I'll pay a price later [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=338.56s)]
*  in my life. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=340.48s)]

*  I am not going to take it [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=343.72s)]
*  sitting down. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=344.8s)]
*  I think these people are vermin [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=346.0s)]
*  for doing this to other people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=348.0s)]
*  Let's not talk about me [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=350.56s)]

*  just simple individuals who [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=353.0s)]
*  put out a tweet now their lives [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=355.84s)]

*  literally in my business [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=359.72s)]
*  literally go online [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=361.44s)]
*  and they check every actor [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=363.24s)]
*  who comes in for a part to see [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=365.8s)]
*  who they're following. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=367.36s)]
*  If an actor or an actress [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=368.56s)]
*  is following me, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=370.44s)]
*  they will blacklist them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=372.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=374.32s)]
*  It's about time this is torn open [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=375.08s)]
*  and I will tell you this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=376.92s)]
*  It's not just me, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=378.2s)]
*  but if you take the thousands [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=379.84s)]
*  of people that I'm sure they did [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=381.48s)]
*  and you got a class action suit, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  they might not be so happy about that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=387.0s)]
*  They really are in trouble right now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=389.56s)]
*  I think this will be something [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=391.52s)]
*  that they're not going to be happy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=393.4s)]
*  about in the long run. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  And you know, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  what am I going to get out of? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=399.0s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=400.2s)]
*  but I'm going to sue for this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  Look, there was a guy who called me [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  a cocaine addict on Twitter once, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=404.2s)]
*  never done drugs in my life. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  And they even stipulated, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  well, he was just doing it [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=410.32s)]
*  with hyperbole. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=411.4s)]
*  I won that suit. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=413.56s)]
*  I won the slap judgment on that suit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  So you can't talk about it [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=416.16s)]
*  because of the settlement [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=417.6s)]
*  that we did much more than that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=419.0s)]
*  And someone said, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=421.0s)]
*  why would you do it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  I said, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=423.08s)]
*  because it would defend my name. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=423.92s)]
*  I'm not going to let them slander me [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  like that was liable in that case. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  But there's a distinction, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=430.04s)]
*  as you know, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=431.44s)]
*  but I'm not going to put up with it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=432.44s)]
*  And if I have to be the flag bearer [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=434.32s)]
*  for this, then so be it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=435.88s)]
*  I'll be proud to do it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=437.12s)]
*  You should be proud. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=440.32s)]
*  I want to say in closing, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=442.16s)]
*  you may notice that I never [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  talk to the press anymore. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm asked every day. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=446.76000000000005s)]
*  I've left Twitter as my only source [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=448.88000000000005s)]
*  of public, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=451.52000000000004s)]

*  those are my words. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=457.8s)]
*  You're not going to alter it [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=458.88s)]
*  by doing a slow motion video of me [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  in black and white [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  and all that crap that they do. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=464.24s)]
*  But they've been doing this [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=466.16s)]
*  as a jihad against conservative people. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=468.20000000000005s)]
*  I was blocked on Twitter for eight months. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=470.88s)]
*  You know what I was suspended for? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  Quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=477.32s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=481.56s)]
*  That's how crazy these people are. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=482.56s)]
*  And one of the things that I said [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=484.68s)]
*  on Twitter once that has become [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=486.32s)]
*  kind of a meme, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  scratch the liberal [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=488.84s)]
*  and you'll find a fascist every time. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=489.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=492.24s)]
*  Let me tell you, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=492.64s)]
*  these Democrats, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=493.32s)]
*  and now I can say it [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=494.4s)]
*  because they are now my enemy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=495.36s)]
*  They declared this, not me. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=497.84s)]
*  But when they go around calling everybody, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=500.32s)]
*  oh, this one's a fascist and so on, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  none of the fascists are. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  Scratch a liberal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=506.4s)]
*  and you will find a fascist every time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=507.32s)]
*  Every time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I realize you don't want [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=514.56s)]
*  to do television interviews, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=516.76s)]
*  but you are always welcome on this show [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=517.64s)]
*  because that's one of the most amazing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=519.76s)]
*  conversations I've had in a while. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=521.56s)]
*  I mean, I'm really grateful [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  that we reached you tonight. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=524.72s)]
*  Sorry, I'm kind of a part [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=526.04s)]
*  in the metaphor shooting from the hip [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=527.68s)]
*  because I just I walked in the door [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=529.24s)]
*  and my wife said, my God, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=532.28s)]
*  I've you checked your phone? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=534.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=536.04s)]
*  It's up at the Ranger up in the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=536.44s)]
*  in the rain up in Lopez Canyon. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=538.64s)]
*  There's not even reception there. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=540.96s)]
*  I I looked at my phone. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=542.2s)]
*  I literally had hundreds of messages. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=543.96s)]
*  Well, what that what's going on? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=546.0s)]
*  And so I can't speak about this [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=548.04s)]
*  as with the informed consent [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=550.96s)]
*  that I would like to. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=553.72s)]
*  And I can't speak as intelligently [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=555.0s)]
*  as I would like to. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=556.84s)]
*  But, you know, when you see your name [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=558.08s)]
*  on an enemy's list. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=559.64s)]
*  You want to say to your enemies, you know? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  Really an interesting thing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=564.96s)]
*  When you declare somebody's your enemy, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  they can now say you're my enemy, too. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=568.32s)]
*  And it's a funny thing [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=570.72s)]
*  about the Constitution. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, I tweeted something today [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=573.32s)]
*  about James Monroe. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=574.76s)]
*  You know, James Monroe, President [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=576.0s)]
*  of the United States, by the way, later on. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=577.84s)]
*  You know how old he was when [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=579.4000000000001s)]
*  when when they signed [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=582.2800000000001s)]
*  the Declaration of Independence? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=583.36s)]
*  No, he was 18 years old. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  18 years old. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=588.64s)]
*  OK, John Adams was 19 years old. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, about all these old white men [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=593.44s)]
*  wrote the Constitution. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  They were teenagers [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=597.76s)]
*  fighting for an independent way of life, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=599.6s)]
*  fighting for rights, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  the most precious of which [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=603.84s)]
*  the most precious of which [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  was the right to free speech. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=608.2s)]
*  And the government of the United States [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=611.32s)]
*  inspired to take my free speech [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  and throw it in the gutter. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=617.24s)]
*  And there's something [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=621.12s)]
*  that they should fear more than anything [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=622.04s)]
*  they have ever imagined [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=624.44s)]
*  in their wildest dreams. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=625.8s)]
*  The most dangerous man [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=627.76s)]
*  to these corrupt, vile vermin. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=629.28s)]
*  There's an American [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  who's not afraid of them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=635.36s)]
*  And Joe Biden [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=637.2s)]
*  and all those rats [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=639.08s)]
*  who work with you at the DNC. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=640.44s)]
*  To close down my speech, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=643.52s)]
*  I am not afraid of you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=645.88s)]
*  And I'm coming for you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=648.36s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=653.16s)]
*  What do you think of Elon Musk so far? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=653.72s)]
*  Well, without Elon Musk, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=658.28s)]
*  Hunter Biden would still be. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=659.92s)]
*  And I can't say this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=662.28s)]
*  because I don't know the facts, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=663.2s)]
*  but it seems like he's been involved [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=664.68s)]
*  in some pretty interesting chicanery [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=666.64s)]
*  on behalf of the big guy, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=670.44s)]
*  whoever that may be. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=671.88s)]
*  We don't know for sure. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=674.88s)]
*  So I don't like to say things [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=676.16s)]
*  I'm not sure of. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=677.32s)]
*  But, you know, I think Elon Musk [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=678.92s)]
*  has very possibly, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=682.68s)]
*  very possibly saved America. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=686.16s)]
*  I think the ship of state [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=689.2s)]
*  has been on a course [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=690.84s)]
*  rivaling the Titanic. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=692.6s)]
*  And I think what Elon Musk has done [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=694.56s)]
*  is spend a lot of money [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=697.64s)]
*  like I did in that lawsuit [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=699.08s)]
*  against the guy who lied about me. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=700.44s)]
*  You know, you spend the money [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=702.08s)]
*  and say, I'm going to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=703.36s)]
*  I'm going to do this [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=704.6s)]
*  because it's so important to my. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=705.36s)]
*  Survival and my well-being. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=708.56s)]
*  And I think Elon Musk. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=710.92s)]
*  Loves this country. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=713.4s)]
*  It's clear that he does. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=715.4s)]
*  Why would he spend all that money on Twitter? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=716.76s)]
*  It's rat infected. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  App, you know, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=722.72s)]
*  why would he do that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=724.4399999999999s)]
*  unless he could see its value? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=725.72s)]
*  You have to understand something, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=728.28s)]
*  you know, back back [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=730.16s)]
*  when they have the power in Twitter, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=731.2s)]
*  the Democrats were happy to say, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=733.36s)]
*  well, it's a private site. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=734.88s)]
*  It's not it's not like it's the town square. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=736.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, they can say whatever they want. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=738.96s)]
*  Of course, they're not saying it now [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=740.6s)]
*  that that Elon Musk. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  But it was, in fact, the town square. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=745.0s)]
*  It was, in fact, a forum for free speech. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=748.0400000000001s)]
*  And if you have a town square [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=751.76s)]
*  or only some people are allowed to use it, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=753.44s)]
*  then you don't really have a free country. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=756.36s)]
*  We know in this country what it was like [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=759.12s)]
*  when certain citizens weren't allowed to speak, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=761.44s)]
*  when they had to step off the sidewalk [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=764.0400000000001s)]
*  because a person with different skin color [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=766.48s)]
*  was walking down the street, you know, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=768.72s)]
*  and I'm not going to compare anything [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  to what black people in America went through [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=773.44s)]
*  because there is no comparison. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  There is no comparison. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=779.48s)]
*  But it's, okay. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  James Woods, I don't know what to say other than thank you. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RsedoC_PN4&t=785.96s)]
