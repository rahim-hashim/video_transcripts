# Tucker: This is a slow motion disaster
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight. Happy Friday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=2.0s)]
*  If you've been following the news at all recently, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=4.0s)]
*  you know that Vladimir Putin [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=6.0s)]
*  is just seconds away from invading [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=8.0s)]
*  our ancient ally, our closest friend [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=10.0s)]
*  in the world stage. That would be the sovereign nation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=12.0s)]
*  of Ukraine. In response [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=14.0s)]
*  to this news, lovers of democracy everywhere [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=16.0s)]
*  are horrified. This [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=18.0s)]
*  is a slow motion disaster. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=20.0s)]
*  In effect, it's the first domino. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=22.0s)]
*  First, the Russians come from Ukraine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=24.0s)]
*  Next, it's Bangor, Boise, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=26.0s)]
*  Bakersfield. What Vladimir Putin [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=28.0s)]
*  plans next will make Red Dawn [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=30.0s)]
*  look like a documentary. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=32.0s)]
*  So of course, defenders of democracy everywhere [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=34.0s)]
*  are horrified by this. And they're ready to fight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=36.0s)]
*  Now NATO, whose job it apparently [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=38.0s)]
*  is to contain Russia, has not yet [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=40.0s)]
*  committed to defending Ukraine for some reason. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=42.0s)]
*  But patriotic Americans are not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=44.0s)]
*  waiting for NATO. That's not their way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=46.0s)]
*  According to a piece in Buzzfeed, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=48.0s)]
*  American citizens are joining the fight [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=50.0s)]
*  on their own. It's their [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=52.0s)]
*  Spanish Civil War. They're paying [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=54.0s)]
*  their way to Ukraine to defend the noble [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=56.0s)]
*  Ukrainian people against the dastardly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=58.0s)]
*  Russian hordes on the frozen steppe. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=60.0s)]
*  But strangely, and this [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=62.0s)]
*  is weird, we have no [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=64.0s)]
*  confirmation tonight that David Frum, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=66.0s)]
*  Max Boot, and Liz Cheney have left [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=68.0s)]
*  yet for Kiev. And maybe [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=70.0s)]
*  they're still oiling their rifles and gathering [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=72.0s)]
*  their kit. Or maybe they've [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=74.0s)]
*  decided to man the cable news [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=76.0s)]
*  barricades. Just because they're technically [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=78.0s)]
*  behind the lines doesn't [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=80.0s)]
*  make their service less perilous or important. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=82.0s)]
*  And someday they're all going to get medals for the sacrifices [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=84.0s)]
*  they're now making in CNN studios in New [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=86.0s)]
*  York City. And we plan to cover that ceremony [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=88.0s)]
*  live. But in the meantime, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=90.0s)]
*  Joe Biden seems most worried of all. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=92.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is so panicked about what's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=94.0s)]
*  about to happen to Ukraine, he makes Bill [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=96.0s)]
*  Kristol seem understated and restrained. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=98.0s)]
*  And that's not really surprising, because Joe [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=100.0s)]
*  Biden's the President of the United States. He's got [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=102.0s)]
*  access to all the latest Intel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=104.0s)]
*  It's delivered to him daily by the Weapons [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=106.0s)]
*  and Mass Destruction Division at CIA. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=108.0s)]
*  Those guys are on it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=110.0s)]
*  This week, Biden got so concerned [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=112.0s)]
*  after reading what the CIA delivered [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=114.0s)]
*  him, he's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=116.0s)]
*  so worried about what's about to happen [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=118.0s)]
*  to Ukraine that Joe Biden called the President of Ukraine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=120.0s)]
*  to warn him about his fate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=122.0s)]
*  And then someone in the Intel [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=124.0s)]
*  community leaked the transcript of that call to CNN. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=126.0s)]
*  Not for the first time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=128.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=130.0s)]
*  We have breaking news for you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=132.0s)]
*  and our world leader, senior Ukrainian official [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=134.0s)]
*  tells CNN that today's phone call [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=136.0s)]
*  between President Biden and Ukrainian President [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=138.0s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, quote, did [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=140.0s)]
*  not go well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=142.0s)]
*  Our source tells CNN that the two disagreed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=144.0s)]
*  about the immediacy of the threat [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=146.0s)]
*  of a Russian attack on Ukraine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=148.0s)]
*  The White House and Pentagon have been emphatic [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=150.0s)]
*  that they believe an attack could be imminent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=152.0s)]
*  We should note the White House just released [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=154.0s)]
*  its own readout of that call. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=156.0s)]
*  And there was no mention of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=158.0s)]
*  President Biden's warnings or the two [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=160.0s)]
*  presidents' disagreements. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=162.0s)]
*  Whoa! First we should note [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=164.0s)]
*  that CNN is perfectly capable of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=166.0s)]
*  taking spin-filled propaganda [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=168.0s)]
*  calls from agents of the Ukrainian [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=170.0s)]
*  government, but you can't talk to Russia because that's treason. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=172.0s)]
*  But here's the headline. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=174.0s)]
*  It looks like there is daylight between [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=176.0s)]
*  the world's two closest leaders. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=178.0s)]
*  Brothers, really. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=180.0s)]
*  And that suggests there might be a breach in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=182.0s)]
*  unbreakable bond forged over centuries [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=184.0s)]
*  between Ukraine and the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=186.0s)]
*  Listen to this from CNN's Natasha Bertrand. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=188.0s)]
*  She did this reporting, quote, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=190.0s)]
*  Prairie's senior Ukrainian official, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=192.0s)]
*  Biden told President Zelensky that a Russian [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=194.0s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine is now virtually certain [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=196.0s)]
*  and that Kiev could be sacked. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=198.0s)]
*  Prepare for impact, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=200.0s)]
*  Biden reportedly said. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=202.0s)]
*  President Zelensky disagreed and as I reported [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=204.0s)]
*  asked him to tone down the rhetoric. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=206.0s)]
*  What? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=208.0s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=210.0s)]
*  is more worried about Russia [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=212.0s)]
*  than the president of Ukraine is? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=214.0s)]
*  It looks that way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=216.0s)]
*  Because not long after that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=218.0s)]
*  reporting, CNN's Natasha Bertrand deleted [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=220.0s)]
*  that tweet. Oh. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=222.0s)]
*  And then an hour later, CNN's Jim [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=224.0s)]
*  Shuto contradicted CNN's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=226.0s)]
*  own previous reporting. He tweeted out this White [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=228.0s)]
*  House statement, which CNN qualifies as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=230.0s)]
*  reporting a statement from the White House. Here's what it said. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=232.0s)]
*  White House on Biden-Zelensky call [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=234.0s)]
*  anonymous sources are leaking falsehoods. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=236.0s)]
*  The only person who should be sacked is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=238.0s)]
*  the anonymous source who is circulating an inaccurate [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=240.0s)]
*  portrayal of this conversation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=242.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=244.0s)]
*  Not an actual denial, therefore it's true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=246.0s)]
*  It's an amazing sequence [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=248.0s)]
*  really if you think about it. So Biden [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=250.0s)]
*  tells the Ukrainian president that his capital [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=252.0s)]
*  city is about to be sacked [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=254.0s)]
*  like Rome in the 5th century. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=256.0s)]
*  Blood and screams, fire, spears [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=258.0s)]
*  and swords, seizures and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=260.0s)]
*  trebuchets. A horrible scene. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=262.0s)]
*  And Ukrainians lead a response to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=264.0s)]
*  this? Calm down dude, you're freaking me [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=266.0s)]
*  out. Toughen up, you sound like a terrified [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=268.0s)]
*  old woman. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=270.0s)]
*  Now the White House claims that conversation never [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=272.0s)]
*  happened, but clearly it did happen [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=274.0s)]
*  because at a press conference today [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=276.0s)]
*  President Zelensky said virtually the same thing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=278.0s)]
*  to the media. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=280.0s)]
*  So David Frum and Joe Biden have gotten Americans so whipped into a frenzy over the future of Ukraine that they're flying to Ukraine to risk their lives in defense of that sacred nation's sovereignty. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=310.0s)]
*  And there's the president of Ukraine saying we're not that concerned. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=328.0s)]
*  So what can we infer from this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=332.0s)]
*  Well it's simple. If you're not terrified about the prospect of a Russian invasion, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=334.0s)]
*  of Ukraine, the question is who's side are you on here? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=339.0s)]
*  Who's side are you on? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=341.0s)]
*  And we know the answer to that question. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=343.0s)]
*  You're on Vladimir Putin's side. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=345.0s)]
*  So it looks like the president of Ukraine [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=347.0s)]
*  himself has been compromised [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=349.0s)]
*  by Russian misinformation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=351.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian president is what we on cable news refer to as an agent of Putin. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=353.0s)]
*  And that means the Russians are so diabolically effective they have recruited the guy they're preparing war against. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=359.0s)]
*  How clever is that? It would take a Slavic mind to pull that off. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=367.0s)]
*  And by the way, yes, we are calling the president of Ukraine an agent of Putin, but we're not judging him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=370.0s)]
*  In fact, we can relate. We can empathize. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=375.0s)]
*  Because as you know, if you watch the media, we're agents of Putin too. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=377.0s)]
*  Fox's chief propagandist, Tucker Carlson, saying that the U.S. should be siding with Russia over Ukraine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=381.0s)]
*  What, you may say? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=388.0s)]
*  You may say members of Congress are actually getting phone calls encouraging them to side with Russia [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=390.0s)]
*  because they're watching right-wing media and people like Tucker Carlson. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=397.0s)]
*  It is striking how neatly Kremlin propaganda seems to dovetail with Carlson's talking points. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=401.0s)]
*  When Tucker Carlson delivers this message, it's dangerous. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=406.0s)]
*  Tucker seems to have some sort of larger pattern here with tyrants who lean to the right. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=409.0s)]
*  But why is he so committed and why is Fox News on his behalf so committed to tearing down [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=414.0s)]
*  the American embrace and support and alignment with the world's democracies? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=421.0s)]
*  Tucker is utterly shameless. If he had any capacity to feel any shame, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=428.0s)]
*  he should be embarrassed by what he just said because he is basically repeating rank Russian propaganda. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=433.0s)]
*  Mr. Max Boot, ladies and gentlemen, in his final domestic television appearance [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=442.0s)]
*  before he heads to Ukraine to defend that nation himself, its territorial integrity from the aggression of Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=446.0s)]
*  Watch him while you can. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=453.0s)]
*  But let's be clear about what the terms are. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=455.0s)]
*  In the United States, and this does not apply to Ukraine where they have probably a more sane view of it, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=457.0s)]
*  or maybe just more Russian influence view of it, but in the United States, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=462.0s)]
*  if you raise any questions about the wisdom of siding in a war in Eastern Europe with one country over another, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=465.0s)]
*  you are by definition an agent of the single greatest threat to democracy on this globe, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=475.0s)]
*  Mr. Vladimir Putin himself. You're treasonous. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=480.0s)]
*  Congressman Tom Malinowski of New Jersey is claiming that viewers of this show, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=485.0s)]
*  Russian robots to a man reached out to his office and did something horrifying, something that probably should be illegal. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=490.0s)]
*  They said maybe we shouldn't go to war over Ukraine. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=497.0s)]
*  Can you just tell us about these phone calls that your office is getting? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=501.0s)]
*  This? Yeah, sure. It really started yesterday. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=506.0s)]
*  I was in my district office in New Jersey and phones were ringing and my district director came to me and said, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=509.0s)]
*  I just spent an hour on the phone with like four people telling me that they'd watched Tucker Carlson last night. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=517.0s)]
*  And why are we going to be going to war for Ukraine? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=523.0s)]
*  Russia is making reasonable proposals for peace and we should just do what Russia wants. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of people have said Tom Malinowski, you know, is not the sharpest drawer in knife in the drawer, right? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=533.0s)]
*  Even by the standards of New Jersey. However, he makes a really good point. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=542.0s)]
*  There are people out there who look around and decide maybe, I don't know, homelessness, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=545.0s)]
*  close to a million people living on the street in the United States, 100,000 Americans dying of drug ODs, inflation. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=552.0s)]
*  The fact our schools haven't taught anything in over two years. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=559.0s)]
*  Maybe these are more important concerns than the territorial integrity of a country we can't find on a map. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=562.0s)]
*  Maybe our own territorial integrity is more important than Ukraine's. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=568.0s)]
*  And the question, as Congressman Malinowski raises, is why would they ever think that? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=572.0s)]
*  Where would they get the idea that their stupid parochial domestic concerns are more important than Ukraine's eastern border? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=576.0s)]
*  And the answer, of course, is Vladimir Putin. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=584.0s)]
*  They've obviously fallen for the Russian propaganda. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=586.0s)]
*  That would be us doing Vladimir Putin's bidding. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0z55whpRvg&t=590.0s)]
