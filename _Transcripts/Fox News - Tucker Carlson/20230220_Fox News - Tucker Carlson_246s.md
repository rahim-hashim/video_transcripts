# Tucker: It looks like things are over for Mr. Don Lemon
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds)
*  So we don't wish anyone ill really in the television business, such a volatile business. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't ever want to root for someone's firing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=4.8s)]
*  But it's hard not to notice that there is a lot of drama at CNN. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=7.2s)]
*  First, their top star in prime time, Chris Cuomo, was fired. Not exactly why. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=10.24s)]
*  Then CNN Plus blew up, costing the company hundreds of millions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=15.36s)]
*  And then Brian Stelter got canned if there was ever a firing to celebrate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=19.28s)]
*  It would have been his. But even we didn't celebrate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And now to wreck our day, it looks like Mr. Don Lamont, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=24.32s)]
*  the source of endless entertainment for us for many, many years, is out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=28.16s)]
*  He made the mistake of saying that women over 50 are not in their prime. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=32.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, they can have babies too. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=36.4s)]
*  So without even taking sides in that debate or being too literal about it, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=38.4s)]
*  the bottom line is it looks like it's over for Don Lamont. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=41.92s)]
*  He was not on the air today, which is bad if you're a TV host. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=44.8s)]
*  Here's how his co-hosts explain why he wasn't there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Poland, where the president will be shortly. Don has the day off. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=58.63999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, no offense to the ladies on the set, but are we on it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Let's be honest, are we going to kind of miss Don Lamont if he's fired? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=68.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=71.12s)]
*  Steve Krakauer has covered television for a long time and really well. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=72.24s)]
*  And honestly, he's the author of Uncovered. He joins us saying, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=75.92s)]
*  Hey, Steve, so what what's going on? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=78.64s)]
*  And again, we're not gloating in any way, but I know that you would know the answer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=80.88s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  It seems like the place is on the way to to collapsing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, Tucker, I was a colleague of Don Lamont, as you say, not too long ago, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=88.16s)]
*  less than 10 years ago. And it seems like there's been, you know, a real fundamental [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=93.28s)]
*  shift at the network. I mean, it started only three or four years after I left during the Trump era. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  I think one of the biggest examples during the Trump era of the media that really just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=102.08s)]
*  just went off the rails. I write about it an entire chapter on it, not just my experience, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=107.12s)]
*  but chapter of the experience of other people that worked at the network and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  what happened there as well. And now you have Don. Don was one of the stars of that era of CNN. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  He was a big prime time host. He's already been relegated to the morning show now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  And it's sort of this relic of the old administration that's being trying to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  dig themselves out of. Don was a big star. He was like an influencer. And this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  this really is one of the big problems of the media in general right now. Don kind of bought [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=132.0s)]
*  his own hype. And I think that when he made that comment about Nikki Haley, he thought he was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=137.2s)]
*  criticizing a Republican. He thought he was criticizing someone you're allowed to criticize, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=142.16s)]
*  when in reality he didn't realize he's criticizing basically all women and now all of his colleagues [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=145.76s)]
*  are mad at him. So I think it's a big problem with digging themselves out of this hole that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=150.56s)]
*  they brought themselves into because of a lot of factors that happened only a few years ago during [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=155.12s)]
*  the Trump administration. I mean, Don Lamont is dumb and kind of crazy, but he's always been. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=160.24s)]
*  And that's sort of the appeal. So if you put someone who's dumb and kind of crazy on TV, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=166.8s)]
*  you expect them to say dumb and kind of crazy things. And like, that's hilarious. What was his [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=171.04s)]
*  crime exactly? Yeah, I do wonder if in the olden days, which again, we're talking about a few years [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  ago, back when, you know, when things were going so much better for Don Lamont, as you say, this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  sort of thing might have been swept under the rug, you know, I mean, it'll just stack up what he said [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=187.44s)]
*  about Nikki Haley with all of the things he said about Donald Trump or other people in that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=191.6s)]
*  administration. I mean, it's not even close. So but I do think that there's a new mandate there. And [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Don sort of out of favor right now, because it's just not really the direction of the network. I [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=199.68s)]
*  mean, you know, we've saw during the Trump era, and we've seen since then a total lack of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  introspection, I get at this in Uncovered, just about every story. I mean, they make mistakes, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=208.24s)]
*  and they don't apologize. And then it just the trust in the media just keeps getting lower and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=212.4s)]
*  lower. And obviously, CNN is trying to dig themselves out. They need to improve their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=216.72s)]
*  ratings. It's kind of in the tank right now. Don is kind of a he might be a casualty of that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=220.72s)]
*  Yeah. And Nikki Haley is a crazed neocon. And you're not allowed to criticize them, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=226.32s)]
*  I've noticed. So that may play a role too. Steve Krakow, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=230.56s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnL33QH_Fds&t=233.84s)]
