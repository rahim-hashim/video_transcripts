# The reach of Jeffrey Epstein's operation could be 'earth-shattering'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo)
*  So there's been a lot of leaking from the DOJ recently, but somehow the Justice Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=0.0s)]
*  has not leaked anything really about Jeffrey Epstein, including his client list. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=5.16s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, Elon Musk, a big picture man if there ever was one, asked that question recently, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=11.52s)]
*  quote, the only thing more remarkable than DOJ not leaking the list is that no one in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=15.52s)]
*  the media cares, he wrote. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=19.36s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=21.28s)]
*  And while we're on the topic of Epstein, why did Bruce Reinhart, the magistrate judge who [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=23.02s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago raid represent several of Jeffrey Epstein's employees, including his pilot and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=27.5s)]
*  his schedule? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=32.5s)]
*  Huh, weird. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=33.5s)]
*  Bobby Capucci is a podcast host who is doggedly following this story. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=36.78s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=41.36s)]
*  Bobby, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=42.36s)]
*  So you follow this full time, one of the few who does. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=44.36s)]
*  Why haven't we gotten any of this information in the form of leaks to the New York Times, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=47.22s)]
*  do you think? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Well, in my opinion, it has to do with how far it goes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=54.22s)]
*  This is such a gigantic in scope operation that he was running that if they really dug [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=58.5s)]
*  deep that it would be almost earth shattering what they would discover. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=64.54s)]
*  If you take a look at some of the similar cases in New York at a similar time for similar [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=71.26s)]
*  crimes, R. Kelly or Keith Rainieri, both were hit with RICO charges. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=75.5s)]
*  But Epstein, Maxwell, no RICO there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=80.34s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=83.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of weird. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=85.42s)]
*  I mean, they they grabbed some Alex Jones's text the other day. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=86.42s)]
*  And the line is that Alex Jones is the real criminal, not Jeffrey Epstein, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=89.78s)]
*  But the second they got his text, you know, you know, everything, everything embarrassing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  thing he's ever said, of course, is going to be in the New York Times. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=98.1s)]
*  But they are affirmatively protecting Jeffrey Epstein, who's not even alive anymore. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  It's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=107.94s)]
*  It's been going on all the way since the Vanity Fair article back in 2002, the puff piece [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=110.78s)]
*  on on Jeffrey Epstein back then. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=115.41999999999999s)]
*  You know, Maria Farmer outed this guy in 1995, 1996. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=117.74s)]
*  Nobody followed up on it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=122.74s)]
*  Nobody ever pursued him the way they should have. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  And it was all happening right under the nose of the SDNY, who loves to get on their ivory [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=126.72s)]
*  tower and preach down to the rest of us on a regular basis about how bad we live our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=131.1s)]
*  lives. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=135.42s)]
*  You know, this guy was running around in their district for four presidencies, hanging out [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=136.42s)]
*  at the White House, you know, they're all of it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=141.1s)]
*  And nobody cares what's going on until the survivors themselves decide to go and take [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  the case to the people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=148.26s)]
*  And we see what's happened since then. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=149.61999999999998s)]
*  There's been an avalanche effect and they've had to react to it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=151.38s)]
*  Really quick. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=155.26s)]
*  You keep reading suggestions that there is a trove of videotape of other people at Epstein's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=156.26s)]
*  properties. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=162.66s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=163.66s)]
*  Well, what I can tell you is all of the survivors who had access to his townhouse, all of them [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  that had access to Palm Beach, they all said that there were surveillance rooms in those [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  houses set up for that specific purpose, to take video of everybody who came in and to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=176.26s)]
*  document it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=181.14s)]
*  So we're talking about the people that actually lived through this telling us that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  And nobody cares. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=186.42s)]
*  We have, I mean, when the Daily Mail is leading the charge to go after somebody like Prince [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=187.42s)]
*  And not the Grey Lady or the Washington Post. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=192.5s)]
*  That tells you everything you need to know about where the legacy media is at. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=195.3s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=199.3s)]
*  And of course, he was connected to various intelligence agencies, which might be the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=200.3s)]
*  real answer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=203.86s)]
*  Bobby, I appreciate your staying on this story when few others are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=204.86s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMPOyN5dPo&t=208.38s)]
