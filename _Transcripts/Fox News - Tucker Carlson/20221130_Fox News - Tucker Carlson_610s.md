# Tucker Carlson: The real criminals are getting richer
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=0.0s)]
*  Today we're going to start with a quiz. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=2.0s)]
*  What do you have when you find Sam Bankman Fried, Janet Yellen, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=3.72s)]
*  and President Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=8.36s)]
*  all together in one room? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=10.36s)]
*  A federal grand jury proceeding? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=12.76s)]
*  That would be a good guess. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=15.36s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried seems to have committed the biggest [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=16.88s)]
*  financial fraud in history. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=18.92s)]
*  As the chair of the Federal Reserve, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Janet Yellen bears direct responsibility [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=23.32s)]
*  for the destruction of the entire US economy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=25.16s)]
*  President Zelensky, meanwhile, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=27.4s)]
*  sits atop a money laundering scheme so brazen [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=29.08s)]
*  that Democrats won't even allow it to be audited. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=32.08s)]
*  So yes, these are three people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=35.4s)]
*  who could badly use a federal investigation, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=37.08s)]
*  but they're not getting one. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Instead, they're being celebrated, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  held up as uniquely fascinating people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=42.16s)]
*  by the New York Times. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=44.76s)]
*  In case you missed it, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=46.56s)]
*  today was the annual Dealbook Summit. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=47.4s)]
*  That's a money-making event the newspaper advertises [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=49.36s)]
*  as a symposium with quote, top business leaders. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=52.16s)]
*  Tickets went for 2,500 bucks apiece. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=55.72s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried, Janet Yellen, and Vladimir Zelensky [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  were all there, apparently in their capacity [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=61.64s)]
*  as top business leaders. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=63.44s)]
*  Thank you so very much, exclaimed the moderator, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=65.68s)]
*  Andrew Ross Sorkin, when Sam Bankman Fried finished speaking. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=68.24s)]
*  Thank you, Sam Bankman Fried, everybody. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=72.08s)]
*  And with that, the audience applauded heartily. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=75.28s)]
*  New York Times readers were clearly impressed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=77.88s)]
*  by the Democratic mega-donor, Sam Bankman Fried, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  who also happens to be one of the most prolific thieves [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=82.36s)]
*  of all time, but whatever. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=84.76s)]
*  He seemed like a nice kid. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=85.76s)]
*  It was a pretty amazing display. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=88.72s)]
*  But what's most interesting about an event like this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=90.92s)]
*  is not what it tells us about the guests. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=93.12s)]
*  At some point, history will render its judgment about them, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  but what it tells us about the people who invited the guests. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=97.72s)]
*  If it's okay to treat Sam Bankman Fried [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=101.2s)]
*  like just another naughty celebrity, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=103.92s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried, everybody, applause, applause, applause. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=105.72s)]
*  If you can do that, then who's off limits? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Who's beyond the pale? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, as it happens, the New York Times has spent [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=114.84s)]
*  the last few days telling us, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=116.84s)]
*  delivering yet another hyperventilating lecture [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=119.0s)]
*  about who we're allowed to associate with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  and who we must avoid at all costs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  And it really depends on political loyalty. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Some people, the New York Times has explained, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  have views that are so reprehensible, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  these people are physically off limits. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=132.28s)]
*  You cannot be in the same room with people like that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=133.8s)]
*  You can't talk to them, you can't ask them questions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=136.44s)]
*  Their opinions are like smallpox, communicable and deadly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=139.4s)]
*  These are the thought criminals, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  and thought crimes are the only crimes that matter. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=145.64s)]
*  Other crimes, not such a big deal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=147.8s)]
*  Murder and rape and carjacking, nah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=150.0s)]
*  As the New York Times has often told us, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=153.64s)]
*  people who do those things are the victims of your racism. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=155.6s)]
*  So they deserve compassion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=159.68s)]
*  So by the way, do good liberals who stray outside the lines. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=161.2s)]
*  Good liberals can always be forgiven, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=164.32s)]
*  even when the things they've done [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=166.68s)]
*  are objectively very, very bad, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=168.04s)]
*  like tanking the US economy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=170.32s)]
*  or stealing billions from investors [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=172.88s)]
*  and using it to buy Bahamian real estate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=174.64s)]
*  or bringing the entire world to the brink of nuclear war [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  and getting rich while you do it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Liberals can still do these things [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=181.44s)]
*  and you can still heartily applaud them [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=183.28s)]
*  because in the end, you know, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=185.68s)]
*  their hearts are in the right place. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=187.04s)]
*  They believe the right things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=188.44s)]
*  So with that in mind, it probably is not a surprise [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=191.6s)]
*  that no one at the New York Times [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=194.32s)]
*  bothered to ask Zelensky today [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=195.82s)]
*  where exactly all the money has gone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=197.24s)]
*  No one demanded an accounting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  of the billions of your tax dollars [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=201.62s)]
*  that seemed to have disappeared into the pockets [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  of Ukrainian oligarchs in track suits [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=205.62s)]
*  because asking would have been rude. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=207.94s)]
*  He was our guest. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=210.06s)]
*  So instead, the New York Times gave Zelensky an opportunity [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  to demand much more of your money, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=214.94s)]
*  which of course he promptly took. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  On November 15th, the Biden administration [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=221.1s)]
*  submitted a new aid request of $37.7 billion, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  which if passed would bring the total amount [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=227.5s)]
*  that the U.S. has provided in assistance [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=229.36s)]
*  to $105.5 billion. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=234.36s)]
*  We're gonna be speaking with former Vice President [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=237.96s)]
*  Mike Pence a little bit later [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=239.84s)]
*  and there has been a sentiment among Republicans [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=241.28s)]
*  who now control the House in the United States [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  from Kevin McCarthy who said, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  there should not be a blank check. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=248.36s)]
*  What do you tell them? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=251.28000000000003s)]
*  We are absolutely open and we are thankful for the assistance. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=252.4s)]
*  It's not quite correct to speak about $100 billion [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=260.56s)]
*  as a value of the war for the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=266.36s)]
*  The value is lives of people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=268.8s)]
*  If Ukraine does not stand through this war, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=272.8s)]
*  the war will spread into other territories [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=275.8s)]
*  and maybe even in the United States. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=278.08s)]
*  And maybe even to other continents. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=281.4s)]
*  Our people is the biggest value. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Tell me how much our people cost. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=287.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=289.4s)]
*  Okay, so support me or Putin's gonna invade Atlanta. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=294.12s)]
*  And by the way, you have no choice [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=298.32s)]
*  because if you object to sending billions more [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=299.4s)]
*  to the very people who gave a no-show job to a hundred Biden, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=301.64s)]
*  you're a bad person. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=304.44s)]
*  You don't care about Ukrainian lives. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  You're a moral monster. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=308.32s)]
*  Now, moral blackmail, this crude, does not typically work [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=311.2s)]
*  because nobody with self-respect would stand for it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=317.84s)]
*  Settle down, son. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=318.68s)]
*  Get the Germans to pay for it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=319.52s)]
*  It's their continent. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=320.56s)]
*  That's what a normal person would say, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=321.64s)]
*  someone who had self-respect. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately for the rest of us, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=325.56s)]
*  Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas has no self-respect. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  So he folded immediately. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  And that matters because McCaul is the top Republican [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=331.52s)]
*  on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=333.96s)]
*  So just in case that you imagined [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=336.12s)]
*  that throwing out Nancy Pelosi [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  and electing a Republican Congress, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=339.28s)]
*  a huge victory, would mean that somebody would push back [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  against Joe Biden's lunatic [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  and completely anti-American foreign policy priorities. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, you were mistaken [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  because Michael McCaul just informed us [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=351.84s)]
*  that because we're good people, and so was Zelensky, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=353.52s)]
*  we're gonna be sending Mr. Zelensky [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=356.84s)]
*  and his pals in tracksuits billions more of your money. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=358.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  And I wanna pick up where Colonel Milburn left off. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=363.23999999999995s)]
*  He believes that there should be longer range weapons [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  sent to Ukraine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  Would you approve of that? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=372.12s)]
*  100%, he's absolutely correct. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=374.0s)]
*  I mean, my criticism of this administration [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=375.84s)]
*  was before the invasion, we wouldn't put weapons in. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=378.2s)]
*  And since the invasion, we've slow-walked this process. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=380.96s)]
*  We are gonna provide more oversight, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=384.24s)]
*  transparency, and accountability. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=386.67999999999995s)]
*  We're not gonna write a blank check. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=388.76s)]
*  Does that diminish our will to help the Ukraine people fight? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  No, but we're gonna do it in a responsible way. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=394.84s)]
*  And I think it's very important [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=397.56s)]
*  that the American people understand what's at stake here. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  So the U.S. military, not Ukraine's military, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  our military, the one that's supposed to protect our country, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  is running out of equipment and manpower. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  But just so we're all clear [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=411.0s)]
*  about what Michael McCaul's priorities are, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  we're sending advanced weapons systems, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=414.88s)]
*  yet more of them, to Ukraine. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's in addition to what we've already sent, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=418.44s)]
*  which is bigger than the entire Russian military budget. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=420.08s)]
*  So if that's not insulting enough, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  and of course the point of this is to insult you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=424.2s)]
*  and to degrade you and to make you fully aware [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=425.88s)]
*  that your country's interests come last [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=428.44s)]
*  because you come last on the list of priorities, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=430.88s)]
*  they're going farther than that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=434.84s)]
*  We've also decided to pay Ukraine's energy bills. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=436.4s)]
*  Now, it's kind of odd that we're doing that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=439.56s)]
*  at a time when we have our first real energy crisis [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  since the mid-1970s, a manufactured crisis, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=443.44s)]
*  but a crisis nevertheless, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=446.56s)]
*  a crisis that is causing Americans to freeze in their homes [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=447.96s)]
*  because they can't afford heating oil. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=450.68s)]
*  That means it's a perfect time to send energy [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=452.72s)]
*  to our friends in Ukraine and the whole region. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=456.16s)]
*  Here's Tony Blinken. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=458.32000000000005s)]
*  I announced that the United States will commit [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=459.92s)]
*  over $53 million to send equipment [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=461.48s)]
*  to help stabilize Ukraine's energy grid [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=465.0s)]
*  and keep Ukraine's power and electricity running. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  We've also submitted a request to Congress [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  for $1.1 billion to secure Ukraine [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  and Moldova's energy sector and restore their energy supply. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=474.68s)]
*  So why is this continuing when of course Joe Biden [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  could call Zelensky, who effectively works for him, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=482.48s)]
*  I mean, close family connections there of course, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  his son worked in Ukraine, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  could call Zelensky and say, no, no, Maas, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=489.6s)]
*  get the money from Europe or let's wrap this thing up. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=494.16s)]
*  The rebuilding costs of this country [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=495.56s)]
*  are beyond what we can pay. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=497.12s)]
*  This is really a dead end. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=498.56s)]
*  Let's come to a settlement. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=499.76s)]
*  And of course, that could happen in about a week [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=500.88s)]
*  if they wanted it to, but they don't want that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  They want the war to keep going. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=505.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=506.72s)]
*  Oh, because everyone's getting rich. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=507.56s)]
*  And so the one thing you're not allowed to say is that, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=510.72s)]
*  hey, maybe we should stop this war [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=513.88s)]
*  because of course the cash spigot would stop flowing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=517.76s)]
*  And that's why at the Dealbook Summit, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=520.72s)]
*  the top business leader, Zelensky, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=523.72s)]
*  in fact, he is really a top business leader [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=525.6s)]
*  if you want to be honest about it, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=527.2s)]
*  went after Elon Musk because Elon Musk suggested [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=528.56s)]
*  maybe we should get a peace deal. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=532.12s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=533.84s)]
*  It seems that Elon began to change his opinion [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=535.2s)]
*  and we began to hear all kinds of appeals. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=539.2s)]
*  I don't know if somebody is making an influence on him [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=542.68s)]
*  or he's making those choices himself. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=546.72s)]
*  I always say very openly, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=549.76s)]
*  if you want to understand what Russia has done here, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=553.08s)]
*  come to Ukraine and you will see this with your own eyes [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=555.76s)]
*  without any extra words. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=559.92s)]
*  And after that, you will tell us how to end this war, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=562.28s)]
*  who started it and when we can end it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=566.64s)]
*  Oh, all perfectly reasonable. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=570.84s)]
*  Can't have peace, send more billions. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=572.64s)]
*  So what's interesting is that this last few days [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=577.16s)]
*  has been like the few days before that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=580.36s)]
*  There's been a lot of moral outrage in Washington [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=583.4s)]
*  about bad ideas. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=586.48s)]
*  And of course, some ideas are bad on both sides for sure. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=587.48s)]
*  But ideas aren't criminal, actions are criminal. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  And as always, the real criminals are getting away with it [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=594.88s)]
*  and getting richer in the process. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwG9sSfjxg&t=598.4399999999999s)]
