# Tucker: This will destroy civilization as we know it
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8)
*  So Donald Trump and Alex Jones and a whole lot of other people are no longer allowed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=0.0s)]
*  on Twitter, but Justin Trudeau is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=5.66s)]
*  He's the Prime Minister of Canada. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=9.1s)]
*  Now that's unfair, of course, but it's also interesting because Trudeau is way crazier [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=10.3s)]
*  than any of the people who have been banned from Twitter that we're aware of. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=14.24s)]
*  But you can see him think in real time, and that's kind of cool. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=17.68s)]
*  It tells you a lot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=20.94s)]
*  He just sent this tweet out, quote, people across the country are lighting candles to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=22.56s)]
*  honor indigenous women, girls, and two S-L-G-B-T-Q-Q-I-A plus plus. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=25.94s)]
*  Now that's a group, a so-called community. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=35.3s)]
*  Most of these communities, by the way, consist of people who've got nothing in common with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  each other and don't even know each other. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=41.68s)]
*  They're no meetings or anything. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=43.06s)]
*  They're not real communities. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=44.06s)]
*  They're constructs of politicians. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=45.06s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=46.92s)]
*  What the hell is he talking about? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  One of the chances Justin Trudeau has no idea what he's talking about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=51.42s)]
*  He's not even sure how you're supposed to say that acronym. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=54.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=57.04s)]
*  I will never apologize for standing up for an L-G-D-P-L-G-T-L-B-T-L-G-B-T-Q-2 plus [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=58.04s)]
*  kids rights. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=69.8s)]
*  It's all pretty great. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=73.48s)]
*  Also a little terrifying. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=74.48s)]
*  Gad Saad is a very interesting personal professor, author of the new book, The Parasitic Mind, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=75.48s)]
*  How Infectious Ideas Are Killing Common Sense. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=81.12s)]
*  And boy, is that true. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=83.6s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=84.6s)]
*  We appreciate your being here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  So what do you make of the Prime Minister of Canada coming out with a vehement defense [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=88.52s)]
*  of an endorsement of a group whose name he can't even pronounce or define? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=94.16s)]
*  Well, it's part and parcel of his moral confusion and moral hypocrisy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  When he was a parliamentarian, when Stephen Harper was prime minister, Justin Trudeau [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  got very upset because Stephen Harper referred to honor killings and child bride and female [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=110.48s)]
*  genital mutilation as barbaric. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=116.68s)]
*  Justin Trudeau wasn't angry at those acts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=118.92s)]
*  He was angry that Stephen Harper would call them barbaric. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=121.56s)]
*  So that gives you a sense of his moral compass. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  So it's not about protecting human rights, which I think all of us would be strongly [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  for. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=133.96s)]
*  I certainly would. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=134.96s)]
*  It's about elevating some groups and hurting others. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=135.96s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=140.36s)]
*  And I mean, I see this all through my scientific career. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=141.36s)]
*  It is no longer about judging the when you apply for a scientific grant, it's no longer [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=144.28s)]
*  about the worth of the scientific application. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  It's about whether you adhere to certain diversity, inclusion and equity edicts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  So these dreadful ideas, these parasitic ideas have real world consequences. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=158.38000000000002s)]
*  They start off in the esoteric world of the ivory tower, but eventually they break out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  and now they infect every nook and cranny of our societies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=168.32s)]
*  I hope that our audience will take a look at your book in which you lay this out in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=172.48s)]
*  some great detail, but I just have to sum up by asking the obvious question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=176.4s)]
*  Is this slowing down or is it picking up steam? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=179.7s)]
*  Do you see an end to this? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=182.24s)]
*  I mean, it is picking up regrettably, but I am optimistic in that I truly believe that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=186.24s)]
*  the silent majority despises this stuff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=191.04s)]
*  If we can activate our inner honey badger and speak in unison, we'll get rid of these [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=193.72s)]
*  parasitic ideas by next Tuesday. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=198.24s)]
*  If we don't, it'll be a slow train ride to hell. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=200.02s)]
*  What a great, I'm glad I asked that question. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=204.96s)]
*  What a great, if we can activate our inner honey badgers, we can end this by next Tuesday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=206.52s)]
*  But if we don't, it's a train to hell. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=212.36s)]
*  Well, that's put that on the fridge. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=214.56s)]
*  Godson, appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=216.92s)]
*  Congrats on the book. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=218.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=220.8s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70Pd4LQIq8&t=221.8s)]
