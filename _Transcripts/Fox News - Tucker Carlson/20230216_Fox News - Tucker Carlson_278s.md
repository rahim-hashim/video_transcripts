# Hazardous waste expert tells Tucker Ohio town was 'nuked'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw)
*  How bad is this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, it does take some experience with the chemistry [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=1.72s)]
*  to really know that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=5.12s)]
*  Sil Kajiano is an expert in this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  He's a hazardous waste authority. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=8.84s)]
*  He says the town of East Palestine [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=10.52s)]
*  has effectively been nuked. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=12.14s)]
*  He joins us tonight to explain what that means. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=13.64s)]
*  Sil, I appreciate your coming on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=16.4s)]
*  How do you, having spent your life [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  assessing things like chemical spills, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=21.92s)]
*  how do you assess the condition of East Palestine tonight? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  It's very troublesome. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=28.14s)]
*  These poor individuals, through no fault of their own, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=30.42s)]
*  became victims of systemic failures [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=33.5s)]
*  within the rail transportation system. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=36.14s)]
*  And it manifested itself in this mushroom cloud [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=40.02s)]
*  that they had to experience in their town. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=42.5s)]
*  One of the reasons why I made the comment about, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=46.7s)]
*  we nuked a town with chemicals is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=49.34s)]
*  because there was somebody from Darlington, Pennsylvania, who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=50.78s)]
*  was videoing the cloud that had went over his property. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=53.9s)]
*  And you could see fallout coming out of the cloud [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=58.22s)]
*  going onto his property. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  And I'm looking at it, and I'm saying, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=62.58s)]
*  it reminds you of one of those apocalyptic shows [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=64.58s)]
*  where the nuclear fallout's coming out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=67.42s)]
*  And I thought about it, and I says, well, yeah, we basically [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=69.66s)]
*  did nukle whole town just to get a railroad going back [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=71.9s)]
*  in service. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=76.24s)]
*  And earlier on, I got involved in this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=77.46s)]
*  because news media were not being told the truth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=80.86s)]
*  Days into this, no train consist was available. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=85.3s)]
*  They didn't know what they had. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=89.38s)]
*  And that flies in the face of logic. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=91.1s)]
*  If you're going to mitigate a problem, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=93.42s)]
*  if you're going to have your fire department and other [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=95.02s)]
*  responding teams take care of it, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=98.58s)]
*  you should know what the heck you've got. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=99.86s)]
*  And it got to the point where they're showing me [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=102.02s)]
*  pictures of train cars, the local media, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=104.34s)]
*  and I was identifying what was in based on UNID numbers [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=106.94s)]
*  or train car numbers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=110.14s)]
*  And when they told me their plan, at that point, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=112.06s)]
*  you had a few cars burning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=114.9s)]
*  They had unmonitored hand lines there keeping the tankers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=117.02s)]
*  cool. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=119.94s)]
*  And then I find out that they're pulling the unmonitored hand [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=120.9s)]
*  lines keeping the tankers cool. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=123.98s)]
*  So that's just going to cause the tanker cars [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=125.74s)]
*  to heat up, which they did. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=128.58s)]
*  And then they announced that one was very [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=130.86s)]
*  near catastrophic failure. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=133.18s)]
*  And I said, well, if they don't put water back on it, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=135.18s)]
*  it's going to continue to heat up, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=137.5s)]
*  and it's going to what's called a blevy, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=139.48s)]
*  and it's going to damage other containers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=141.64s)]
*  And then I was told, no, they're going to detonate all these [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=144.04s)]
*  cars so that it doesn't happen. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=146.16s)]
*  I could tell you, Mr. Carlson, I've [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  been looking at rail incidents over and over [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  because in Youngstown, Ohio, there's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=153.44s)]
*  three rail lines that run through our town. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  So as a chief and as a instructor, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=157.04s)]
*  I trained my guys to anticipate stuff. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=159.6s)]
*  And I would go case study after case study after case study, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  coming up with different scenarios [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  just to keep it going. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=167.64s)]
*  And I've never once in 39 years ever [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  heard of them blowing up train cars, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=171.72s)]
*  dumping all the chemicals into a trench, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=173.72s)]
*  and lighting them on fire. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=176.0s)]
*  I was dumbfounded. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=177.76s)]
*  And when you lit this stuff on fire, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=179.48s)]
*  you were creating phosgene. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  You were creating hydrogen chlorides. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  You created this plume. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=185.0s)]
*  And up in this plume was all the incomplete combustion [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  products of everything that was there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  If you looked at the guy's video, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  stuff is precipitating down into people's property. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=194.6s)]
*  There's a lot of questions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=198.4s)]
*  The answers came slow. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  And first you get, well, now we found [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=202.72s)]
*  vinyl chlorides in the water. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=206.08s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=207.36s)]
*  No joke. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=209.8s)]
*  You're going to find that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  And it seemed like everything was drips and dribbles. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=212.24s)]
*  Instead of one of the things I learned is you tell the truth, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=216.4s)]
*  you tell it all, you tell it first, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=219.44s)]
*  and you tell them how you're going to solve the problem. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=220.76s)]
*  And none of that was forthcoming. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=223.12s)]
*  And I began to worry about what the end result of this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=224.88s)]
*  was going to be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=228.68s)]
*  They had evacuated one mile. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  And I was telling the media, they better [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=231.84s)]
*  do like one and a half, two miles. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=233.48s)]
*  Well, subsequently after that, they went to two miles. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=234.96s)]
*  And then within a few minutes, or a few days, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=238.28s)]
*  they were bringing everybody back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=241.92s)]
*  And that was pretty much just in time to open up the rails. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=243.6s)]
*  And there was no testing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=246.92s)]
*  There's got to be some plan going forward [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=248.24s)]
*  in this cleanup and recovery to test. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=250.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=253.92s)]
*  I mean, if you find asbestos in your building, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=254.48s)]
*  you contain and remove it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=256.2s)]
*  You don't blow it into the next county. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=257.36s)]
*  It just seems self-evidently insane. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=259.52s)]
*  Sil, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=261.92s)]
*  That was really, really interesting and sad. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=263.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6CR9Dg7gw&t=266.96s)]
