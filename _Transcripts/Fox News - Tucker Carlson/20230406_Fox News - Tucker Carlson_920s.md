# Tucker: NPR has always been unbearable and cringey
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on Tuesday, two days ago, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=3.0s)]
*  Twitter slapped a warning label on all tweets [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=5.24s)]
*  from national public radio. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=8.2s)]
*  Going forward, NPR will be identified for users [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  of Elon Musk's social media site [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=13.16s)]
*  as quote, state affiliated media. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  That is the same category as Russia Today [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=17.96s)]
*  or China Central Television. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=20.6s)]
*  It means that NPR is not that different [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=22.8s)]
*  from the Tehran Times, with the exception of course, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=24.68s)]
*  being less accurate and more anti-American. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=27.0s)]
*  So that happened on Tuesday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=29.72s)]
*  Why are we telling you about it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=30.72s)]
*  With all the momentous changes underway around the world, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=32.18s)]
*  why would we open a show with a story [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=34.92s)]
*  about Twitter recategorizing NPR as state media? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=37.12s)]
*  Well, because it's true. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  That's the reason. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=43.76s)]
*  Finally, thankfully, somebody in authority [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=44.6s)]
*  has told the truth about something, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=47.7s)]
*  and that is thrilling to see on its own terms. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=49.8s)]
*  In a world defined by lies from our leaders, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=52.82s)]
*  this seemed like a rare sign of hope and progress. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=55.68s)]
*  Telling the truth is the most revolutionary act of all, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=60.08s)]
*  far more than taking up arms. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=63.12s)]
*  And yet you rarely see it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=65.38s)]
*  Human beings created language in order to describe [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=66.84s)]
*  the world around them more precisely than they could [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=68.82s)]
*  with say grunting or sign language, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=70.94s)]
*  but unfortunately have been subverting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=73.26s)]
*  our own creation ever since. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=74.82s)]
*  But not tonight. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  By calling national public radio what it is, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=78.52s)]
*  Elon Musk has used English as it was intended to be used [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=81.12s)]
*  in order to tell the truth. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=84.4s)]
*  Of course, NPR is state media. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=86.4s)]
*  Have you listened to it? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=88.88s)]
*  It has all the hallmarks, repetitive dishonesty, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=90.44s)]
*  authoritarian politics, unwavering devotion [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=93.82s)]
*  to the party in charge. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=97.08s)]
*  Of course, that could describe virtually all media [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  in this country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  The difference is the state actually pays for NPR. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=103.0s)]
*  NPR was created more than 50 years ago by a law [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=107.24s)]
*  signed by Democrat Lyndon Johnson. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=109.88s)]
*  It was called the Public Broadcasting Act. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=112.0s)]
*  And from its very first day, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=113.84s)]
*  NPR was wholly dependent on tax dollars [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=115.52s)]
*  in order to exist. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=118.8s)]
*  And it still is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Federal funding is essential to NPR, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=122.32s)]
*  explains NPR's own website. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  So there's no factual debate about that fact, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=128.76s)]
*  but there is a great deal of lying about it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=131.72s)]
*  Every year, NPR lobbyists head to Capitol Hill [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=135.0s)]
*  to demand more tax dollars. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=137.56s)]
*  Democracy can't exist without us, they screech. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  While simultaneously at the very same time, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=142.64s)]
*  telling you at high volume [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=144.54s)]
*  that NPR takes virtually no tax money. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=146.04s)]
*  So we don't need federal subsidies, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=149.44s)]
*  don't even want them really, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=151.16s)]
*  but you have to increase them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=152.68s)]
*  That is NPR's line and has been for decades [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=155.2s)]
*  under the political leadership of both parties. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=158.32s)]
*  And it's essentially unchallenged by anyone. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=161.28s)]
*  It just stays. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=163.86s)]
*  Wars and recessions come and go, but NPR funding remains. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=165.64s)]
*  But after more than half a century, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=169.96s)]
*  it is very clear that there is nothing public [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=171.28s)]
*  about National Public Radio. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=173.68s)]
*  NPR is the radio station of permanent Washington. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  That's who pays for it, that's who benefits from it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=178.68s)]
*  By adding three simple words to NPR's tweets, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=181.32s)]
*  Elon Musk exposed that forever to the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=184.28s)]
*  Such is the power of truth. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=187.48s)]
*  It exposes, and of course, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=190.1s)]
*  it infuriates those who are exposed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=192.32s)]
*  So NPR howled in outrage, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=194.86s)]
*  but with its signature pursed-lipped fussiness. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  Here's a direct quote from a piece on NPR's website, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  which really does belong in the Museum of Uptight Liberalism. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=203.24s)]
*  Quote, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  NPR officials have asked Twitter to remove the label. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=207.68s)]
*  They initially assumed it was applied by mistake, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  NPR spokesperson, Isabel Lara said. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=213.56s)]
*  We were not warned. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=216.52s)]
*  It happened quite suddenly last night, Lara said. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  In response to an NPR email for the story seeking comment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=220.84s)]
*  and requesting details about what in particular [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  might have led to the new designation, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=226.44s)]
*  Twitter's press account auto-replied with a poop emoji. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's just so perfect you couldn't improve it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=234.24s)]
*  Hey, Twitter, stop calling us what we are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=236.84s)]
*  Okay, NPR, here's a scat cartoon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=239.56s)]
*  So you can forget the rockets and the electric cars. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk is a hero for this alone. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=245.56s)]
*  But NPR wasn't finished. It still had fight. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  National Public Radio was so angry, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=252.88s)]
*  so enraged to be called state media, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  that its supporters enlisted the help [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=258.0s)]
*  of the regime's top spokeswoman to claim otherwise. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=259.68s)]
*  Stop calling it propaganda, said the propagandist. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=262.76s)]
*  Again, it's an irony-free zone and just too great. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=269.8s)]
*  There's no doubt of the independence of NPR's journalists. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=271.96s)]
*  And it has been, if you've ever been on the receiving end [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  of their questions, you know this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=279.64s)]
*  You know that they have their independence in journalism. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=282.24s)]
*  NPR journalists work digitally [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=285.08s)]
*  to hold public officials accountable [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=287.32s)]
*  and inform the American people. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=289.28s)]
*  The hard-hitting independence nature [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=291.12s)]
*  of their coverage speaks for itself. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=293.72s)]
*  And so I'll leave it there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=296.04s)]
*  That is so Baghdad Bob. It's unbelievable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=298.96s)]
*  Here she is reading a press release for NPR [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=303.8s)]
*  that tells us they're famous for hard-hitting independence, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=306.8s)]
*  which speaks for itself. Really? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  How many tough questions have they asked you, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=313.12s)]
*  Karina Jean-Pierre? Not a single one. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=315.16s)]
*  They're fluffing her every day. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=319.52s)]
*  She's so smart. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=320.8s)]
*  And so she pays them back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  Hard-hitting independence. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=324.04s)]
*  This is the same radio station [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  that in the final days of the last presidential campaign [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  took a look at the biggest political story in years, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=330.2s)]
*  the New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=333.24s)]
*  and then ignored it completely. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=336.2s)]
*  And not only ignored it completely, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  but because they are fussy and self-righteous [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  to their very core, they bragged about how [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=342.0s)]
*  they were ignoring it completely. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=344.88s)]
*  We don't want to waste our time on stories [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=346.52s)]
*  that are not really stories, said NPR's managing editor, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=348.44s)]
*  Terrence Samuel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=351.6s)]
*  And we don't want to waste listeners' and readers' time [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=353.32s)]
*  on stories that are just pure distractions. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=355.84s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=358.48s)]
*  Two weeks before our presidential campaign, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=361.08s)]
*  we find out that the Democratic candidate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=363.64s)]
*  has been taking money from a foreign adversary, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=365.32s)]
*  but that's just a distraction. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=368.44s)]
*  So whatever happened to Terrence Samuel? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=371.48s)]
*  What did he get in return for helping Joe Biden [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=372.88s)]
*  become president at the state-affiliated media network [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=375.16s)]
*  he serves? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=379.6s)]
*  Well, Terrence Samuel has since been promoted [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=380.8s)]
*  to NPR's executive editor, but he still has time to spare [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=382.4s)]
*  because it's not that hard [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=386.24s)]
*  to put morning sedition on the air. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=387.68s)]
*  So you know what he does in his spare time? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=389.0s)]
*  Terrence Samuel hosts seminars on, we're quoting, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=390.68s)]
*  disinformation and democracy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=393.56s)]
*  at something called American University. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=395.76s)]
*  And no, we're not making any of this up. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=398.96s)]
*  Nor are we fabricating NPR's report from just last month [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=401.16s)]
*  that informed us, male athletes have no inherent [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=404.68s)]
*  performance advantages over female athletes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=407.92s)]
*  None at all. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=411.04s)]
*  That is a fact, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=412.04s)]
*  Men and women are physically the same size. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=414.72s)]
*  They have the same muscle mass. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=416.92s)]
*  There is no difference whatsoever in their bone structure. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=418.52s)]
*  We checked with experts. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=421.6s)]
*  So, as you know, NPR is famous [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=424.24s)]
*  for its widely respected science coverage. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=427.2s)]
*  But that's not the only reason that NPR [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=429.52s)]
*  is now the go-to news source [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=431.8s)]
*  for unhappy female attorneys over 50. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=433.44s)]
*  No, there's more to it than that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  They're the lifestyle pieces, the features, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=437.64s)]
*  as they used to say in the newspaper business. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=439.36s)]
*  Here's a piece, for example, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=441.48s)]
*  on how one African-American Barbie doll ahead of its time [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=443.0s)]
*  in the toy industry changed the life [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=447.12s)]
*  of a Latinx girl forever. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=449.24s)]
*  I remember this one Christmas, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  my cousin's father gifted us all Barbies [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=456.36s)]
*  and when everyone was unwrapping, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=461.56s)]
*  you know, the excitement, the paper, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  and I opened up the Barbie and my Barbie was black, you know? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=467.56s)]
*  And everyone kind of like looked at my Barbie [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  and I looked at their Barbies [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  and I could kind of like identify to their Barbies too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=478.32s)]
*  And I wasn't this kind of like as melanated as this Barbie. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=482.72s)]
*  And I was like, oh my gosh, I am different. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=486.2s)]
*  Unhappy middle-aged ladies talking about themselves. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=489.0s)]
*  The narcissism piped directly into your Audi. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=494.72s)]
*  That's NPR. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=499.0s)]
*  You got to say they know their audience. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=500.24s)]
*  They don't only serve their audience, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=502.28s)]
*  they put their audience on the air. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=503.5s)]
*  So it's kind of a continuous loop, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=505.38s)]
*  the snake eating its own tail. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=507.88s)]
*  So you probably shouldn't be too surprised [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=510.34s)]
*  that with an audience like it's desperately unhappy, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=513.36s)]
*  barren personal life audience, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=516.68s)]
*  the NPR is all in on the question of romance novels. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=518.96s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm like really big in the sci-fi ones. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=524.32s)]
*  One of the books was a gay couple [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=526.44s)]
*  and one of them was a Kraken. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=527.48s)]
*  And I didn't want that to unlock something in me. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=529.44s)]
*  Unfortunately it did. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=533.24s)]
*  Before I knew it was happening, Cyrus was carrying me. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=535.48s)]
*  The muscular lengths of his tentacles [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=539.08s)]
*  supporting our combined weight [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  and shuffling us towards the store [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=543.04s)]
*  without breaking our kiss. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=544.6s)]
*  I knew he was strong, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=546.28s)]
*  but I didn't think he was that strong. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=547.16s)]
*  You like that, Rollins? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  He asked. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=550.56s)]
*  As his tentacles slammed the door to the shower stall open [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=551.8s)]
*  and we stumbled inside. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=555.0s)]
*  Well, so it's tentacle porn. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I mean, technically it is tentacle porn, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=559.8s)]
*  which is his own sub-genre [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  and we're not gonna pollute your mind [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=563.68s)]
*  by telling you any more about it than that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=565.28s)]
*  But what it really is, is narcissism. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=567.38s)]
*  Cause here you have an upper income Oberlin graduate [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=570.12s)]
*  talking about, what would he be talking about? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  Well himself, of course, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=575.16s)]
*  cause that's what NPR listeners want to hear about [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=576.48s)]
*  themselves. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=579.36s)]
*  And that's the real journalism, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=580.52s)]
*  the hard hitting independent journalism. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=582.0s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre was touting [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=583.48s)]
*  from the White House briefing room. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=586.08s)]
*  And NPR didn't just start doing it [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=587.64s)]
*  after they got Joe Biden elected, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  they've been doing it for generations. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=590.84s)]
*  Their health coverage in particular stands out. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=593.44s)]
*  Any news organization can run a piece [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=596.4s)]
*  on how to be more healthy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=599.32s)]
*  But only NPR dared to affirm the snack habits [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=601.22s)]
*  of its listeners by telling you, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=605.32s)]
*  yeah, go ahead and be fat. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  Here's a anti-diet dietician. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=609.12s)]
*  So diet culture is this overarching system [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=613.08s)]
*  of beliefs and values. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=615.48s)]
*  It's really endemic to Western culture [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=616.7600000000001s)]
*  at this point in history. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=618.74s)]
*  Kristi Harrison is an anti-diet registered dietician [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=620.72s)]
*  with a master's in public health. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  We've been trying to get Kristi Harrison, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=627.88s)]
*  the anti-diet dietician on our show for years now, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=630.0s)]
*  but we're not NPR, so no luck so far. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=633.26s)]
*  But if you're looking for coverage of LGBTQIAZ plus issues, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=636.98s)]
*  well, you've come to the right place. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=643.42s)]
*  Because it's not just the conventional stuff, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=645.9s)]
*  gay marriage or trans issues, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=647.86s)]
*  they've taken it to another level [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=649.46s)]
*  as befits a cutting edge totally independent news channel [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=652.54s)]
*  like National Public Radio. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=655.5s)]
*  Here they are reporting on trans dinosaur experts. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=656.58s)]
*  Many people who are queer, whether they are trans [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=661.66s)]
*  or some other form of gender queer or whatever it is, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=664.26s)]
*  we love dinosaurs. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=667.38s)]
*  Along with being a dinosaur expert, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  Riley is herself transgender. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=670.9s)]
*  And according to Riley, there is a whole community [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=673.66s)]
*  of gender queer dinosaur enthusiasts online. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=676.3s)]
*  We had no idea, so we checked it out. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=680.06s)]
*  Sure enough, they're there. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=682.78s)]
*  We found dozens of paleo artists online [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=684.9s)]
*  that identify as queer. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=687.78s)]
*  Type dinosaur into the LGBT subreddit, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=689.86s)]
*  hundreds of results with pride dinos, rainbow dinos, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=693.26s)]
*  dino moms, dino dads, and a lot of puns. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=696.86s)]
*  Like Allysaurus. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=700.62s)]
*  Transceratops. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=702.74s)]
*  Transceratops. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=707.06s)]
*  Transesaurus Rex. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=709.2199999999999s)]
*  Now, a lot of people say if the topic of NPR [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=711.3s)]
*  comes up in conversation, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=714.02s)]
*  yeah, I'm all for National Public Radio [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=715.02s)]
*  and I'm happy to work an extra day a year to pay for it, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=716.74s)]
*  but I'm not a trans dinosaur. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=720.5s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=722.7s)]
*  So what's in it for me as a non-trans dinosaur, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=723.7800000000001s)]
*  that seems a little niche. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=726.1s)]
*  And that's a common misperception [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=727.98s)]
*  about National Public Radio. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=729.82s)]
*  As long as you're talking about yourself [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=731.5400000000001s)]
*  and doing so in a self-satisfied, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=733.46s)]
*  completely out of touch way, NPR's the station for you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=735.34s)]
*  In other words, they're interested [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=738.58s)]
*  in all forms of diversity. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=739.5s)]
*  Back in 2021, NPR discovered a trendy new television show. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  Why'd they like it? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=745.74s)]
*  Well, here's why. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=746.74s)]
*  Well, Kamari, what TV show were you binging this year? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=748.58s)]
*  I was watching We Are Lady Parts. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=752.94s)]
*  It's a musical comedy about a punk band in London [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=755.34s)]
*  that is made up of all Muslim women. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=758.7s)]
*  What are you watching? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=763.1400000000001s)]
*  That's the hard-hitting news coverage [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=764.9000000000001s)]
*  that makes the difference between democracy and tyranny. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=766.82s)]
*  What are you watching? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=769.74s)]
*  Self-satisfied, fuzzy people with nose piercings [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=771.26s)]
*  talking about what they're watching [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=773.98s)]
*  in their tiny little apartments in Brooklyn. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=775.34s)]
*  I'm watching a musical, an all Muslim trans musical, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=778.58s)]
*  a punk band. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=782.02s)]
*  It's great. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=783.82s)]
*  So that's NPR in 2023. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=786.14s)]
*  And the truth is, NPR's always been kind of awful, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=788.4200000000001s)]
*  kind of unbearable, kind of cringy, as they say. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=790.86s)]
*  But now, you can't even listen to it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=794.46s)]
*  because the people who work there are deranged. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=798.54s)]
*  They're ideologues. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=801.06s)]
*  And ideologues, of course, in the end, go crazy [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=802.18s)]
*  and start attacking each other. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=806.6999999999999s)]
*  The revolution inevitably eats its own. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=808.3s)]
*  And we're seeing that on display now [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=810.6999999999999s)]
*  and frankly kind of enjoying it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=812.0999999999999s)]
*  So after NPR laid off 10% of its staff recently, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  one NPR show called Louder Than a Riot, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=817.18s)]
*  Louder Than a Riot, they love riots in NPR, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=821.66s)]
*  tweeted this and we're quoting, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=826.42s)]
*  the hardest part is that our SZN, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  SZN, if you're not Hungarian, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=832.1s)]
*  you probably know what that means. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=834.14s)]
*  We certainly don't. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=835.02s)]
*  Our SZN is about Ms. Genoir queer trans black women face [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=836.06s)]
*  in hip hop. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=841.66s)]
*  Yet within NPR, the majority impacted in these layoffs [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=842.9s)]
*  were queer POC staff and programs. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=846.26s)]
*  In other words, racist. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=850.42s)]
*  By the way, Ms. Genoir, in case you aren't up [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=853.38s)]
*  on your NPR speak, has something to do with bigotry [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=855.86s)]
*  against women who are black. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=858.14s)]
*  Not that NPR bothers to define any of those terms. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=860.06s)]
*  Anyway, it gets better because once you put crazy people [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=863.54s)]
*  in charge of your newsroom, well, crazy things happen. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=867.54s)]
*  So they tried to call an all hands meeting [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=870.9s)]
*  to explain why people were being fired. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  Real reason of course is no one wants to listen to this crap. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=875.58s)]
*  But an NPR executive had to get out there [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=878.26s)]
*  and try to speak slowly and tell these people [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=880.26s)]
*  why they were fired and people start screaming at him. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=882.58s)]
*  So he called for civility and then one employee said, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=885.74s)]
*  you need to read this piece, quote, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=891.1800000000001s)]
*  when civility is used as a cudgel against people of color. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=892.82s)]
*  That's NPR, ladies and gentlemen, on the inside. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=900.7s)]
*  NPR, by the way, we told you at the outset [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=903.38s)]
*  is now officially state media. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=904.86s)]
*  And honestly, that tells you a lot about the state. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=906.9s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgLJfn96J0&t=909.94s)]
