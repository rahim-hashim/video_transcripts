# DeSantis reacts to Biden secretly forcing illegals into Florida
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o)
*  So the Biden administration loses control completely. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=0.0s)]
*  They get apoplectic and start hyperventilating. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=2.68s)]
*  If you suggest that really the point of their immigration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=5.8s)]
*  policy is domestic politics, maybe kind of reshuffle [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=7.84s)]
*  the population a little bit so they win. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=10.72s)]
*  They're not doing that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=13.16s)]
*  Now we learn actually the Biden administration [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  is secretly resettling foreign nationals illegal immigrants [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=16.6s)]
*  all over the country with resettlement flights. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=20.76s)]
*  Most of them secret. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=24.84s)]
*  Now, almost 80 of these flights recently have landed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=26.28s)]
*  in the state of Florida. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=28.56s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=30.16s)]
*  Well, here's one thing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=31.0s)]
*  An illegal migrant from Honduras called Medina Uloa [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=31.84s)]
*  was on one of those flights. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=34.8s)]
*  He is now accused of murdering a father of four [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=35.88s)]
*  in his own home. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=38.32s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is the sitting governor of Florida. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=40.12s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=42.36s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=43.32s)]
*  So just to, the news stories suggest [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=45.2s)]
*  that the administration was sending planes into your state [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=48.2s)]
*  and offloading people secretly from foreign countries [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=51.92s)]
*  in violation of the law. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=54.72s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=55.72s)]
*  So these are flights that are coming in two [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=57.88s)]
*  or three in the morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  The feds of course control the airspace [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  and they're there on the ground. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=63.88s)]
*  They take these folks and then they send them [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=65.56s)]
*  in other parts of Florida by bus [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=67.68s)]
*  or other parts of the Southeast. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=69.44s)]
*  And that individual who was murdered was in fact murdered [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=71.4s)]
*  by an illegal alien who was on one of Biden's flights. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=75.48s)]
*  These midnight flights, unannounced, no notice, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=79.0s)]
*  no support for the state, no ability for us to veto it [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=83.16s)]
*  ahead of time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  And if Biden had not been doing that, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=87.8s)]
*  if he'd been doing his job, that individual would be alive [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=92.16s)]
*  I'm not a constitutional scholar. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  I know that you are an attorney, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=95.72s)]
*  but are they allowed to do this? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Can the White House just decide, we don't like you, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  you may run for president, we don't like that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  And so we're just gonna flood your state [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=103.44s)]
*  with people from other countries [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=104.72s)]
*  and there's nothing you can do about it? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=105.72s)]
*  So we're looking at what we can do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=108.32s)]
*  I think that they use these private contractors. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=110.6s)]
*  So what we're looking at is how can we fight back [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=113.56s)]
*  against the contractors? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=115.68s)]
*  We can obviously deny them state contracts, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=117.12s)]
*  which we will do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=119.48s)]
*  Can we deny them access to Florida's market generally? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=121.04s)]
*  Can we tax them? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=123.84s)]
*  Can we do things to provide disincentives [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  so they can't do it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna do whatever we can to do it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=128.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, they do have the ability [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=130.68s)]
*  to get into these airports because the FAA controls it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=133.84s)]
*  and the feds really have jurisdiction over it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=137.0s)]
*  So we're trying to work with the local airport authorities [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=139.12s)]
*  to see if there's a way that we can get around that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  But we are going to go after some of these contractors [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=143.64s)]
*  because they are bringing in people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=147.32s)]
*  that are causing burdens on us. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=149.32s)]
*  And as we've seen tragically, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  cause someone to lose their life. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  I bet you'll figure out a way. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  Governor Hernandez-Santos of the state of Florida, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=156.6s)]
*  appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=157.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=160.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNj7RIN00o&t=173.64s)]
