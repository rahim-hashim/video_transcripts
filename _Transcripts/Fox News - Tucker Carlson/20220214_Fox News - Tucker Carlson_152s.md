# I was ‘barred’ from publishing anything on Fauci: Former Forbes contributor
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g)
*  Adam, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=0.0s)]
*  It's, I'm not in any way doubting your story, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=1.84s)]
*  but it's, I mean, I used to work in magazines. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=4.32s)]
*  I've never heard of anything like that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=6.24s)]
*  Did I misstate what happened? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=8.32s)]
*  Well, no, you were spot on, Tucker. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Clearly, Forbes editors did not want our oversight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=13.36s)]
*  of Dr. Anthony Fauci's finances on the website. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=16.16s)]
*  And so after eight years, 206 columns, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=19.76s)]
*  I estimate I wrote a quarter million words [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=22.56s)]
*  on investigations on the Forbes platform. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=24.96s)]
*  My column was canceled. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=27.6s)]
*  So here's how it worked. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=29.12s)]
*  The National Institutes of Health, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=31.12s)]
*  top six top executives wrote an email to myself and Randall Lane, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=32.96s)]
*  the top content officer at Forbes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=37.84s)]
*  It was couched as a corrections email, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=40.32s)]
*  but the corrections, there was basically no substantial corrections, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=42.8s)]
*  and they quibbled about small things in my column. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=46.64s)]
*  But that was the excuse that Forbes used to cancel the column. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  And it was this Randall Lane character, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  who's like posing as an editor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=56.56s)]
*  He's the one who made this decision. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=58.16s)]
*  So here's how it went. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  After that email, within 24 hours, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=63.04s)]
*  I received a phone call from my editor at Forbes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=65.36s)]
*  that I was barred from publishing on Anthony Fauci any longer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=68.16s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, our oversight was tip of the spear with Anthony Fauci. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=71.92s)]
*  A year ago, we were the ones that published [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=75.44s)]
*  that he was the most highly compensated federal employee. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=77.36s)]
*  That column has 900,000 views. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=80.64s)]
*  We published the fact that his household net worth rivaled $11 million, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=83.12s)]
*  and in 2020, his household earnings, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=87.68s)]
*  Anthony Fauci and his wife made $1.7 million. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=92.48s)]
*  Many people don't know that Anthony Fauci's wife, Christine Grady, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=97.2s)]
*  is the chief bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=101.12s)]
*  She makes more than the vice president, north of $235,000. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  Anthony Fauci makes more than the president, at $456,000. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  So if you take their salaries, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=114.72s)]
*  tack on the taxpayer-paid cost of federal benefits at 30%. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=116.16s)]
*  The two Fauci's, their household income paid for by taxpayers, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=120.64s)]
*  every year is $900,000. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=124.56s)]
*  You just described the whole point of journalism, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=129.04s)]
*  is to tell people what their government, which they pay for, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=130.96s)]
*  which claims to represent them, is actually doing, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=133.6s)]
*  and Randall Lane, the kid in the hat, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=136.56s)]
*  and the rest of the butt kissers at Forbes shutting you down. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=139.36s)]
*  I think it's a shocking story, I really do, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  at a time with a lot of shocking stories. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=147.28s)]
*  Adam Angiewski, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCwI-PuCY2g&t=148.56s)]
