# Tucker Carlson: Biden is done
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. If you're a normal person, it's a pretty weird [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=0.0s)]
*  experience watching Joe Biden's presidency get euthanized by his own party. On one hand, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=5.04s)]
*  there's an undeniable thrill to it. You have to admit that Biden is the most destructive [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=10.88s)]
*  president in American history. More things have broken under his watch than enter under any other [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=15.36s)]
*  president. Joe Biden deserves to be driven from office and disgraced. But for this, breaking [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=21.12s)]
*  federal classification rules, some of the stupidest and most dishonest laws Congress has ever passed, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=27.6s)]
*  it's like arresting El Chapo for expired plates. It's missing the point. But it looks like that's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=33.52s)]
*  what's going to happen. It seems like every day when a Biden's lawyer shows up with more [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=38.96s)]
*  sheaves of classified documents, like a dog who's found another dead chipmunk under the house, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  this bunch was in his office at Penn, the one paid for by the Communist Party of China. These were [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=47.84s)]
*  found next to his sad little midlife crisis sports car in a garage in Delaware, and so on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  You keep waiting for the White House physician to announce another document trove has been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=58.8s)]
*  discovered after a routine colonoscopy. It could happen because at this point you know exactly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=62.32s)]
*  where this story is heading. Permanent Washington does not want Joe Biden to run for president [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=68.32s)]
*  again. This is how they're sending that message. Even CNN has decided to become interested in Joe [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=73.6s)]
*  Biden's misdeeds two years into his presidency. They're doing segments on how classification [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=79.28s)]
*  laws protect this country from its mortal enemies like Russia. So you know for certain the order has [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=84.64s)]
*  gone out. Biden is done. What a missed opportunity this is. If you're looking for crimes that Joe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Biden has committed, there is a very long list. Our country is being invaded. The world is on the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=97.44s)]
*  brink of nuclear war. American cities have become slums. Our economy is in shambles. Even our airplanes [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  no longer take off on time. It's a disaster and Joe Biden and his staff have a hand in all of it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=108.96s)]
*  In a country with a functioning government, Joe Biden would have been impeached before the first [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=116.16s)]
*  million illegal aliens crossed over our southern border, but no one did anything to stop it. So now [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  they're arriving at the rate of a quarter million a month. Watch. Customs and border protection [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  sources exclusively tell Fox News more than 250,000 migrants were encountered at the border in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=130.64s)]
*  month of December, about as many people living in Scottsdale, Arizona, making it the highest [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=137.44s)]
*  month ever on record. In Eagle Pass, Texas, the migrant surge continues. Local Kenny County rancher [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=143.28s)]
*  Pam Schott had a harrowing experience with migrants on her property. And I looked out the back and I [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=149.92s)]
*  could see three illegals walking up to the house. I had gotten a gun, which is an AR-15. I asked him, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=155.52s)]
*  I said, please, you know, stop, go away. And I had the gun in my hands and they, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=162.8s)]
*  just kind of looked at me and kind of smiled. And I was like, auto and just go away. And they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  refused to do so. They're on the other side of the glass, trying to get in and not backing down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Not backing down. Even though I have a high powerful rifle in my arms, they are not backing down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  That was scary. A rifle Joe Biden would like to take away from her. So that, writ large, is the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=190.96s)]
*  biggest story of our lifetimes. It is the one thing Joe Biden has done that cannot be undone. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  Our great grandchildren are going to live with the consequences of this, but you never know it from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=205.28s)]
*  watching most of the news. There's an effective media blackout on Joe Biden's immigration policies [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  and on their downstream effects on America. There are too many strangers pouring in at once. And as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=214.16s)]
*  a result, the country is becoming chaotic. Here's a rare television news piece on what happened when [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=220.24s)]
*  officials in New York decided to house some of Joe Biden's illegal aliens in a local hotel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=225.12s)]
*  An employee there says that migrants have made an absolute mess of the place. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=230.72s)]
*  You're standing in front of it. Is that true? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Well, what we're hearing from that employee is that the hotel is completely overrun. He says, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=239.28s)]
*  you know, of course, some people just looking for that better life, but as a result, the hotel is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=244.0s)]
*  a mess and he fears for his safety. We don't have any guests anymore. They sold the entire hotel [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=249.2s)]
*  from the fourth floor to the 28th floor. It's all migrants. So we got people who are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  getting drunk using marijuana. They are punching and beating their wives or their girlfriends. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=266.48s)]
*  Wow. We have teenagers running around wild around the hotel, opening the fire exit doors and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=274.08s)]
*  doing what teenagers do in the stairways. And it's a mess. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=284.16s)]
*  It's a mess, he said. Of course it is. The whole country is a mess because Joe Biden has ignored [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=289.04s)]
*  immigration laws passed by the Congress. That is a crime and it has killed huge numbers of Americans, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=294.96s)]
*  hundreds of thousands dead from narcotics. Fentanyl has changed the entire game here in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=302.96s)]
*  San Francisco. You can't buy heroin out here anymore. Nobody sells heroin and nobody uses [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=308.32s)]
*  heroin. Everybody has transitioned over to fentanyl. Fentanyl is the most dangerous drug [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  to ever hit the streets in the United States in history. Fentanyl has killed more than 70,000 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=317.2s)]
*  Americans in 12 months. Here in San Francisco, it's the dominant drug. It's responsible for [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=321.76s)]
*  three quarters of drug overdoses, brazen drug dealing and rampant drug use. In the shadow of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=327.44s)]
*  City Hall, the same City Hall residents say actively enabled the fentanyl crisis. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=332.96s)]
*  All of it, every gram came over an open border. So what's notable as a political matter is that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=339.04s)]
*  every one of these disasters, the fentanyl epidemic, the chaos and crime in our cities, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=345.36s)]
*  the invasion underway through Texas, Arizona and California, all of those deeply concern Americans. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=349.12s)]
*  We're not guessing at that. Polls show it very clearly. By contrast, how many voters do you think [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=354.96s)]
*  are lying awake right now worrying that public officials might violate some obscure federal [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=360.32s)]
*  classification law? None. Not a single person. No one outside Washington cares or even understands [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  the issue. And yet it is classified documents, not our open borders, that the Justice Department [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=371.44s)]
*  is punishing Joe Biden for. Why is that? What's going on here? Well, it's simple. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=377.28s)]
*  Washington is protecting itself. Joe Biden alone is responsible for this crime. He alone [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=382.24s)]
*  took home classified documents. He didn't have help in doing that. But allowing the country to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=388.56s)]
*  be invaded, that's not something you can do by yourself. So if Biden were to be taken down for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  opening the southern border, a lot of other people would go with them. He had a lot of accomplices. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=399.44s)]
*  Permanent Washington doesn't want that. And ultimately, and here's the point, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=404.56s)]
*  permanent Washington is in charge. It's not the democracy you imagine. We're seeing that now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=408.08s)]
*  So if you want to understand, if you really want to understand how the American government [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=413.84s)]
*  actually works at the highest levels, and if you want to know why they don't teach history anymore, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  one thing you should know is that the most popular president in American history was [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon. Yet somehow, without a single vote being cast by a single [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=427.2s)]
*  American voter, Richard Nixon was kicked out of office and replaced by the only unelected [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=433.44s)]
*  president in American history. So he went from the most popular president to a president nobody [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=438.24s)]
*  voted for. Wait a minute, you may ask. Why didn't I know that? Wasn't Richard Nixon a criminal? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=443.84s)]
*  Wasn't he despised by all decent people? No, he wasn't. In fact, if any president could claim [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=450.4s)]
*  to be the people's choice, it was Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon was reelected in 1972 by the largest [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=457.44s)]
*  margin of the popular vote ever recorded before or since. Nixon got 17 million more votes than his [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=463.04s)]
*  opponent. Less than two years later, he was gone. He was forced to resign, and in his place, an [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=470.16s)]
*  obedient servant of the federal agencies called Gerald Ford took over the White House. How did [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  that happen? Well, it's a long story, but here are the highlights, and they tell you a lot. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  Richard Nixon believed that elements in the federal bureaucracy were working to undermine [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  the American system of government and had been doing that for a long time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=488.8s)]
*  He often said that. He was absolutely right. On June 23, 1972, Nixon met with the then CIA director, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=493.04s)]
*  Richard Helms, at the White House. During the conversation, which thankfully was tape recorded, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=500.16s)]
*  Nixon suggested he knew, quote, who shot John, meaning President John F. Kennedy. Nixon further [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  implied that the CIA was directly involved in Kennedy's assassination, which we now know it was. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=512.08s)]
*  Helms's telling response? Total silence. But for Nixon, it didn't matter because it was already [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=518.32s)]
*  over. Four days before, on June 19, the Washington Post had published the first of many stories about [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=524.6400000000001s)]
*  a break-in at the Watergate office building. Unbeknownst to Nixon and unreported by the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  Washington Post, four of the five burglars worked for the CIA. The first of many dishonest Watergate [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=535.6s)]
*  stories was written by a 29-year-old Metro reporter called Bob Woodward. Who exactly was Bob Woodward? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=542.4s)]
*  Well, he wasn't a journalist. Bob Woodward had no background whatsoever in the news business. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=549.6s)]
*  Instead, Bob Woodward came directly from the classified areas of the federal government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=555.04s)]
*  Shortly before Watergate, Woodward was a naval officer at the Pentagon. He had a top-secret [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  clearance. He worked regularly with the intel agencies. At times, Woodward was even detailed [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=564.24s)]
*  to the Nixon White House, where he interacted with Richard Nixon's top aides. Soon after leaving the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=569.28s)]
*  Navy for reasons that have never been clear, Woodward was hired by the most powerful news [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  outlet in Washington and assigned the biggest story in the country. And just to make it crystal [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=579.76s)]
*  clear what was actually happening, Woodward's main source for his Watergate series was the deputy [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=584.9599999999999s)]

*  COINTELPRO program, which was designed to secretly discredit political actors the federal agencies [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=596.56s)]
*  wanted to destroy. People like Richard Nixon. And at the same time, those same agencies were also [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  working to take down Nixon's elected vice president, Spiro Agnew. In the fall of 1973, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=608.64s)]
*  Agnew was indicted for tax evasion and forced to resign. His replacement was a colorless congressman [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=614.0s)]
*  from Grand Rapids called Gerald Ford. What was Ford's qualification for the job? Well, he had [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  served on the Warren Commission, which absolved the CIA of responsibility for President Kennedy's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=626.16s)]
*  murder. Nixon was strong-armed into accepting Gerald Ford by Democrats in Congress. Quote, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  we gave Nixon no choice but Ford, Speaker of the House Carl Albert later boasted. Eight months later, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=637.12s)]
*  Gerald Ford of the Warren Commission was the President of the United States. See how that works? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  So those are the facts, not speculation. All of that actually happened. None of it's secret. Most [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=649.76s)]
*  of it actually is on Wikipedia. But no mainstream news organization has ever told that story. It's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=654.32s)]
*  so obvious, yet it's intentionally ignored. And as a result, permanent Washington remains in charge [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  of our political system. Unelected lifers and the federal agencies make the biggest decisions in [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=668.32s)]
*  American government and crush anyone who tries to rein them in. And in the process, our democracy [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=673.7600000000001s)]
*  becomes a joke. Now, you may have noticed that the very first person in the Trump administration [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=679.6s)]
*  the agencies went after was General Michael Flynn. Why Flynn? Because Mike Flynn was a career army [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=685.76s)]
*  intel officer who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency. In other words, Mike Flynn knew exactly [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=693.28s)]
*  how the system worked. And as a result, he was capable of fighting back. Four days after Donald [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=698.96s)]
*  Trump's inauguration, the FBI lured Mike Flynn into a meeting without his lawyer, concocted a [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=705.12s)]
*  series of fake crimes, and forced him to resign. So that's how things actually work in Washington. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=710.32s)]
*  Let's stop lying about it. Joe Biden, meanwhile, whooped like a hyena when the Justice Department [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=718.32s)]
*  destroyed Mike Flynn. So there is, we have to say, a certain perverse justice in watching something [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=723.12s)]
*  very similar happen to Joe Biden himself six years later. Joe Biden does not deserve our sympathy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=728.0s)]
*  He's being shafted, but don't weep for him. And yet the rest of us do deserve a better system, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=735.2s)]
*  an actual democracy. When people nobody voted for run everything, you are not living in a free country. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXq8S02NJc&t=741.84s)]
