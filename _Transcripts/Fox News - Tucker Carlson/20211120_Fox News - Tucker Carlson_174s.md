# Whitlock: ‘This was a calculated strategy to disarm America’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4)
*  And for the record, by the way, this show had the same position on Kyle Rittenhouse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=0.0s)]
*  if he was a Bernie Sanders voter. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=4.16s)]
*  Which we don't know if he is. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=6.0s)]
*  He probably doesn't vote for anybody. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=7.4s)]
*  He's too young. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=8.68s)]
*  But the point is, this is not partisan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=9.68s)]
*  The right to self-defense is the most basic right any human being has. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=11.8s)]
*  You're born with it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=16.5s)]
*  It's innate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=17.76s)]
*  And if they try and take that away, we're all in trouble. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=18.76s)]
*  So as we said at the end of the last block, we wanted to talk to Jason Whitlock, and whenever [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=22.56s)]
*  we do, we never even ask a question. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  We just throw it to him, and he always surprises us in a good way. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=29.42s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=33.34s)]
*  He's of course the host of Fearless. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=34.34s)]
*  Jason Whitlock, great to see you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=35.34s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=36.34s)]
*  Tucker, I think that what we've just seen from those 12 jurors is courage that we needed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=38.06s)]
*  It's inspirational to all of us as men and women. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=46.06s)]
*  It took real courage for them to do this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=50.88s)]
*  I just want to try to add this take, if I could say one thing while I'm here, because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=53.62s)]
*  you've been having this conversation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=58.42s)]
*  Why is everything being couched as race? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  This is a calculated strategy to disarm America, to go after the guns, and to eventually rewrite [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=63.78s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=71.62s)]
*  They're trying to define America as a failure, and its number one failure is along the lines [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=73.58s)]
*  of race. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=81.1s)]
*  And if they can convince enough of the American public that this country is irredeemably racist, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=82.42s)]
*  they now have a justification to rewrite the Constitution, start this thing all over, and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  make us more like China. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=95.66s)]
*  That's the end game. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=98.18s)]
*  This is not an accident that from Joe Biden on down, who says that white supremacy is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=99.62s)]
*  the biggest threat to America, all the way down to racial mad-al, aka Joy Reid, constantly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  talking race, race, race, race, race. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=111.86s)]
*  This is a strategy that's been quite effective. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=114.7s)]
*  It hides the agenda. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=118.2s)]
*  They've convinced black people that Planned Parenthood and aborting your babies is the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=120.42s)]
*  greatest thing you can do, and anybody that tells you different is a racist. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=124.78s)]
*  When we know that Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger, they're the racist, and that the destruction [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=129.38s)]
*  of black babies in the womb, that is the racist activity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=135.04s)]
*  The bigger the lie they tell, it's like the more we believe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=141.54s)]
*  We need to recognize they're lying to us intentionally with a defined goal of rewriting the Constitution [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=144.98s)]
*  and taking guns away and sovereignty away from the American people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=154.32s)]
*  God, that's so smart. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=159.34s)]
*  The bigger the lie, the more likely people are to believe it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  If they're putting abortion clinics in your neighborhood, they don't love you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=165.22s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=168.14s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=169.14s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  Jason Whitlock, really glad to have you on tonight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5PgzjUG1c4&t=173.54s)]
