# Harmeet Dhillon announces run to oust RNC chair Ronna McDaniel
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo)
*  Well, no one would know better than Hermit Dillon herself, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=0.0s)]
*  chairwoman of the Republican National Lawyers Association, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=2.68s)]
*  who joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=4.88s)]
*  Hermit, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=6.4s)]
*  Is it true that you plan to run for RNC chair? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, Tucker, I'm gonna announce tonight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  that actually I am going to run for RNC chair. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=14.52s)]
*  And the reason is that, you know, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=17.62s)]
*  to play off of a famous catchphrase, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=19.64s)]
*  Republicans are tired of losing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=22.72s)]
*  And I think that we really need to radically reshape [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=24.88s)]
*  our leadership in order to win. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=27.46s)]
*  And we can't keep running elections [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=29.28s)]
*  like we did in the 90s and the 2000s. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  And we really have to modernize [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  to compete with the Democrats dollar for dollar [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  in the ways they fundraise, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  the way they deliver their ballots to the ballot boxes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=39.64s)]
*  Our messaging needs to be fresh and positive [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=43.24s)]
*  and not just reactive to news cycles [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=45.56s)]
*  and what the Democrats are doing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=47.52s)]
*  And I think that the party needs to realize [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=49.44s)]
*  that the party has become a populist party. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=51.72s)]
*  The base of the party demands populist messages [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  that speak to them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  And not chamber of commerce messages, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=60.04s)]
*  not neocon messages, not warmonger messages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=62.08s)]
*  And I'm afraid that the base of our party [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=66.16s)]
*  is not getting what it needs from our leadership. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=67.96s)]
*  And so after three successive rounds [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=70.64s)]
*  of really disappointing results, Tucker, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm a member of the RNC [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  and no other member is stepping up to challenge leadership. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=78.08s)]
*  And our current leadership has never been challenged [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=82.24s)]
*  for the chair job. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=84.64s)]
*  And I think that challenge and competition is very good. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  And so I'm hoping to gain the support of grassroots Americans [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  who do not like the direction of the party [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  and its leadership. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=94.6s)]
*  They need to contact the 168 members of the RNC [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=95.86s)]
*  in their states and territories [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  and tell them that they too want change. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  And I think that change is popular among the base. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  I hear from thousands of Americans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=105.13999999999999s)]
*  on a weekly basis about that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=107.0s)]
*  They wanna see us fighting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=108.8s)]
*  Tucker, you know as well as anybody else [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=110.52s)]
*  that I'm a fighter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  And I fight every waking hour of the day. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=113.96s)]
*  And that's what we need right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=117.12s)]
*  And so that's me, I'm offering to take a giant, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  step back from my law firm and my nonprofit to do this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=123.44s)]
*  It's a big sacrifice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  But I think it's important for our country [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  that I love so much as a first generation immigrant. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=130.04s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=133.3s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  I can vouch for your toughness. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=134.96s)]
*  That's absolutely real and much needed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=135.8s)]
*  Godspeed, harmony telling, we're rooting for you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=137.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=138.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=140.32s)]
*  We are changing the world and changing your life [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=147.12s)]
*  from Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qcCPJbA2Oo&t=149.88s)]
