# Trump warns biggest threat is 'nuclear warming'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo)
*  Covering the weather beat here in Weed Deep on Beach, actually we're here to interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=0.0s)]
*  the former president and now the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=8.36s)]
*  While the rest of us have spent the last two and a half years arguing about systemic racism [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=12.16s)]
*  and trans rights and other ephemera, other imaginary things, America's position globally [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  has eroded so fast it defies belief. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=24.32s)]
*  But Donald Trump has noticed things have really changed since he left office and that's the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=28.52s)]
*  topic of this next part of the conversation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=33.44s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=35.64s)]
*  You said at the time when you were president that going to war with Russia, either hot [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=38.36s)]
*  war or cold war, would drive Russia into an alliance with China. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=43.16s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=47.16s)]
*  That would displace us as the most powerful nation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=48.16s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  But we have a bigger problem. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  The bigger problem is the weaponry. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=52.64s)]
*  The weaponry today is so powerful. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=54.16s)]
*  This isn't like second world war where we have army tanks running around shooting each [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=55.82s)]
*  other. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=59.1s)]
*  This is weapons the likes of which the world has never seen before. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=60.1s)]
*  They have them and we have them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=64.3s)]
*  And China has them less, but within five years China will have equal to us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=66.7s)]
*  China, I'm talking about nuclear. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=70.18s)]
*  China has the beginnings of a very big, very powerful nuclear. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=73.02s)]
*  They're short five years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=77.66s)]
*  They had started much later. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=78.82s)]
*  Russia and us are comparable. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=81.78s)]
*  Massive power, massive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=84.74s)]
*  And that's one of the things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=87.1s)]
*  More than people understand? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=88.1s)]
*  More than people understand, yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=89.1s)]
*  Were you surprised? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=90.1s)]
*  They don't understand the power. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=91.1s)]
*  If you look at Hiroshima, Hiroshima, as some people call it, if you look at Nagasaki, you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=93.06s)]
*  look at those two events took place many, many years ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=98.94s)]
*  I multiply that power times 500. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  That's what you're talking about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=107.1s)]
*  Where it actually melted the granite. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=108.1s)]
*  You know, granite is unmeltable by blowtorches. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=109.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=112.46s)]
*  But the granite, if you look at granite areas, it's like water that got, you know, hardened [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  like an ice skating rink. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=120.66s)]
*  It melted the granite. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=122.78s)]
*  If you look at that and multiply it times 500, that's what you're talking about. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=124.82s)]
*  When I listen to people talking about global warming, that the ocean will rise in the next [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  300 years by one-eighth of an inch, and they talk about this is our problem. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Our big problem is nuclear warming. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=142.98s)]
*  Nobody even talks about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=145.22s)]
*  The environmentalists talk about all this nonsense in many cases. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=146.78s)]
*  Look, I'm an environmentalist also, I guess, in my own way, because I've done a good job [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=150.82s)]
*  with the environment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  But nobody talks about nuclear. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  The problem, the problem we have, the biggest problem we have in the whole world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  It's not global warming. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=164.62s)]
*  It's nuclear warming. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=166.38s)]
*  And all it takes is one madman, and you're going to have a problem the likes of which [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=168.12s)]
*  the world has never seen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=172.98s)]
*  And it's only a matter of seconds. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=174.5s)]
*  You don't have to wait two to 300 years for it to happen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  So what you're saying is demonstrably true. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=180.06s)]
*  Why is this not something our leaders talk about or the press talks about? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=185.06s)]
*  Because I don't think they're smart. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=188.46s)]
*  I don't think they get it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=190.1s)]
*  Putin got it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=192.26s)]
*  I would talk to him about it all the time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=193.26s)]
*  I never mentioned the word nuclear. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=194.7s)]
*  You never heard me mention the word. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=196.22s)]
*  You know, my uncle was a professor, a great professor at MIT for a long time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=198.5s)]
*  I think he was the longest Dr. John Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  And he would talk about a lot of different things. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=205.77999999999997s)]
*  And it was very interesting to me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=208.54s)]
*  For years I talked to him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=210.26s)]
*  He passed away as a great, great gentleman. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=211.94s)]
*  I think it's the longest tenured professor in the history of MIT. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  But if he wasn't, he was very close. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=218.5s)]
*  He was there for almost 40 years. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=219.82s)]
*  And we talked about things. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=222.7s)]
*  And he said, you know, someday they'll have a suitcase. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=223.7s)]
*  And in that suitcase, it'll be nuclear. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=229.38s)]
*  And you'll blow up New York City out of a suitcase. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=233.74s)]
*  And I said, no, Uncle John, that can't possibly. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=238.34s)]
*  He's right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=241.14s)]
*  The power is so incredible. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=242.66s)]
*  You can fire up a submarine and run it for years on essentially a tablet. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=244.56s)]
*  Run it for years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=250.78s)]
*  So when we talk about war, and when I watch all of the people talking about Ukraine and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=252.62s)]
*  how's Ukraine doing, blah, blah, blah, Grash is sitting back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=258.98s)]
*  First of all, Ukraine's being obliterated. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=263.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=265.26s)]
*  OK, let's not even talk nuclear. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=266.26s)]
*  But let's say it wasn't. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's say they were doing better than anticipated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  If he decided to use his second form of destruction, which is nuclear, that's the end of that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=274.44s)]
*  You understand? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=282.82s)]
*  And I know where you are in Ukraine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=284.42s)]
*  So I mean, you understand it better than most. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  Most people don't even talk about it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=288.34s)]
*  They don't talk about the fact that he has equal to the United States in nuclear capability [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=290.14s)]
*  and destruction. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=296.26s)]
*  And so I watch all of this happening, and it's so sad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=298.62s)]
*  But can I just ask, the Biden people know the power of nuclear weapons. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  They now control our arsenal. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=305.5s)]
*  They don't seem worried about this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  That's because they don't understand life. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  They don't understand whatever it is that you have to understand. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=312.94s)]
*  You know, it's very interesting. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=315.58s)]
*  At the very beginning, Biden was very afraid of nuclear because I watched him and he said, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=316.92s)]
*  oh, they have nuclear weapons, which was exactly the wrong signal to send. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=320.56s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=324.32s)]
*  But if you go back and check your files, you'll see Biden early on saying, oh, well, we can't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  do this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=330.62s)]
*  They have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=331.62s)]
*  Well, you don't want to act that way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=332.62s)]
*  But he was very afraid of nuclear. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=335.74s)]
*  I said, you know, you've got to be a little bit cooler than that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=337.64s)]
*  But what happened is now that nobody talks about it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=341.64s)]
*  But every day, Putin mentions it, and every day, other people mention it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, if you look, other countries are talking about getting it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=349.11999999999995s)]
*  This was something you don't mention. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  I call it the N-word. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=355.64s)]
*  You have two N-words. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=356.64s)]
*  You don't mention either one of them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  The nuclear word you don't mention because the power is so destructive. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=361.4s)]
*  I met with professors at MIT, and I was preparing for a debate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=365.12s)]
*  I wouldn't say it was a long preparation, but I did want to talk about nuclear because [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  I consider it to be the single greatest threat the world has, far greater than global warming. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Like not even a contest. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  And I had these people come down that were very smart, very expert. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=384.24s)]
*  And I said, so, when we start talking about nuclear in a debate, how would you handle [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=389.74s)]
*  it? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=395.92s)]
*  And they looked at me, one in particular, and said, sir, you can't talk about it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=397.4s)]
*  You cannot talk about it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=405.62s)]
*  I said, what does that mean? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=407.0s)]
*  He said, it is so massive, it is so destructive, that you cannot talk about it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  I understood exactly what he meant. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=415.96s)]
*  And we stayed away from it for the most part. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  But now Putin is mentioning it all the time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=423.36s)]
*  We don't mention it, but Putin is always mentioning it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  You've heard him say it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=429.68s)]
*  We are a nuclear power. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=430.88s)]
*  He said not so long ago, I said, that's the first time I've heard a major country. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=432.0s)]
*  You know, you do hear it talked about, and I did a good job. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=437.88s)]
*  I did a great job with North Korea. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=440.8s)]
*  Kim Jong-un, you went with me on a trip. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=443.32s)]
*  You insulted him, which didn't make my life too easy, but that's okay. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=446.64s)]
*  But you were there, one of the few. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=452.78s)]
*  And it was an amazing — it had to be one of the most incredible experiences for you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=454.9s)]
*  For sure. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=459.7s)]
*  But it was amazing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=460.7s)]
*  We had thousands of reporters. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=461.7s)]
*  They weren't treated particularly nicely either, by the way. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=465.26s)]
*  But I got along great with him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  And because of that, it started rough, remember, with, you know, Rocket Man, little Rocket [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=470.18s)]
*  Man? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=474.34s)]
*  And he said, I have a button on my desk, a red button. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=475.52s)]
*  I said, I have a red button on my desk, too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=478.74s)]
*  Mine's bigger and mine works. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=480.58s)]
*  Yours doesn't. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=481.86s)]
*  And this went on for a couple of months. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=482.86s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the logjam was broken and he wanted to meet. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=484.54s)]
*  And we did meet. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=489.54s)]
*  And we get along great. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=490.54s)]
*  To this day, we get along great. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=491.54s)]
*  He won't talk to Biden. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  He won't even talk to these people. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=495.1s)]
*  He won't even talk to him. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=497.42s)]
*  He has no respect for him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=498.42s)]
*  He's a man. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=499.82s)]
*  He'd like — if he respects you, he respects you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=500.82s)]
*  He wouldn't talk to Obama. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=502.98s)]
*  Obama tried to get meetings with him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=503.98s)]
*  He wouldn't meet with him. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=505.66s)]
*  He met with me. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=506.66s)]
*  I met with him twice. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=507.66s)]
*  I would have had a deal worked out with him. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=508.66s)]
*  He's got tremendous nuclear capability. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=510.82s)]
*  It's the single biggest problem. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=513.74s)]
*  Maybe this shows more important than even I thought it might be, because somebody's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=515.46s)]
*  got to understand what has to happen and they have to de-escalate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=520.1s)]
*  So, how would you do that now? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=523.22s)]
*  Well, now — so, you have a problem. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=525.42s)]
*  You got this crazy world that's blown up and the United States has absolutely no say. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=528.42s)]
*  And Macron, who's a friend of mine, is over with China, kissing his ass, OK, in China. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=533.34s)]
*  I said, France is now going to China. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=540.34s)]
*  You take a look at Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=543.58s)]
*  Look at what happened. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=546.38s)]
*  They're great people. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=547.38s)]
*  They wanted to help us. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=549.74s)]
*  He goes over and gets a fist pump. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=552.02s)]
*  You know what a fist pump means? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=553.58s)]
*  Don't shake my hand, because your hand's dirty. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=554.58s)]
*  That's what a fist pump is. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=556.7s)]
*  They got it — they were so insulted. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=558.62s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=560.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=562.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't want to shake your hand. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  Let's go fist pump. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njsp3NyM7Fo&t=564.1800000000001s)]
