# Libs of TikTok creator recounts trying to confront AOC over being 'defamed' during hearing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU)
*  So one of the saddest and most painful lies they keep telling you is you're imagining it if you think children are being physically mutilated in the name of gender ideology. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=0.0s)]
*  But it's actually real. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=9.28s)]
*  We wish it weren't. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=10.6s)]
*  We wish we were imagining it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=11.44s)]
*  Hospitals brag about these surgeries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=12.6s)]
*  And we know this really because of the founder of a Twitter handle called Libs of TikTok, HiRachik. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  She's reported on it extensively. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=21.52s)]
*  Of course, this has infuriated people who are dedicated to lying like Sandy Cortez. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=24.16s)]
*  You're a liar, she said. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=28.32s)]
*  And she called HiRachik that directly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=31.0s)]
*  So Rachik decided to go pay Sandy Cortez a visit. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=32.84s)]
*  Here's how it went. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=35.96s)]
*  A few weeks ago, AOC lied about me on the house floor. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=38.16s)]
*  Ms. Navarroly, are you familiar with the account Libs of TikTok? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=42.92s)]
*  That account posted false information about Boston Children's Hospital, claiming that they were providing hysterectomies to children. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=46.28s)]
*  So I am right outside the Cannon Building and I'm going to go inside and hopefully meet AOC and ask her why she lied about me and get some answers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=54.68s)]
*  I don't think anyone's here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=65.76s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=67.84s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=68.36s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=69.04s)]
*  Is the congresswoman in? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=70.08s)]
*  No, she's not. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=71.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=72.28s)]
*  Is the person who's in charge of her tech policy in? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=75.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=76.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=77.28s)]
*  So basically she lied about me on the house floor a couple of weeks ago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=77.72s)]
*  So I just wanted to ask her why she lied about me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=81.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=84.16s)]
*  Give me one second. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=84.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=85.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=88.48s)]
*  So I don't think we're going to get to talk to her. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=88.88s)]
*  We don't, I don't know if she's in or not, but I think that that door slam was really telling. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=92.32s)]
*  So I don't think they want to talk to us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=97.92s)]
*  Dear AOC, please don't lie about American citizens. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=99.72s)]
*  Love, Chaya. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=109.4s)]
*  What's so funny is that Sandy Cortez would not exist as a public figure were it not for social media. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=114.04s)]
*  She literally filmed herself applying makeup and then her staff seemed shocked that maybe this is on video. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=118.68s)]
*  Hi, right chick is the founder of Libs of TikTok and the woman you just saw in that video. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=124.32s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=128.32s)]
*  Hi, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=129.28s)]
*  I mean, did you think that she would own up to the provable lie she told about you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=131.8s)]
*  I mean, she claimed that something didn't happen that you proved on video did happen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=138.16s)]
*  Did you think she would admit that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=142.08s)]
*  AOC claimed that I lied about Boston Children's Hospital. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=147.84s)]
*  She claimed that I inspired a bomb threat and I absolutely had no expectations for her to own up to it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=151.68s)]
*  I went to her office and I was ready to sit down with her and get to the bottom of this and explain it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=157.88s)]
*  And she, I don't know if she was in the office or not, but I don't, she cowered away. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=163.24s)]
*  I don't think she would ever face me or ever have a discussion about it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=168.12s)]
*  But I, as an American citizen, I don't appreciate being defamed in front of millions of people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=171.56s)]
*  So I wanted to confront her and she cowered. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=176.28s)]
*  I mean, thank you for adding details that I should have added in the intro. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=180.88s)]
*  She accused you of inspiring violence, of effectively a criminal act. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=185.12s)]
*  Yeah, and she is unfortunately protected by legislative privilege. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=193.84s)]
*  So she is allowed to lie about me in a committee hearing and not just that, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  but she's using her position of power to call on Big Tech to censor people who she disagrees with. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=203.04s)]
*  That's what she did in the hearing and that is really scary. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=210.6s)]
*  It's really scary. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=213.72s)]
*  And thank you for trying to face her directly, which is a nice thing to do in a social media age. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=215.04s)]
*  Hi, Richick, Libs of TikTok. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=221.32s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=228.44s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKSPYoK6qU&t=232.16s)]
