# Candace Owens: This Democrat effort is aimed at censoring speech
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE)
*  Candace Owens is saying a lot about it, has for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=0.0s)]
*  She's host of Candace and we're always happy [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=2.08s)]
*  to have her on the show tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=3.98s)]
*  Candace, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=5.14s)]
*  So at the same time that they're, you know, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  addressing these big theoretical macro issues [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=10.18s)]
*  and changing the American Criminal Justice Code [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=12.94s)]
*  to be race specific, something it's never been, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=15.46s)]
*  they're ignoring the collapse of daily life [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=18.38s)]
*  for their constituents. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=22.3s)]
*  You see this everywhere, what is it? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=24.26s)]
*  We don't know what it is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=27.94s)]
*  It does seem to be a very strange collision [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=28.84s)]
*  and seeing her put this forth is just actually, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=31.92s)]
*  I'm incredulous and selfishly I'd like to see it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=34.68s)]
*  go into place for maybe just one day [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=37.8s)]
*  because it would be brilliant for black conservatives [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=39.64s)]
*  because every single Democrat would fall by their sword. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=41.88s)]
*  Of course they reserve their most hatreds [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=44.04s)]
*  and the most vitriol for black conservatives, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=45.64s)]
*  people like myself, Larry Elder, Clarence Thomas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=47.44s)]
*  They'd all be locked up federally. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=49.68s)]
*  Trust you if they've actually gotten put into place. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=51.36s)]
*  But I think it also yields more questions for me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=54.86s)]
*  I'm looking at this and I'm going, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=57.2s)]
*  what are they possibly thinking? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=58.220000000000006s)]
*  How would this work? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  What about black on black criticism? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  Would they lock me up for saying something [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=62.06s)]
*  like, you know, Shiela Jackson is fundamentally [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=64.78s)]
*  a low IQ hateful individual? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=66.86s)]
*  I'm just saying that I don't wanna go to prison. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=68.86s)]
*  I'm giving you a what if scenario. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=70.58s)]
*  If I did say that, would I go to prison? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  And how is this going to run parallel [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=73.26s)]
*  to their decriminalization efforts, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=74.78s)]
*  They don't want any black and brown people in prison. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=76.94s)]
*  They want them all to be on the streets, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=79.06s)]
*  but at the same time they're saying [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=81.34s)]
*  that they will lock us up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=82.5s)]
*  And by the way, would this extend to an overseas policy? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=83.58s)]
*  Would I be locked up if I said anything bad [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=86.56s)]
*  about the late Osama Bin Laden? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course this wasn't well thought through, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=90.56s)]
*  but because it doesn't need to be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=92.68s)]
*  We know that their every effort [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=93.98s)]
*  is aimed at censoring speech, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=95.56s)]
*  The Democrats know that in order for them to be omnipotent, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=98.54s)]
*  they need to be able to control words, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=101.04s)]
*  because if they can control words, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  they can control thoughts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  And ultimately what they're after is brainwash. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, they've been really good at brainwash. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=107.72s)]
*  If you're speaking of what you just spoke about, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  you have people that are graduating. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=111.92s)]
*  I just talked about this today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  Graduating Harvard who actually believe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=115.02s)]
*  that men can be women and women can be men, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=117.5s)]
*  and all we have to do is change our minds. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=119.38s)]
*  So they know exactly what they're doing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=121.08s)]
*  They know exactly what they're after. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=122.5s)]
*  And ultimately what they want is full power and control [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=123.78s)]
*  over every single person and their households. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=126.5s)]
*  And they'll use law enforcement to do it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=129.58s)]
*  And the police and the FBI and the courts. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=131.74s)]
*  I wonder if we've laughed too much [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=135.8s)]
*  at the absurdity of all of this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=138.78s)]
*  and not internalized how deadly serious they are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=140.5s)]
*  about using power to crush their political opponents. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=143.1s)]
*  Oh, I have been laughing, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=147.72s)]
*  but at the same time pointing people to the very real truth [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=149.04s)]
*  and said that what they truly want is a totalitarian society. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=151.2s)]
*  They are following the playbook, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=154.4s)]
*  everything that they are after. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=156.0s)]
*  They are attacking religion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=157.28s)]
*  They are attacking the first amendment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=158.76s)]
*  They continually want to remove guns from your households. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=160.44s)]
*  I mean, what does that spell out to you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=162.84s)]
*  Where have we seen this before? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=164.04s)]
*  In every communist society that exists, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=165.4s)]
*  that has existed and does exist today, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=167.6s)]
*  because that is what needs to happen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=169.48s)]
*  They need to remove individual power. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=170.72s)]
*  And what's been very interesting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  is seeing how they're breaking down people's mentality, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=174.18s)]
*  We are becoming a fundamentally weak country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=177.02s)]
*  You have people that cry at the drop of a hat [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=179.9s)]
*  because they've been misgendered. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=182.1s)]
*  Of course, they know that these people [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  are not going to be able to take them on in the future. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  You think these people are going to stand up to government [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=187.54000000000002s)]
*  when they can't even stand up to themselves [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=188.9s)]
*  and look themselves in the mirror and say, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=190.46s)]
*  no, actually, I cannot be this person. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  I can't just wake up and say that I'm a man or I'm a woman. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=194.46s)]
*  So it's so Machiavellian, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  and it's so important that we keep talking about it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=199.46s)]
*  You can laugh to stay sane, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=201.44s)]
*  but also recognize that something very real [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=203.55999999999997s)]
*  is happening in this country, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=205.88s)]
*  and it's dangerous and it's sinister. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=207.16s)]
*  That could not have happened five years ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=210.6s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=211.92s)]
*  Candace Owens, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=213.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=214.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlsYvAnz3vE&t=217.07999999999998s)]
