# Tulsi Gabbard blasts political leaders for considering nuclear attack on Russia
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc)
*  Tulsi Gabbard has thought a lot about this, of course, a former congressman from Hawaii, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=0.0s)]
*  currently a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=3.64s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=6.28s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=7.28s)]
*  Does what's happening in eastern Ukraine, whatever you think of it, constitute a core [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=9.16s)]
*  American interest, do you believe? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=16.36s)]
*  Look at what Senator Wicker is saying. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=18.52s)]
*  I want to go back to that for a second here, because anyone who would propose or even consider [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=19.96s)]
*  what he is saying as an option must be insane, a sociopath or a sadist, because let's just [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=26.88s)]
*  understand here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=33.56s)]
*  So he's saying, let's go and launch a nuclear attack that would start a war that would destroy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=34.56s)]
*  the American people, our country and the world, and also the Ukrainians, so that we can save [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=40.16s)]
*  Ukraine's democracy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it literally is insane. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=48.32s)]
*  And the crazy thing, Tucker, is Senator Wicker is not an outlier. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  He's the number two Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and you're hearing the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=54.96s)]
*  same kind of rhetoric coming from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, in the administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  and in the media, who have no problem with this, because they actually agree with it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  They're pushing this same narrative themselves. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=68.52s)]
*  And this is why it is such a dangerous situation that we are facing as we are being pushed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=71.48s)]
*  closer and closer very quickly, as you said, to a hot war, a nuclear war that would destroy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  the world as we know it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=82.84s)]
*  Over eastern Ukraine, I mean, the sad thing is in Washington, you served in the Congress, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  people like Roger Wicker are considered highly informed intellectuals. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=89.12s)]
*  America deserves better than Roger Wicker, I think it's fair to say. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=92.76s)]
*  But they live in an airless world where they repeat back to one another, both parties, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=95.28s)]
*  the same stupid talking points. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Do they know how disconnected from reality this is? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be the case. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=106.04s)]
*  And this just points to their ineptness, their lack of a capability to really clearly see [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=109.96s)]
*  what the consequences are of their rhetoric, of what the actions—and this isn't just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=116.56s)]
*  empty words. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=122.72s)]
*  There are consequences to leaders in our country, influential people in our country, to throwing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=123.72s)]
*  things out like a first-use nuclear attack is on the table. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=129.84s)]
*  This directly undermines our national security. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  It directly puts the American people and our country and the world at risk, Tucker. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=139.6s)]
*  And what are we trying to accomplish here? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=145.16s)]
*  Because that will be the result. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  That's—so that—and this is a much longer conversation, but in a minute, why eastern [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=150.24s)]
*  Ukraine? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you can think of lots of parts of the world that are critical to our national [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  interests, the shipping lanes in the South China Sea, for example, or lots of things. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  You could argue we have to defend this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=161.6s)]
*  But Ukraine? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=164.84s)]
*  We've been talking about Ukraine for years. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=165.84s)]
*  What is this? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=168.52s)]
*  The thing that I see here, Tucker, that is the same neocons and neolibs in Washington [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=170.52s)]
*  who dragged our country into regime change wars in places like Iraq and Libya and Syria, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  the same ones who are pushing us very quickly into this war with Russia and never stating [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=181.8s)]
*  once, hey, what's our objective? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=188.4s)]
*  What are we trying to accomplish here? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=190.52s)]
*  And how does it serve our country's national security interests? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=192.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=195.4s)]
*  And I think one of them are pointing that out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=197.28s)]
*  This is not some Stone Age land in South Asia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=198.88s)]
*  This is a real country with nuclear weapons and an actual army. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=201.84s)]
*  Like these— [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=205.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=206.6s)]
*  This is just too crazy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=207.6s)]
*  And by the way, they have more nuclear weapons than we do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=208.6s)]
*  So thinking you're just going to launch a nuclear attack and not see a consequence [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  that will lead to a nuclear war that destroys the world is, again, insane, inept, and I [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=214.94s)]
*  don't know how many more words we can use to describe it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  People should not be in positions of power to make these decisions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=225.2s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=228.72s)]
*  I also have run out of adjectives, but I agree with the ones you used. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=229.72s)]
*  Chelsea Gabbard, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=233.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITopRyqyYc&t=235.2s)]
