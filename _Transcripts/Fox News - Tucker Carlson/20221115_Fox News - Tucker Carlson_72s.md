# 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' celebrates 6 years on the air
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g)
*  The time flies when you're doing what you love and tonight is the sixth anniversary of the of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Tucker Carlson tonight, this show. I'm so honored to be here on Tucker's behalf and to congratulate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=5.84s)]
*  him on the great success that he's seen over the years and to say thank you to all of you who are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=12.0s)]
*  choosing to spend your time here with us. I'm sure that Tucker's supporters and detractors alike [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  cannot deny that Tucker is carrying out exactly what he promised to do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  What's the show going to be about? You can judge for yourself, but here's the basic theme of it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=30.88s)]
*  People in power tend to lie, not because they want to, but because they can't help themselves. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=35.12s)]
*  That's human nature. The more power people have, the bigger the temptation to misuse it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=39.76s)]
*  The press is supposed to be the watchdog against all of this and it worked fine for a couple of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=44.16s)]
*  centuries. But then the press decided they had more in common with certain politicians than with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=47.68s)]
*  readers or viewers and that's when it fell apart. We're going to get back to basics here. We're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  going to hold the powerful accountable. Pierce Pomposity, Translate Double Speak, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=54.64s)]
*  mock smugness and barbecue nonsense every night. And that's about it for us tonight. Of course, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=58.88s)]
*  tune in each night right here at eight o'clock to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  pomposity, smugness and group think. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxbRvQVI6g&t=69.52s)]
