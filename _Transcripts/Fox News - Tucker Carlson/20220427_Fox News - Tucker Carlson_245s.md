# Jack Brewer demands Joy Reid apologize for race comments or face possible lawsuit
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus)
*  Well, Joy Reid has defamed a lot of people during her time at MSNBC. Now she's targeted somebody [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=0.0s)]
*  who's going to fight back. Jack Brewer is a former NFL player and a philanthropist. He's threatening [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=4.96s)]
*  to sue Joy Reid over a tweet she sent about an event featuring the governor of Florida, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=9.36s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. Reid claimed that a picture of young African-American boys at that event was, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=14.88s)]
*  quote, tantamount to child abuse. Brewer says the boys in that photo are students he was mentoring [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=20.0s)]
*  and they knew exactly what they were doing. We thought we'd ask them about it. Jack Brewer is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=27.2s)]
*  the founder of the Jack Brewer Foundation and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Mr. Brewer, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=30.72s)]
*  thanks so much for coming on. So child abuse, what, I mean, that's a very heavy charge. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=34.16s)]
*  It really is. First off, Tucker, I'm a man of God and those kids that you see are children of God [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=40.96s)]
*  and that's what principles that we stand on at the Jack Brewer Foundation, particularly our [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=45.68s)]
*  hero kids. You say, I don't believe that Joy really understood who she was dealing with and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=50.56s)]
*  the annoyance that's on our lives. God called us right now to face this CRT. These same kids, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=55.68s)]
*  the majority that you see in that picture that are with me are fatherless kids, kids that come [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=61.04s)]
*  to our center each and every day to learn the reading the map proficiency. When they go to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=65.36s)]
*  public schools and their teachers tell them that if they make a 50 or 60 that it's okay because [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=70.24s)]
*  they're black kids. We fight against that. We teach our kids that in America everybody can win, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=75.68s)]
*  everybody can reach and achieve the goals that they set forth. And so we are patriots and I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=81.6s)]
*  don't think that people like Joy Reed are used to seeing African-American young boys that are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=86.16s)]
*  fatherless that love this country and understand really what their potential is. And that's what we [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  teach and that's what we show. And so I don't hate Joy Reed. I dislike her comments, but I pray for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  her because she should be on our side. If she really cares that America is the most fatherless [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  nation in the world, the entire world on the planet, America has more fatherless kids. She [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=108.0s)]
*  should be fighting on my side over here. I work and serve these children each and every day. They [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=113.52s)]
*  eat my food at my house. They sleep on my couch. When they need some new shoes, I buy them. When [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=118.64s)]
*  they need new clothes, I buy them. And so for her to come at me like that and to accuse me of child [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=123.68s)]
*  abuse, when I've poured my entire life, heart and soul into going out and serving the most underserved [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=129.44s)]
*  kids in our nation, I have a real problem with that. She is going to have to apologize. I want [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=135.28s)]
*  MSNBC to apologize. Otherwise, I'm going to have to pursue my legal strategy that my lawyers are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=140.32s)]
*  putting together. I got to add, and thank you, because that's too much. Of all the things you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=147.6s)]
*  can be mad about in this world, and there are a lot to be mad about, I would say right now, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=152.32s)]
*  she's mad because little kids without dads are getting help from somebody? Like why do you think [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=156.64s)]
*  that made her so angry? Because she's not used to it. It doesn't fit her perspective and the less [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=162.4s)]
*  perspective in this woke agenda that's taken over this country. The heart and soul of the most [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=168.88s)]
*  voiceless kids in our country right now are young, fraudulence African-American boys who are locked up [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=174.0s)]
*  too much in our prisons, who are overlooked, and no one really speaks for them. Well, I got a group [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=179.44s)]
*  of black boys that will tell you right now that they give it all they got, and we sit on God's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=184.32s)]
*  principles. We put the word of God, we pray over our kids each and every day, and we know the great [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=189.12s)]
*  men they're going to become. She's not used to hearing that. That's not what the left wants to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=194.72s)]
*  tell you. We are not oppressed. We are not victims, right? We love everybody. We love our God, but we [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=198.8s)]
*  love our neighbor as ourselves, and I think she needs to do some deep soul searching, and everybody [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=205.44s)]
*  on the left right now that is pushing this victimization upon young black kids who really, at the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=210.32s)]
*  end of the day, are the heartbeat of our nation. When we uplift our poor black voiceless kids, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=215.76s)]
*  this nation is going to change, Tucker. I'm telling you it is, and I believe it, and I'll stand on that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=220.88s)]
*  all day. Amen. It seems like a really positive thing. She's a cynical person, and I hope you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=225.84s)]
*  get an apology. You deserve one. Mr. Brewer, thank you for joining us tonight. Subscribe to the Fox [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRtI718Mus&t=231.35999999999999s)]
