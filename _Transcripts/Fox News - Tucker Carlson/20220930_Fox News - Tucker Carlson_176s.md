# Candace Owens: Democrats are utter psychopaths and this is just one example
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40)
*  Candace Owens is a keen observer of all of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=0.0s)]
*  She hosts a great podcast. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=3.12s)]
*  She joins us tonight with reaction. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=4.16s)]
*  Candace Owens, I would love to see someone die in this country without getting a lecture [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=5.36s)]
*  posthumously. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Oh, you died of smoking. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  You died because you didn't get the facts. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  You died because you drive an FTV. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=13.92s)]
*  Can we just acknowledge death as a sad thing, give it the reverence it deserves and move [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=15.6s)]
*  on? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=19.8s)]
*  Well, not if you're a member of the Democratic Party, because there are utter sociopaths [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=20.8s)]
*  and psychopaths. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=25.92s)]
*  And when they see these tragedies take place, by the way, this is the same methodology [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=26.92s)]
*  that takes place with school shootings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  You would think that we could mourn and we can be sad, but they say, wait a second, there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=32.64s)]
*  are some children that are dead. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=36.040000000000006s)]
*  So allow us to get in front of cameras and tell you why you need to give us more power. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=37.72s)]
*  And the fact that they think about their own power and consuming more power when tragedy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  strikes is, as I said, an example of their utter, that they are utter psychopaths. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=45.0s)]
*  And what's going on obviously is an extreme tragedy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=49.36s)]
*  But as you pointed out, Tucker, it is a natural tragedy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  The earth has hurricanes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=54.6s)]
*  There was no human beings that walked the face of the planet. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=55.96s)]
*  There would continue to be hurricanes like there would continue to be blizzards and like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  there would continue to be tornadoes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=62.0s)]
*  There's no lobby, in my opinion, that should be laughed at harder than the climate lobby, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=64.28s)]
*  because they just keep being proven wrong. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=68.44s)]
*  Now, when I was a kid, I was told it was global warming. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Hide under your desk, kids. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=73.04s)]
*  The polar bears are going to drown because there's global warming. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  But they stopped using that language around 2011 because accidentally the earth started [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  to cool and disproved their narrative. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=81.44s)]
*  Before my generation, by the way, Tucker, there was a generation that was told global [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=83.86s)]
*  cooling was going to spell the end of the world, except what happened was they were [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=87.14s)]
*  proven wrong and the earth started to warm. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=90.26s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=92.3s)]
*  There was the ozone layer. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  Remember the ozone layer, the hole in the ozone layer? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=94.74s)]
*  Oops, that actually wasn't a tragedy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=97.02s)]
*  And so they moved on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=98.86s)]
*  There was the acidic oceans. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=100.36s)]
*  There's going to be acidic rain because the oceans were acid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=102.18s)]
*  Oops, that didn't happen. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=104.9s)]
*  And so they moved on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=106.22s)]
*  They've been wrong over and over and over again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=107.22s)]
*  Your climate models are a complete fraud, and yet they're still allowed to look you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=110.04s)]
*  in the face when a natural disaster strikes and tell you, well, you know what, I know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  we've been wrong forever and we've never once gotten it right, but give us your money [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  anyways. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  These people are sick. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  Well, I completely agree with that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  In general, people's kooky theories don't bother me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  You can be a flat-earther, a circumcision activist. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, you can be whatever you want to be. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=130.36s)]
*  But if you try and take over my power grid on the basis of your ridiculous theories, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=132.32s)]
*  then I think we have a right to fight back, no? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  We absolutely have a right to fight back, and where we need to start is in the education [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=139.2s)]
*  system because my mind was polluted about climate change or about global warming, rather, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=142.32s)]
*  because they sat us down in health class and they made us watch Inconvenient Truth by Al [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=146.88s)]
*  Gore. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=150.48s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=151.48s)]
*  It never came into fruition, and they keep focusing on these young generations to sell [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=152.48s)]
*  them fear for their own power. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  You're totally—man, no one can sum it up more crisply than you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Candace Owens, thank you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=162.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Our Nightly Opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=169.2s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jim_3ztX40&t=173.88s)]
