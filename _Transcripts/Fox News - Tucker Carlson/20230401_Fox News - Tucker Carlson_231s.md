# Stephen Miller: This is Trump's real crime
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA)
*  Stephen Miller is a former senior advisor to Donald Trump. He's founder of America First Legal. He joins us tonight to assess Stephen Miller [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering what you think of that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Sort of came to that after watching this Trump saga for the last seven years [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  That seems to be the third rail really is the foreign policy questions [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=13.16s)]
*  Yes, and I lived through it Tucker [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=19.72s)]
*  I lived through it by this man's side for those seven years the moment that he got the nomination [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=21.64s)]
*  We watched as the hidden power centers in this country came out from underneath their rocks and began to pull the strings that they control [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=27.88s)]
*  They began to leak information designed to sabotage him at every turn [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=36.0s)]
*  They begin to use every organ of control they have in the intelligence community the national security community the law enforcement community [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=39.84s)]
*  To try to control him and to control his presidency [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=46.8s)]
*  Russia is the central example of this they tried desperately to keep him from pursuing detente with Russia [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=49.96s)]
*  They tried desperately to keep him from holding that summit with Vladimir Putin to try to have a relationship between our two countries [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=56.48s)]
*  Now look what has happened now that he is out of office [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  We are on the brink of a world war Tucker as soon as they pushed him out of office [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=66.6s)]
*  Look what happened we are now almost in a nuclear conflict over the borders of Ukraine [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=71.8s)]
*  So you asked me what it's all Trump's crime. We know it's not a financial crime [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=77.12s)]
*  We know it's not a campaign finance crime his crime is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=81.36s)]
*  refusing to bow or bend to the corrupt and rotten foreign policy establishment that is used to always [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=85.16s)]
*  Always getting their way in this country and and and that has much greater control over our system [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=92.16s)]
*  I think any of us appreciate I mean you look at John Cornyn the Republican senator from Texas who I think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=98.24s)]
*  Most people I speak for myself sort of assumed he was kind of conservative [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=102.52s)]
*  And then you realize when you view it through the lens of what's happening in Ukraine John Cornyn and Mitch McConnell [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=105.48s)]
*  And Tom Tillis and almost every Republican senator is a screaming liberal actually [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=110.92s)]
*  And if it weren't for foreign policy you wouldn't know that you wouldn't know that they are completely aligned [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=116.68s)]
*  With Chuck Schumer and the Democrats and Joe Biden so there really is a unit party on these the most important questions [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, there's obviously an ideological disease that courses through Washington [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=130.08s)]
*  When it comes to foreign policy and the sacrifice of our interest of foreign nations and foreign profits [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=134.76s)]
*  But it's even deeper than that and I know this because I also worked on the hill for almost a decade the intelligence community is able to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=140.54s)]
*  manipulate the intelligence process and the relationship with lawmakers in order to obtain the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  Answers that they want from Congress so when it comes to an issue like the Patriot Act they can leak what they need to leak [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  They can push the narratives they need to push they can manufacture the threats they need to manufacture [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=159.44s)]
*  And they can work the relationships that they have in order to obtain the outcome that they want and that has always been true on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  Foreign policy for many many many years then Donald Trump comes up onto the scene of Washington a man of with whom they have no [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=169.78s)]
*  Relationship a man who has no affinity for them who doesn't care about them [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=177.46s)]
*  Who doesn't value what they value and this for them is a panic moment? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=180.78s)]
*  It is a panic moment and we are now living in the seventh year of that panic [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=185.14s)]
*  Turning our entire democracy upside down and I will tell you if a prosecutor in Manhattan [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=190.34s)]
*  Can take control of our entire presidential election process then by what definition can we say that we even have a democracy in this country? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  No, I mean we were mocked. I thought justly by the president of El Salvador yesterday [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=204.38000000000002s)]
*  He said we're not gonna take any more lectures about democracy from a country that interferes in its own elections like this and unfortunately [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=209.36s)]
*  He's right. He is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=215.38000000000002s)]
*  Steven Miller great to see you tonight. Thank you for that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKFPbd5sJA&t=216.58s)]
