# Critics call this new TV series an 'unhinged right-wing revenge fantasy'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I)
*  What do you think of Amazon? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=0.0s)]
*  Pretty cool that they made it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=2.4s)]
*  Terminal List is based of course [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=3.84s)]
*  on a bestselling book by Jack Carr. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=5.22s)]
*  He's one of the executive producers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=7.88s)]
*  He's a former Navy SEAL, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=9.26s)]
*  one of the bestselling novelists in America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=10.36s)]
*  One of the good guys. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=12.6s)]
*  Jack Carr, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=13.44s)]
*  So it must please, first of all, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  congratulations on the book, the many books, this show, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=16.2s)]
*  but it must please you in a way, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=21.5s)]
*  not all viewers hate it, not all critics hate it, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=23.28s)]
*  but viewers like it much more than critics. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  It falls right in line with everything [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=30.14s)]
*  that I understand about the current culture [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=32.26s)]
*  and climate in America right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=34.12s)]
*  And it seems to have triggered [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=35.5s)]
*  quite a few of these critics. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=36.82s)]
*  And I have a couple of examples here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Daily Beast titled their review, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=39.3s)]
*  The Terminal List is an unhinged right wing revenge fantasy, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=41.08s)]
*  which is odd because right, left, conservative, liberal [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=45.3s)]
*  are not even mentioned in the show, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=48.46s)]
*  but I think it may be because the protagonist [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=49.94s)]
*  is competent with weapons and tactics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=52.28s)]
*  He's strong. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  He holds those in power accountable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=55.46s)]
*  And that could be unsettling for some, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=57.5s)]
*  particularly some maybe senior members of the military [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=58.98s)]
*  who have failed upwards over the last 20 years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=61.3s)]
*  They go on to write, there is some serious danger [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  to The Terminal List pandering to red state viewers [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=66.5s)]
*  with routine references to beer, guns, country music, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=68.82s)]
*  and hunting. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=73.34s)]
*  The Daily Beast does not like those things. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=74.46s)]
*  It does not sound like it is much fun over there, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=76.34s)]
*  but the 95% viewer rating, audience rating [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=78.56s)]
*  makes it all worth it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=82.1s)]
*  We didn't make it for the critics. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=83.06s)]
*  We made it for those in the arena. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  We made it for the soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=85.94s)]
*  that went downrange to Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=88.32s)]
*  so they could sit on the couch and say, hey, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  these guys put in the work. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=91.74s)]
*  They put in the effort to make something special [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=92.94s)]
*  and make a show that speaks to them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=95.27999999999999s)]
*  And that 95% rating lets me know that we at least got close. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=97.88s)]
*  And then one more line here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=101.32s)]
*  It's from TV Line. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  It says, the fugitive meets SEAL team, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  meets a don't tread on me truck decal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  We're served up huge helpings of red meat masculinity [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=108.0s)]
*  and lots and lots of American flags. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  They don't like American flags over there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=113.32s)]
*  Game Rant even cites revolutionary war era, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=115.16s)]
*  don't tread on me flags as a negative. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=118.88s)]
*  So it's odd that both Game Rant's and TV Line [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  had to go back to the 1700s to take [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=123.32s)]
*  the side of the British in their reviews. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=125.08s)]
*  I found that quite telling. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=126.88s)]
*  But someone wrote a horrible review of one of my latest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=128.96s)]
*  novel, In the Blood. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=132.56s)]
*  And they said something along the lines of, what do you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=133.44s)]
*  even call a book like this? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=135.96s)]
*  And you call it a number one New York Times bestselling novel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=137.24s)]
*  And someone wrote the same thing about this show. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=141.0s)]
*  And you call that the number one series on Prime Video. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=143.96s)]
*  And I do want to thank Amazon, because they took a lot of risks [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=147.6s)]
*  with this show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=150.44s)]
*  And they took those risks with us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=151.28s)]
*  And so my hat is off to them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=153.08s)]
*  And I'm sincerely humbled and grateful. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=154.96s)]
*  Jack Carr, who not that long ago was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=157.32s)]
*  wearing government-issued clothing carrying [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  a rifle in weird countries. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=160.24s)]
*  It is just amazing how successful you have been [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=161.56s)]
*  and wonderful to watch, for real. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=164.24s)]
*  Jack Carr, thank you for joining us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xq5YtPE8I&t=166.72s)]
