# Economist warns Tucker why more banks could ‘go belly up’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs)
*  Stephanie Pomboy, founder of Macro Maven. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us to kind of untangle the insanity here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=2.44s)]
*  I'm not, you know, Stephanie, I have to say, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=6.42s)]
*  you're one of the very few people who called this early [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  and said they're gonna be tragic and distorting effects [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=10.38s)]
*  of flooding the American economy with fake money [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=14.44s)]
*  from the Federal Reserve. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=16.84s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=17.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, it was hardly a radical conclusion to draw [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=20.56s)]
*  when you slather on layers and layers of debt on an economy [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  and encourage people to take reckless risk. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  And then you ratchet up interest rates [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  at the fastest rate in history. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=34.4s)]
*  I mean, God knows, the surprise is that it took this long [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=35.96s)]
*  for the bodies to float to the surface. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=39.56s)]
*  And honestly, Tucker, this banking thing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  is particularly remarkable because of the level of impunity [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=43.72s)]
*  that the banks evidenced. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=48.86s)]
*  And you've talked about, you know, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=50.44s)]
*  this whole diversity, equity, inclusion, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  and the woke agenda and this idea that, you know, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=54.12s)]
*  banking doesn't need to be boring. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  You used to want to get away from the banker [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  at the cocktail party. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=61.76s)]
*  Now he's throwing confetti and he's got a lampshade [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=62.84s)]
*  on his head and he's the life of the party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=65.76s)]
*  But the reality is these problems [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=68.28s)]
*  at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=70.64s)]
*  their pursuit of these woke agendas may make them, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=73.2s)]
*  let's hope, exceptional. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=77.36s)]
*  I mean, hopefully these videos aren't pervasive [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  to the entire banking sector, although they may very well be. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=82.72s)]
*  But ultimately, the entire banking sector [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=86.04s)]
*  did the same thing, and that is that they watched [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=88.48s)]
*  their deposit base wither over the last 12 months [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  while the Fed was raising interest rates [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=95.04s)]
*  because people like you and me looked at it and said, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  why am I putting my money in the bank and getting zero [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  when I can buy a treasury bill and get three, four, 5% [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=103.4s)]
*  as the Fed kept raising rates? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=107.28s)]
*  So their deposit base was shrinking. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, all those assets that they held [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=110.98s)]
*  that you talked about last night, the treasuries [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  and whatnot, were declining in value. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=115.4s)]
*  And they sat there and they did nothing about it, Tucker. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=119.0s)]
*  And they didn't just do that for one month or two months, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=121.0s)]
*  which might be excusable, but six, nine months go by [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  and the problems are getting worse and worse [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=127.24s)]
*  and they did nothing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Why did they do nothing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=130.76s)]
*  Because they knew all along when this day came, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=132.32s)]
*  the bailout would be there for them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  So the impunity of this banking system is beyond, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=137.54s)]
*  but they've been taught there are no consequences [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=141.26s)]
*  for mismanagement and this ridiculous, you know, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=143.72s)]
*  all these ridiculous woke priorities, which have, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=147.56s)]
*  you know, you should actually, when someone comes in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  and presents a business idea and wants a loan, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=152.8s)]
*  you should be looking at whether it's a viable business [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  model, not whether it's, you know, some sweaty teenager [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  in a hoodie with some harebrained scheme [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=161.24s)]
*  that you can throw money at without consequence. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=163.28s)]
*  But this is where we are and sadly, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  I think we're just at the beginning of this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  because the companies that SBB and these other banks [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=171.72s)]
*  lend money to are all going to go belly up [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=176.72s)]
*  just like the clients of SBB started to do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=178.92s)]
*  Hopefully they'll spare us the moral lectures. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=182.32s)]
*  They already pay half the tax rate we do in a lot of cases. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=184.3s)]
*  It's a little much, I would say. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=187.2s)]
*  Stephanie Pombo, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=188.6s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=190.04s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tucker. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWOm4c71Bs&t=191.52s)]
