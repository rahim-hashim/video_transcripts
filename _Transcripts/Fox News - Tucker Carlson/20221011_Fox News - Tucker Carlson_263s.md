# Tulsi Gabbard explains her decision to leave the Democratic Party
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg)
*  Tulsi Gabbard joins us tonight and we're happy that she is. Tulsi Gabbard, thank you so much [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=0.0s)]
*  for coming on. That was quite a statement. I'm listening to this and I'm thinking, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=4.4s)]
*  we have Republicans on the show from time to time. They don't put it as clearly and bravely as you [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  do. So how do you feel? I mean, you've been in this party a long time. You were its future. You [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=13.68s)]
*  left. I mean, this has got to be kind of a fraught moment for you. You know, Tucker, as you know, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=17.44s)]
*  I've always been an independent minded person. Democrat, yes, but an independent Democrat. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=23.68s)]
*  My loyalties are very clear. I love our country and I took an oath both as a service member, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=30.64s)]
*  as a soldier, as well as a member of Congress to support and defend the Constitution. That's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=38.0s)]
*  an oath that I take extremely seriously. And so when you look at this party, the today's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=43.84s)]
*  Democratic Party, it's controlled by fanatical ideologues who hate freedom. They despise the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=49.84s)]
*  Constitution. They actively find ways to undermine our God given rights enshrined in the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=56.56s)]
*  Constitution, like freedom of speech. If you say something and I say something that they don't like [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=62.24s)]
*  instead of saying, you know what, agree to disagree, live and let live in the traditional [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  liberalist kind of way. No, that's not good enough. They will do all that they can to destroy you, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  silence you, smear you, work with big tech, work with corporate media to actively destroy anyone [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=77.92s)]
*  who dares to even question their agenda. They are against freedom of religion. They are hostile [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=83.2s)]
*  towards people of faith, people who have their own spiritual practice, especially Christians, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=90.08s)]
*  finding ways to be vindictive, to discriminate, to punish people who happen to exercise that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=95.68s)]
*  freedom of religion. The list goes on and on, but the foundation of freedom is really what was at [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=102.88s)]
*  the heart of my making this decision, that I cannot be a member of a party that is against [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=107.84s)]
*  freedom and actively trying to undermine it. Well, it was inspiring to hear that, but also [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=113.44s)]
*  disappointing. I mean, I feel like printing out your words and asking every Republican [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  candidate who comes on this show to read them. And if you can't read them, I'm not voting for you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Right? I mean, why is it so hard to say out loud, first of all, the people are always talking about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  racism or committing it. Why is that so hard for people to acknowledge? It's so obvious. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  It speaks to the whole environment of fear that those in power, these elitists in power have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=138.24s)]
*  fomented to where people are afraid to speak the truth. They're afraid to exercise their right to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=144.24s)]
*  free speech because, hey, you might lose your job. You might be canceled. You might be trashed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=149.2s)]
*  And God forbid in Washington, you might not be invited to the cool kids parties. You might not [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=153.52s)]
*  be as popular. And this is really what it comes down to is rather than taking a stand for peace, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=159.12s)]
*  for prosperity, security and freedom of the American people. We have too many people in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=165.6s)]
*  Washington who are warmongers subservient to the military industrial complex and continuing to put [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=170.0s)]
*  their own selfish interests or the interests of their donors first with no mind for the cost and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  consequence that their decisions have on the American people. This is exactly what we're seeing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=182.72s)]
*  right now with President Biden and leaders in Congress whose decisions are actively pushing us [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=186.56s)]
*  to the brink of a nuclear holocaust of which they may have their bunkers where they'll be safe, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=192.16s)]
*  but we the American people will have no shelter, no place to go, no place to hide and face the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  consequences that could destroy all of humanity in the world as we know it. You were the first [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=204.32s)]
*  person I heard say that back in February when this all started. I believe. Why run for president? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=210.32s)]
*  Well, it turns out you were absolutely really quick since you did serve for so many years in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=216.16s)]
*  the Congress in the party you just left. You know everybody of course. Has anyone called you today, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=220.88s)]
*  your former colleagues, Democrats to say anything to you? One. One got in touch with me and sent me [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=225.92s)]
*  a text message with three thumbs up. I would love to know who that is, but I'm glad you're influencing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=235.2s)]
*  people. Tulsi Gabbard, I'm not going to ask you what you're doing next. We will all watch, but I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=244.0s)]
*  hope you'll come back on the show soon. Thank you. I look forward to it. Thanks Tucker. Thank you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPJzybRqMbg&t=247.76s)]
