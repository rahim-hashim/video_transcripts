# Barstool's Dave Portnoy: 'I'm getting shadow banned'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI)
*  Well, Dave Portnoy first became famous for Barstool Sports, but then he became a cultural [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=0.0s)]
*  phenomenon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Last year, he's raised more than $40 million for small businesses suffering under Corona. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He also has a massive social media following because he is a free thinker. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=12.24s)]
*  He's not explicitly political or really political at all, but he says what he thinks and that's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=15.92s)]
*  a rare thing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=19.32s)]
*  And the authorities don't like it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=20.6s)]
*  Yesterday, he announced that he suspects he's being shadow banned on social media platforms. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=22.28s)]
*  That means these platforms are making it hard or impossible for people to view his posts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=27.2s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=31.6s)]
*  What could it be? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=57.2s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  We thought we would ask Dave Portnoy directly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=66.4s)]
*  Dave, thanks a lot for coming on. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=67.4s)]
*  So first of all, good for you for calling them on this in public. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=69.08s)]
*  That's really our only defense is sunlight here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=72.08s)]
*  Why do you think they would do this to you? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=75.76s)]
*  You're not running for anything, are you? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=78.44s)]
*  No, I'm not running for anything. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=80.84s)]
*  You never really know why they're doing it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=83.0s)]
*  It varies every time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=84.48s)]
*  There is something to say. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=86.8s)]
*  It's the algorithm and it may not be as devious, but the algorithm certainly plays to people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=87.92s)]
*  maybe more on the liberal side who don't like things you have to say. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=94.08s)]
*  So could it be I made fun of AOC for that tax dress when she's celebrating the rich? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=96.78s)]
*  That could be it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=101.32s)]
*  That actually got a little warning that this may be fake news. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=102.32s)]
*  And all I said was she was at the richest party, the rich. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=105.56s)]
*  That's really not like anything you have to check. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=108.28s)]
*  That's like saying it's getting dark tonight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=110.96s)]
*  People may not like that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=112.84s)]
*  Big pizza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=114.08s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=115.08s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=116.36s)]
*  Finance. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=117.36s)]
*  I certainly have gone hard at the AMC and the billionaires club. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=118.36s)]
*  So there's so many different angles. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=122.28s)]
*  But one thing's for sure. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=124.12s)]
*  If people in a certain side and it tends to be the big social media platforms don't like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=125.62s)]
*  what you have to say, there's no doubt that you start disappearing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=130.72s)]
*  And whether you like Trump, don't like Trump, I have no opinion on it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=134.12s)]
*  The fact they kicked him off Twitter and social media totally and then he have like at one [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=137.36s)]
*  point the Taliban on there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=142.12s)]
*  There's no rhyme or reason for what's happening basically in social media. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=143.6s)]
*  And it's important because so many people get their information from that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=146.56s)]
*  It really should be freedom of the press. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=150.12s)]
*  But you can't suppress people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=152.04s)]
*  At least you shouldn't be able to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=153.2s)]
*  Well shadow banning is the stealthiest way, the most passive aggressive feline creepy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=155.0s)]
*  way to do it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=159.6s)]
*  If they want you off Twitter, just say, hey, Dave Portnall, you can't use Twitter anymore [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=160.6s)]
*  or Instagram or whatever the platform is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=164.12s)]
*  But to shadow ban you, you don't even know what's happening. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=166.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=170.16s)]
*  Well, then you become the if you don't like me, become the crazy guy with strings in your [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=171.16s)]
*  apartment and be like, oh, this guy did it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=175.28s)]
*  If they came out and said, hey, we're banning Dave because he said something that the tax, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=177.2s)]
*  the rich or big piece or big finance, there'd be an uproar. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=182.24s)]
*  Here it's kind of hard to prove outside the very specific facts that one day or two days [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=186.2s)]
*  in a row I get no new followers on Instagram. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=191.44s)]
*  You kind of have to be savvy in that language. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  That's impossible. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=196.12s)]
*  It just can't happen when you have as many followers as I do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=197.12s)]
*  I'll go six months with thousands every day and then suddenly I have two. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=200.08s)]
*  I said something that people didn't like. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=203.6s)]
*  I joked at the outset, you're not running for anything. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=206.76s)]
*  But what if you wanted to run for something? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=209.08s)]
*  You can't really run for office in this country without social media. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=210.76s)]
*  That's how you get your message out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=214.0s)]
*  So I mean, these companies are basically controlling our elections. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=216.0s)]
*  I mean, how are they not? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=218.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, you certainly can put what is in people's feeds and I get that a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  lot with my own. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=226.12s)]
*  It's like, listen, Dave, we look at every single thing you do, whether it's pizza or [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=227.12s)]
*  whatever, and we can't find you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  Like it takes 10 minutes to find your post. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=233.8s)]
*  That's obviously a problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=236.08s)]
*  And if they're banning me, by the way, I eat pizza like that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=237.08s)]
*  My Instagram goes down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=240.44s)]
*  It's 99% taking bites of pizza. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=242.44s)]
*  Like if they're going to ban me for that or suppress me, God knows what they're doing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=244.68s)]
*  to really political people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  So it is a little bit nuts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  It is a little bit nuts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  You humiliated and tamed the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=254.56s)]
*  I hope you do the same thing to Google and Facebook. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=258.44s)]
*  I really do. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=260.76s)]
*  We're rooting for you, Dave Portnoy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=261.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=263.36s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ixiUim9tI&t=264.36s)]
