# Former Planned Parenthood director rips Supreme Court liberals
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg)
*  Supreme Court today heard arguments in an abortion case that has potential implications for Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's almost impossible to find any kind of rational commentary about this case. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=5.48s)]
*  If you go over to MSNBC, we try not to, but we did for your sake today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=9.76s)]
*  Here's the legal analysis of the case. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=16.04s)]
*  This is exactly what a society that is against women looks like. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=17.52s)]
*  And sadly, listen, we are not too far away from becoming Gilead 2.0. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=20.92s)]
*  It's month 5011 of the pandemic and women are still losing their jobs or dropping out of the workforce by the hundreds of thousands while men gain jobs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=25.979999999999997s)]
*  And states like Texas are saying under his eye as they wrench away a woman's right to an abortion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=36.06s)]
*  They keep using the word woman. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=42.86s)]
*  But of course, MSNBC and CNN, ABC News, NBC, the Democratic Party, they don't believe that there is a category such as women. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  So how is this a threat to women? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  Whatever. It's too stupid even to continue analyzing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=52.78s)]
*  The question is, what really did happen today in the Supreme Court? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood director who became a pro-life advocate. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  She's been watching very carefully. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=62.46s)]
*  She joins us tonight. Abby, thank you for coming on. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=63.62s)]
*  So what happened and what are the implications of this? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=66.22s)]
*  Well, I thought the solicitor did very well for Mississippi today, laying out the case. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  And of course, we saw some really interesting and quite honestly, idiotic comments coming from a couple of the liberal justices on the bench today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  Sotomayor actually saying that in the past 50 years, we haven't seen any advancement of medicine in maternal and fetal medicine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=84.98s)]
*  I mean, she actually said, I don't think we've had any scientific development. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=94.26s)]
*  So these are the same people that want us to follow the science. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=98.26s)]
*  But yet they're telling us there haven't been any scientific developments made in maternal and fetal medicine in the past 50 years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=101.5s)]
*  So it's pretty interesting. I mean, this case could completely gut Roe and Casey. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  So this could turn abortion back over to the states and allow states to enact their state constitutions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=115.34s)]
*  We know that 24 states would make abortion illegal because of trigger bans in their state. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  So this could have huge implications across our nation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=130.3s)]
*  But just to be clear, I mean, no honest legal analyst believes that Roe is an honest decision. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=134.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's grotesque. But if it were to disappear tomorrow, states would do what we call commit democracy, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=141.38000000000002s)]
*  Voters would get to decide what they think of abortion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=148.06s)]
*  That that would be the effect. Or am I missing something? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=150.22000000000003s)]
*  No, you're exactly right. And Gorsuch made that very clear on the bench when he was asking Biden's solicitor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  He said, you know, I just want to make this clear. It's not that abortion would be gone. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=159.94s)]
*  We're not here to say that the Supreme Court would be banning abortion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=164.62s)]
*  This would go back to the states, correct? Right. And and that's absolutely right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Well, no one ever says that. But it's true. People could actually vote on something for once. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=176.3s)]
*  Abby Johnson, great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0fDahfnvTg&t=180.5s)]
