# Tucker Carlson: Biden criminalizes dissent
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4)
*  So Joe Biden gave the most threatening presidential speech in American history last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=0.0s)]
*  He spoke in front of a blood red backdrop flanked by U.S. Marines. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=7.0s)]
*  And he delivered, if you take a step back, the blueprint for the rest of his administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=11.88s)]
*  Criminalized dissent, effectively ban the opposition and use the federal agencies to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=16.8s)]
*  transform America into a one party state. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=23.28s)]
*  It's called authoritarianism. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=26.48s)]
*  Here's what Biden said in a speech the White House advertised as non-political. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=28.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=32.48s)]
*  Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=33.56s)]
*  foundations of our republic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=39.44s)]
*  The Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=42.0s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  And that is a threat to this country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=50.0s)]
*  MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=52.44s)]
*  They do not believe in the rule of law. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  They do not recognize the will of the people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=57.76s)]
*  They refuse to accept the results of a free election. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=61.4s)]
*  They promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence that are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=64.4s)]
*  a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=69.8s)]
*  soul of this country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=77.2s)]
*  It's enough to make your head spin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=81.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has been banned from speaking in public. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=83.28s)]
*  He has been censored at the behest of the Democratic Party. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=87.56s)]
*  He can no longer go on social media, our electronic town square. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=90.64s)]
*  He's been totally erased. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  And yet, Joe Biden says, Trump and his supporters promote authoritarian leaders. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=99.08s)]
*  And he says this at exactly the moment that he is sending billions of dollars to Ukraine [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  and its authoritarian leaders every month. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=108.16s)]
*  Authoritarian? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=111.28s)]
*  Oh, that just scratches the surface. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=112.24s)]
*  Over the past year and a half, the government of Ukraine has jailed its top political rival. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  It has banned opposition parties and it has outlawed independent media. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=118.52s)]
*  Oh, but that's not authoritarian. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=124.0s)]
*  What's authoritarian is disagreeing with Joe Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=126.36s)]
*  Do that and Joe Biden will stand in front of the military he controls and declare that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=129.88s)]
*  you were an enemy of the state. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=133.8s)]
*  So watching the fanatical support of the White House for the actual [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=136.12s)]
*  authoritarians who run Ukraine, you can sort of see the template here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  But of course, as is always true when Joe Biden speaks, you can't hold him entirely [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=145.16s)]
*  responsible because not only did he not write the words, he's not aware that he spoke [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  them. Just the other day, he said after giving the speech when we're quoting, I don't [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=153.24s)]
*  consider any Trump supporter a threat to the country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=157.44s)]
*  That was on Friday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=160.28s)]
*  Our media seem to ignore that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=162.44s)]
*  We're very disappointed if they heard it because they listened exactly to the words [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=163.56s)]
*  Biden spoke. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=168.28s)]
*  And they love them. Watch. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=170.48s)]
*  President Biden gave a really strong speech and I loved it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=172.92s)]
*  I believe everything he said. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=177.84s)]
*  It was an urgent wartime address. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=180.8s)]
*  And something else that really stood out to me is that he almost seemed to sort of be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=183.84s)]
*  reclaiming patriotism. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=187.52s)]
*  If you look up fascism in the dictionary, you're going to find all of those things. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=189.6s)]
*  So I'm really not sure what the Republicans are all upset about other than the fact [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=194.2s)]
*  that it was named. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=198.2s)]
*  Obviously, Republicans, I think, are the biggest threat to democracy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=199.48s)]
*  We don't separate right wing extremists and Republican Party anymore. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=202.76s)]
*  Hillary Clinton told the truth when she said that there were deplorable people in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=206.12s)]
*  Republican Party supporting Donald Trump. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  And he was exciting a lot of racism and misogyny and bigotry. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  The Republicans who are like, oh, he's calling us fascists. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  If you're not a fascist, he's not talking about you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  So lighten up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  Oh, so if you're innocent, you have nothing to hide. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=226.44s)]
*  Don't worry. It's amazing how Soviet the whole thing is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=229.24s)]
*  Joe Biden calls for political purges and law enforcement crackdowns on his political [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=234.68s)]
*  opponents and state media cheer him on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  In his speech about the threats to our republic, Joe Biden doesn't mention anything [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=242.08s)]
*  but domestic threats. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=247.28s)]
*  He doesn't mention China a single time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=248.4s)]
*  He mentioned the border or fentanyl or crime. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=250.52s)]
*  He only mentioned people who oppose him politically. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=253.56s)]
*  And once again, like the obedient little servants, they are our media cheer him on. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=257.6s)]
*  You have to wonder about their views on authoritarianism. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=263.68s)]
*  Obviously, they're for it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=266.24s)]
*  In fact, one of these journalists wrote the speech. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=267.56s)]
*  That would be John Meacham, who wrote for many years at Newsweeklies and now is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=270.4s)]
*  America's most banal historian. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=275.28s)]
*  Apparently he had a hand in writing the speech last week. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=277.28s)]
*  He also redecorated the Oval Office at Joe Biden's request. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=279.64s)]
*  He is now our propagandist in chief. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's not hard to see what inspired Meacham to write that speech on Thursday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=285.12s)]
*  Meacham admires autocrats who silence their political opponents. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=288.88s)]
*  Earlier this year, Meacham went on television to compare the president of Ukraine, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  Zelensky, to Winston Churchill and the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  We want to prepare you now for a torrent of cliches, because those are the only [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=300.56s)]
*  chunks of language John Meacham is capable of using. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  Now that you're prepared, here it is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=306.88s)]
*  Quote, it may sound sentimental, but it has the virtue of being true. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=308.44s)]
*  Right. So at the same time, Zelensky, this Winston Churchill figure, was [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=312.88s)]
*  criminalizing dissent in his country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=317.08s)]
*  He shut down three television stations. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  As his spokesman put it, those media have become more the tools of war against [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine, so they are blocked in order to protect national security. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=325.52s)]
*  Oh, so the TV stations are sort of like Donald Trump or Fox News. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=329.4s)]
*  We need to silence them in order to preserve our democracy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=333.44s)]
*  Democracy, it was only one side gets to speak. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=336.24s)]
*  So it really is democracy circa 1972 Bulgaria. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  It's a democratic republic, meaning the people who live there have no [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=345.28s)]
*  representation whatsoever, the party decides. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=348.92s)]
*  It's hard to believe any of this is happening, but it is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  And on Thursday, Joe Biden and his speechwriter made it explicit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  So where's the pushback to this? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=358.72s)]
*  No president's ever given a speech like this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=360.56s)]
*  So you wonder where those pious defenders of our norms, Joe Biden [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=363.12s)]
*  announces that we need a one party state and he says it flanked by active [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=367.92s)]
*  duty U.S. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  Marines and nobody says a word. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=372.44000000000005s)]
*  Where was Mark Milley? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=374.8s)]
*  Isn't he a great defender of democracy? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=377.0s)]
*  Where were the Cheneys and everyone else who's upholding our sacred system of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=378.88000000000005s)]
*  government? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=385.48s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  Notting along too embarrassed to speak. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=388.56s)]
*  Now is the time to speak. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  They're always welcome to speak on this show. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  Always. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=393.92s)]
*  They're always invited here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  In the meantime, we turn to Jackson Hinkle. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  He's the host of the dive with Jackson Hinkle on YouTube. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=398.12s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=400.36s)]
*  Jackson, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=401.48s)]
*  So there's something really, look, I understand people are partisan on TV. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure to take your side side, but for Biden to get up there [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  and say the single biggest threat to our country is anyone who opposes me in the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  coming midterm elections and the media to not along makes you think we've crossed [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=415.36s)]
*  some kind of line. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=419.32s)]
*  We have crossed the line, Tucker, and it's so interesting that, you know, anyone [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=421.56s)]
*  in the media today would be saying that they liked what Joe Biden said in that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=426.56s)]
*  speech because it was a dictator inspired speech. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=431.28s)]
*  Not only that, but it seems like a lot of the practices and the actions that the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=434.44s)]
*  Biden administration is employing in the United States right now that were [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=438.8s)]
*  reflected in that speech are very closely aligned with what the dictator Zolinski [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=442.68s)]
*  is doing in Ukraine. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=447.84s)]
*  Joe Biden is plunging us into a fascist state and he is taking cues from what [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=449.28s)]
*  Zolinski is doing in Ukraine to manufacture this dystopian state and this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=454.52s)]
*  dystopian reality in America. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=458.8s)]
*  And there's no real surprise for me there because at the end of the day, Vladimir [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  Zolinski, the president of Ukraine and Joe Biden are controlled by the same [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=466.36s)]
*  exact people. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=470.76s)]
*  They're controlled by individuals like George Soros and controlled by people [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=471.6s)]
*  like Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=475.48s)]
*  And they're going to do whatever they want. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=478.16s)]
*  You know, to put it quite simply, Zolinski is using the intelligence community in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=480.6s)]
*  Ukraine and the Nazi Azov thugs in Ukraine to silence freedom loving [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukrainians. Joe Biden in the United States, though he can't remember what he [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=490.68s)]
*  had for breakfast this morning or who his wife is, his handlers and his cronies [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=494.76000000000005s)]
*  are prepping the CIA, the FBI, Antifa, the IRS and now Ministry of Truth to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  attack freedom loving Americans. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=505.12s)]
*  Maybe someone should have on the in the opposition party, the one he's calling [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  effectively illegal, should have paused before funding this insanity in Ukraine, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=513.04s)]
*  which is tanking our economy and making a mockery of democracy before signing off [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=518.8s)]
*  on it and just putting Ukrainian flag lapel pins on and nodding dutifully to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=524.36s)]
*  Joe Biden. Why didn't anyone do that? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=528.72s)]
*  You'd think that they do that, but so many of these individuals in Washington, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  D.C., the neoconservatives, the rhinos and the entire Democratic Party are [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=536.88s)]
*  beholden to the military industrial complex. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  And that is extremely out of line with what average Americans need right now. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=544.6s)]
*  We don't have clean drinking water in Jackson, Mississippi, yet we're sending [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=550.32s)]
*  seven billion dollars over to Ukraine, a country that I'm sure most of these [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=554.72s)]
*  congresspeople couldn't even point to on a map. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=558.52s)]
*  It's insane. The White House this week, Tucker, I'm sure you saw, came out and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=561.12s)]
*  said that anyone who doesn't hold an opinion reflected by the majority of the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=564.88s)]
*  American public is extreme and therefore an extremist. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=569.52s)]
*  Well, what does that make Joe Biden? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=573.48s)]
*  Only 38 percent of Americans, if you believe the polls and what they tell us, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=574.88s)]
*  if you believe they're that high, only 38 percent of Americans agree with Joe [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=579.6s)]
*  Biden. So by the White House's own definition, that makes him an extremist. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=582.96s)]
*  Yeah, and so much for minority rights also. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=588.12s)]
*  I mean, I thought you were allowed to disagree. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=590.72s)]
*  This really is quite a moment we're living through. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  Jack Stinkle, thanks so much. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=595.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0CI2uzIYK4&t=597.2s)]
