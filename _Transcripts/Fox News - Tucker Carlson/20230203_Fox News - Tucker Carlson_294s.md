# Hunter Biden laptop repairman tells all to Tucker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc)
*  So we wondered what John Paul MacIsaac thinks of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the author of American Injustice. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=3.06s)]
*  He joins us now with his lawyer, Brian Delarroca. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=4.7s)]
*  Thanks to both very much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=8.26s)]
*  John Paul MacIsaac, just to you first [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=12.42s)]
*  in the obvious question. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=14.26s)]
*  So here you really are the little guy in this case. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=15.4s)]
*  You're literally a small business owner [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=18.38s)]
*  and you're being threatened by the family [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=20.3s)]
*  that runs the country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=21.94s)]
*  Are you intimidated by this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=24.26s)]
*  You must be a little bit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=25.38s)]
*  I'm a little bit, but you gotta remember, Tucker, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  I've been dealing with intimidation from all fronts [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=30.32s)]
*  for the last couple of years. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  So I've kinda gotten used to it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=34.0s)]
*  This isn't as bad as being accused of being a traitor [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=35.36s)]
*  and working with Russia to affect an election, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=38.8s)]
*  but it's pretty close. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  So I would assume as a small business owner, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=43.0s)]
*  when someone drops a device off for you to repair, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  you want them to pick it up so you can get paid. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=49.68s)]
*  I assume you didn't wanna take the risk [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=53.28s)]
*  and you didn't wanna take possession [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=55.64s)]
*  of these devices, correct? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=57.74s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=61.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm in the business to recover data [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=62.3s)]
*  or repair and fix these products [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=65.14s)]
*  and I wanna get paid for these jobs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=67.1s)]
*  And I didn't. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=69.54s)]
*  Yeah, but that's your fault now? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=72.06s)]
*  Apparently it is. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=76.78s)]
*  I wanna ask your attorney a question as an attorney. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=79.34s)]
*  And so Hunter Biden is hired among many others [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=82.58s)]
*  by a man called Abby Lowell, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  who's a long-time democratic lawyer, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=87.92s)]
*  well-regarded among lawyers, extremely expensive, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  probably one of the most expensive attorneys [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=93.72s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=95.04s)]
*  Do you have any idea how Hunter Biden, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  who doesn't have a job that we know of, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=97.92s)]
*  who's all kinds of claims against him, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  baby mama among others, how is he affording Abby Lowell? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=103.16s)]
*  Well, that's the question that I have as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  That how many attorneys does he need? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=112.34s)]
*  He's got Abby Lowell, he's got attorneys representing him [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=115.06s)]
*  in quite a few of his criminal matters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=120.12s)]
*  How many does he need? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=123.78s)]
*  And the fact that Abby Lowell [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  actually went along with this letter, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  which really produced a lot of lies about John Paul, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=131.62s)]
*  saying that John Paul accessed the information [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=138.1s)]
*  without Hunter's consent, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=141.14s)]
*  when we have shown Hunter's consent, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=143.16s)]
*  everyone knows Hunter consented. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  The fact that this attorney would participate in this is, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, clearly this is not about Hunter Biden, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=154.64s)]
*  obviously, I'm guessing here I have no knowledge [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=157.64s)]
*  that I'm not disclosing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  But if a lifelong crackhead who's fighting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=161.42s)]
*  a million different battles on a million different fronts [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  and doesn't appear to have a job [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=166.76s)]
*  can afford Abby Lowell and a stable of other attorneys, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=168.32s)]
*  this is clearly an effort by the democratic establishment, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=172.1s)]
*  by donors to crush you guys for political reasons. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=174.14s)]
*  Is that an unfair assumption? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=177.42s)]
*  Well, that's exactly, that was the first thing I thought of. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  I received no notification of these letters [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=183.62s)]
*  until someone from CBS contacted me yesterday. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=186.66s)]
*  I was in the car and they asked for a comment [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=190.22s)]
*  and I had no idea what they were talking about. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=193.14s)]
*  When I read the letters, I was appalled. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=195.7s)]
*  This is really someone with so much money [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=199.7s)]
*  or acting like they have a lot of money [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=203.66s)]
*  going after someone who is really the little guy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=206.98s)]
*  and he's doing it on purpose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=210.82s)]
*  He's trying to intimidate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=213.22s)]
*  And it's interesting to me that this happened when it did, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=214.98s)]
*  because as you may know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=220.5s)]
*  we fight a lawsuit against numerous parties, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=223.14s)]
*  CNN, Politico, but one of the parties is Hunter Biden. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=226.46s)]
*  It was very difficult to find where he was. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=230.9s)]
*  He was in DC for a couple of weeks and he was moving around. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=234.9s)]
*  Well, we finally tracked him down [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  and we were able to serve him last week. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=242.02s)]
*  And now all of a sudden we see this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=244.9s)]
*  when there was always talk of, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=249.78s)]
*  oh, Hunter's going on the offensive, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=254.34s)]
*  he's going after Rudy, he's going after all this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=257.18s)]
*  Never a mention of John Paul. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=259.46s)]
*  And then all of a sudden two of the letters, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=261.42s)]
*  the primary, most of the paragraphs, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=263.98s)]
*  most of the description in the letters are John Paul. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  Right, well, right, always pick the poorest guy to destroy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=269.46s)]
*  Uday and Kusay drive into you drunk [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=272.74s)]
*  and you're the one who gets punished for it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  Godspeed to you both, I appreciate it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  John Paul MacIsaac and Brian Dillerocca, thank you both. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=279.58s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on this show. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbSswA4RyRc&t=286.26s)]
