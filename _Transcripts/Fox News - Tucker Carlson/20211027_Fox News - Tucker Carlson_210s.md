# PETA executive calls for Dr. Fauci's resignation
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI)
*  Well, a nonprofit organization called the White Coat Waste Project has just found that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=0.0s)]
*  a lab in Tunisia, North Africa, infected dozens of beagles with disease-causing parasites. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=4.36s)]
*  This research was funded by Tony Fauci's NIH, which sent a $375,000 grant to the lab. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=11.46s)]
*  Now, according to this nonprofit, the money went to, quote, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=17.92s)]
*  "...drugging beagles locking their heads in mesh cages filled with hungry sandflies [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=21.02s)]
*  so that the insects could eat them alive." [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  That's disgusting, and the people who funded it should be submitted to that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=28.88s)]
*  See how they like it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=32.92s)]
*  By the way, the Washington Post today defended it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=33.92s)]
*  A man, a columnist there called Dana Milbank, will defend literally anything. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=36.28s)]
*  Apparently his lot came up, but it was his job to take one for the team. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=39.8s)]
*  So he wrote a straight-faced piece saying, complaining about this is somehow immoral. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=42.56s)]
*  They'll defend anything. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=46.64s)]
*  Kathy Guillermo is senior vice president at PETA. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Kathy, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  Look, this is so offensive that it's hard even to talk about it on TV. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=53.96s)]
*  But I want to leave open the possibility that maybe there's some reason that we had to torture dogs to death. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=57.96s)]
*  Give us your view. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  There's no reason for the disgrace that this experiment is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=65.72s)]
*  And unfortunately, it's just the tip of the iceberg of what's going on at NIH. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=69.76s)]
*  NIH buys thousands of dogs. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=74.44s)]
*  They subject them to experiments that only Freddy Krueger could think up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=76.68s)]
*  And all of this has to change. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=80.68s)]
*  The last time I was on here with you, I said that NIH director Francis Collins needs to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=82.68s)]
*  go. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=87.76s)]
*  And fortunately, since then, he's announced his resignation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=88.76s)]
*  Now the rest of the NIH directors need to go, too. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=95.12s)]
*  My sense from reading a lot about this is that many of these torture sessions, they're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  not even experiments. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  It's just torturing animals who love us and can't help themselves. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  This is driven by funding. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=109.04s)]
*  So there's money available. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=110.42s)]
*  So the experiment takes place. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=111.42s)]
*  But it doesn't necessarily help science or any people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  They need to spend the money. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=116.48s)]
*  That's what we know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=118.72s)]
*  And they spend about $19 billion of it every year on animal experiments, even though we [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=119.72s)]
*  know that these experiments are not going to find cures and treatments for human beings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=123.76s)]
*  And if you look at their other laboratories, right inside NIH's laboratory in Maryland, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=129.36s)]
*  experimenter Elizabeth Murray, as we exposed last year, brain damages monkeys and then [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=134.36s)]
*  tries to frighten them in tiny cages with plastic snakes and spiders. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=139.5s)]
*  This kind of experimentation goes on all the time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  If you look at the Primate Center at University of Washington, they're full body irradiating [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=146.32s)]
*  monkeys destroying their immune system completely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=150.92s)]
*  And we're all paying for this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=154.04s)]
*  There's no reason to do it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=155.6s)]
*  It needs to stop. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=156.6s)]
*  I feel sick just hearing these stories. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Why would anybody, you see people reflexively defend this stuff. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's science. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=164.56s)]
*  It's cruelty. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=165.56s)]
*  It's not science. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=166.56s)]
*  But why would anyone defend this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=167.56s)]
*  Defending the status quo seems to be the default position of some people, unfortunately. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=170.16s)]
*  But that's not how we progress as a society. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=174.56s)]
*  And we have to get NIH to come to terms with this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=177.2s)]
*  And remember that their constituency is not the animal experimenters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=179.76s)]
*  NIH's constituency is the American public. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=183.6s)]
*  Defending the status quo seems to be the default position for a lot of people, boy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=187.76s)]
*  I don't think I could have put it better than that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=190.88s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=192.96s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=193.96s)]
*  Cathy Guillermo. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=194.96s)]
*  Peter, thank you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=195.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=197.38s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-igXDyuNkI&t=198.38s)]
