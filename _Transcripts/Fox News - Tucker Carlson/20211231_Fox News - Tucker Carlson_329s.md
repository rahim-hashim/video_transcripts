# Conservative was allegedly denied a mortgage due to political views
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis)
*  Discriminating against someone for their political views is already legal in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=0.0s)]
*  You can get kicked off of Twitter and Facebook for being a conservative. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  You can be banned from payment processing platforms like WePay and blocked from raising [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=8.34s)]
*  money on GoFundMe. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=12.34s)]
*  You can even be removed from the internet like we saw with Parler. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=13.92s)]
*  So what's the next step for political discrimination in this country? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=17.54s)]
*  So if Canada is any indication of what's next, it's being denied mortgages for your political [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=21.56s)]
*  views. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=26.7s)]
*  It's just about the nature of the business altogether. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=27.7s)]
*  Because the bank has been, I'll be blunt with you, the bank has been, you know, trying to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=31.54s)]
*  pry away from certain, you know, clients where they're kind of out there in the media and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=37.92s)]
*  very strong opinionated, you know, which is your business in a way. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=45.66s)]
*  So we're just clearing some internal hurdles to make sure that the bank is OK to that kind [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=50.3s)]
*  of onboard you as a client internally. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=58.82s)]
*  Spoiler alert, we did not clear those hurdles, even though I've done all of my personal banking [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=61.06s)]
*  at that same Royal Bank branch for decades. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=66.14s)]
*  Ezra Levant is the man you just saw on that clip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  He was speaking to a banker from the Royal Bank of Canada. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=73.1s)]
*  He is the founder of Rebel News and says he was denied a mortgage because of his conservative [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=75.66s)]
*  views. Ezra Levant joins us now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=80.02s)]
*  So, Ezra, in the video clip we played, it wasn't quite clear if you were being denied [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=82.42s)]
*  because of your political views or if it's just because you're a media personality who has a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=88.26s)]
*  public presence. What was it? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=92.3s)]
*  It was very clearly our views. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=95.98s)]
*  I had several discussions with that mortgage officer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=98.1s)]
*  I just want to make it clear that our mortgage application was financially sound. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  If he would have said it wasn't financially sound, I probably would have believed him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  But he was candid with me. I call him a sort of whistleblower. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=113.22s)]
*  He said it was our opinions because Rebel News, the news site that I run, has conservative [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=116.26s)]
*  opinions. And the Royal Bank is Canada's largest bank. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=121.5s)]
*  I should say they do a lot of business in communist China. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=125.14s)]
*  And I wonder if they have brought some of that social credit approach that they have to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=128.1s)]
*  use in China to Canada. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=132.62s)]
*  And by the way, they have thousands of clients in the United States, too. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=135.62s)]
*  And discriminating against people based on inappropriate grounds, if you're a bank, is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=139.78s)]
*  called redlining. And that's illegal in the States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  I only caught this because this banker at the local branch really wanted to give me the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=148.22s)]
*  mortgage. He said he was fighting against the head office and that it was the head office [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=152.94s)]
*  that vetoed this mortgage application. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=157.7s)]
*  I think social credit, as they call it in China or cancel culture, is here in North [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  America. Banks in America, too. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=164.98s)]
*  Remember, Royal Bank is in America as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  So I don't know if you know this, Ezra, but I was on the financial services committee [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=169.78s)]
*  when I was in Congress and under the Obama era, they had a program called Operation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=172.34s)]
*  Choke Point, where the federal regulators, the FDIC, would put pressure on banks to stop [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=176.18s)]
*  banking gun dealers, smoke shops, small dollar lenders. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=181.34s)]
*  And in essence, if you can't bank, and you know this as well, if you can't bank, if you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  can't cash checks, if you can't process credit card payments, you can't do business in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=188.66s)]
*  America. So the power of banking to just live your life is incredibly powerful if you [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  can't access it, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=197.77999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And in Canada, we have far fewer banks and they have much more power. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  The Royal Bank is the largest bank in Canada. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=204.94s)]
*  I should tell you, there's a revolving door between Justin Trudeau's liberals and the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  Royal Bank. Trudeau's first ambassador to China was a senior RBC bank executive. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=211.3s)]
*  He was awful, by the way. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=217.3s)]
*  Trudeau disappointed another RBC executive to the Senate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  So I think it's a political I scratch your back, you scratch mine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=222.58s)]
*  Rebel News is hated by Justin Trudeau. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=227.18s)]
*  We're one of the few conservative media in this country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=229.62s)]
*  Trudeau's made that clear. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=232.58s)]
*  It wouldn't surprise me if the bank was doing him a favor, considering how many favors [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=233.94s)]
*  he does them. They received, you know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=238.9s)]
*  Canadian banks received enormous bailouts over the years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=241.14s)]
*  They get tremendous privileges, even more than U.S. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  banks get. And I think this is a political quid pro quo. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=248.26s)]
*  You don't want your banks to have a political criteria when it comes to mortgages. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=251.42s)]
*  I mean, really, even convicted murderers when they get out of jail are allowed to get a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=256.5s)]
*  bank account. Imagine punishing conservatives and de platforming them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=261.3s)]
*  I think this is a scandal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=266.5s)]
*  I only found out about it by accident because I had an honest local banker. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=268.18s)]
*  I bet you this is more prevalent than we think. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=272.7s)]
*  I and how would you know if they never actually had a whistleblower tell you? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=275.38s)]
*  As we're 100 percent right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=281.5s)]
*  But what's interesting with banking is that they need the government. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=283.02s)]
*  So in the states, banks have FDIC insurance. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=286.18s)]
*  Right. So if banks want to be political, well, politics can be political as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=289.42s)]
*  And if you want to take away woke banks, FDIC insurance or you can take away their [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  charter, their charter by the federal government or by a state government. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  Those are all tools that conservatives have when they get into leadership to address [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=301.14000000000004s)]
*  this woke ism that's happening in the banking industry. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  We're going to continue to follow this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=308.18s)]
*  It is going to be, I think, an increasing phenomenon across the country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=309.5s)]
*  So, as well, thanks for joining me tonight. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqiPJTgYis&t=313.14000000000004s)]
