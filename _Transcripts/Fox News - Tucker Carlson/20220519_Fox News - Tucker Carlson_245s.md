# Delaware state Democrats draft bill allowing minors secret 'gender transition services'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM)
*  So you've seen this before, you're going to see it again all across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=0.0s)]
*  So legislation pending in the state house in Delaware would allow children to get abortions [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=4.16s)]
*  or sex changes without notifying their parents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  So their parents insurance would pay for this, but the parents don't have a right to know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=15.68s)]
*  Democrats back this bill of course and say flat out abortion and gender transition related [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=20.88s)]
*  services are covered. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=25.36s)]
*  So your kids can have abortions and sex changes and democratic politicians in Delaware and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=27.8s)]
*  many other states don't want you to know about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=35.0s)]
*  So if there was ever an effort to destroy the nuclear family this obvious, we're not [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  aware of what it might be. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=44.2s)]
*  Terry Schilling is the president of the American Principles Project and joins us tonight to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=45.56s)]
*  assess. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=49.84s)]
*  Terry, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=50.84s)]
*  You know, the parents relationship with his or her children is sacrosanct. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=54.24s)]
*  Politicians aren't allowed to get in the middle of that, you would think, and yet Democrats [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  in Delaware and many other states are trying to destroy that relationship. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  Who's fighting back against this? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=69.12s)]
*  Well, there are parents primarily that are fighting back against this, Tucker, and they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=71.08s)]
*  being organized primarily at the local level. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=76.04s)]
*  There are efforts at the national level. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=78.72s)]
*  My organization, American Principles Project, is building what we call the NRA for families, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=80.8s)]
*  but ultimately this is going to be about parents taking back control of their kids' education [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=85.24s)]
*  directly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  We have to make these people pay a political price when they hurt our families. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=92.24s)]
*  Tucker, you said it best. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=96.16s)]
*  This is really about abolishing the family. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=97.9s)]
*  The progressives would say that they're liberating children from the parental constraints and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=100.64s)]
*  the parental oppression and the patriarchy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=106.32s)]
*  Really they're destroying them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=109.2s)]
*  Their goal is to liberate these children, to achieve full equity and full equality, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=111.0s)]
*  and they will achieve that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=115.88s)]
*  We'll just all be equally miserable and terrible and sad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=117.08s)]
*  It'll destroy the country, it'll destroy the economy, and it'll destroy us as individuals [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=122.2s)]
*  if we allow these states to do this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=126.2s)]
*  And it's really important, Tucker, to pay attention to Delaware. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  They are on the cutting edge. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=132.08s)]
*  They were the first state in the nation to codify Roe. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=133.9s)]
*  They were the first state in the nation to redefine parenthood. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=136.44s)]
*  That was in 2009, well before gay marriage passed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=138.84s)]
*  So we have to pay attention because what happens in Delaware ends up spreading to a lot of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  other states. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=145.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they hate their fathers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=146.84s)]
*  That's the basis of their politics. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=149.76s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=151.16s)]
*  But that does not give them a right to mess with our kids. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=152.16s)]
*  They always want to mess with your kids. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=156.08s)]
*  Why not pick on adults? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=158.4s)]
*  Why do they have to take your children, brainwash them, cancel your family ties to your own [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=160.1s)]
*  kids, your parental authority? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Why can't we just draw a line in our children, I wonder? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=168.44s)]
*  Well it's because children are very vulnerable to ideas, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=170.92s)]
*  If you look at the ecosystem that the progressives have created, it's a full-fledged ecosystem. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=174.64s)]
*  The story is much bigger than just what the legislation will do to insurance companies [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=181.64s)]
*  and the explanation of benefits. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  What no one's talking about is that these schools in Delaware all have school-based [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=187.66s)]
*  health clinics. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  And when parents sign out, they sign those permission slips in the beginning of the year, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=193.06s)]
*  they're signing away a bunch of consent forms. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=197.52s)]
*  They sign a consent form that allows these school-based health clinics to treat their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=198.52s)]
*  children and they give away their rights to stop them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  I think most parents think it's going to be ibuprofen or anything like that, but it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=207.44s)]
*  much worse. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  But kids are susceptible to these ideas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=212.84s)]
*  Especially these little kids with the sex ed classes and the gender identity classes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=215.4s)]
*  They still believe in Santa Claus, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  More than a million Americans have pulled their kids out of public schools in the last [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=223.04s)]
*  year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  There's going to be a collapse of schools. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  People are running away from this stuff. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  It's too scary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  It's too threatening. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  And I appreciate the work that you're doing on this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Terry, thanks so much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2QzV473sM&t=233.95999999999998s)]
