# Tucker: Biden has no answers
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight in less than an hour, Joe Biden begins his annual State of the Union address. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Imagine if he dared to be honest about it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  What would he say? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=9.88s)]
*  What is the state of our union tonight? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=11.14s)]
*  Well, in a word, it is fragile, very fragile. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  The United States is poorer, it's more fearful, it's far less free than it was when Joe Biden [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=15.92s)]
*  became the president just 13 months ago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=20.78s)]
*  Joe Biden inherited a divided country, a very divided country, and then he proceeded to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=23.44s)]
*  make it much angrier. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=27.48s)]
*  The U.S. will judge Joe Biden for that, but in the meantime, voters already are. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=29.68s)]
*  Biden's poll numbers have dropped to the point that it's impossible to explain them without [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=33.58s)]
*  admitting that you're at fault. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=37.44s)]
*  It's not just unvaxxed Confederate QAnon seditionists who disapprove of Joe Biden at this point, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=39.1s)]
*  much as the White House suggests otherwise. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=44.08s)]
*  It's pretty much everyone who lives here, apart from the bitter 50-something-year-old [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=46.18s)]
*  wives of private equity barons. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  They're skiing an aspen right now and they still love Biden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  But everyone else has second thoughts, and that would include many Americans who once [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=54.32s)]
*  supported Joe Biden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  It would include Hispanic voters, independent voters, an awful lot of black men. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  At this point, disliking Joe Biden, disapproving of his performance, may be the single thing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=63.12s)]
*  that unites this country. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=68.8s)]
*  It is a rainbow coalition of disdain. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=70.88s)]
*  So that's what Biden is up against tonight. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=74.16s)]
*  The question is, how does he explain his failures? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=76.36s)]
*  And the answer is mostly, he doesn't. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=79.08s)]
*  Biden is guaranteed to make sympathetic noises about inflation and gas prices. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=81.96s)]
*  He has no choice but to do that, but he also has no answers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=85.96s)]
*  He cannot fix the problems that he has caused. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=89.7s)]
*  Thankfully, from his perspective, and we're preparing you, this is very cynical, Biden [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=92.7s)]
*  now has a war to talk about. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=96.78s)]
*  And of course, that's what he will do tonight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=98.82s)]
*  The White House understands the invasion of Ukraine is a chance to change the subject. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=101.06s)]
*  It is what Bloomberg News described today as a political reset. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=104.78s)]
*  So forget what Biden did to your country and your economy and your children's school. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=108.98s)]
*  Joe Biden is Winston Churchill now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=113.56s)]
*  And by the way, Vladimir Putin is the one who's brain damaged. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=115.36s)]
*  The CIA can prove it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=118.2s)]
*  We're about to hear a lot of that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=120.68s)]
*  How much of it can you believe? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=122.44s)]
*  Well some of it, some of it is true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=124.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin really did invade Ukraine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=126.92s)]
*  That really is bad. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=129.04s)]
*  They're not just saying it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=130.4s)]
*  Putin's invasion destabilizes Europe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=131.84s)]
*  Thanks to the recklessness of our leaders, we could wind up at war with Russia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=134.36s)]
*  And that would be a legitimate disaster, no matter what the outcome might be. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=138.04s)]
*  So that's what we know for certain. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=142.48s)]
*  But beyond that, in the realm of any other detail, our advice is be very wary of what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=144.44s)]
*  you hear. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=149.74s)]
*  There is an awful lot of lying going on, an unprecedented amount of lying. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=151.04s)]
*  This war is a humanitarian tragedy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=156.88s)]
*  That we know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=159.52s)]
*  But the war is also a political event that various groups, including in this country, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=160.76s)]
*  are leveraging feverishly in the hope of gaining more power for themselves. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=165.28s)]
*  That is real. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=169.42s)]
*  So to gain that power, they're manipulating you, the consumer of news, and they're doing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=171.36s)]
*  it in ways that are often hidden and therefore highly insidious, and we would say immoral. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  Much of the information about the war that you're ingesting uncritically has in fact [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  been curated by the tech monopolies and yes, by the intel agencies, by the time it reaches [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  your iPhone. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  Some of that information to restate is entirely real. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  Some of it is fake. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=193.36s)]
*  So the question is how do you know the difference? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=195.36s)]
*  How do you know when you're being manipulated? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  As you certainly are. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy8NwzqTeA&t=199.24s)]
