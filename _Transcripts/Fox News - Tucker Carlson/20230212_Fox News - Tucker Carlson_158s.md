# 'Pro-life Spiderman' shares why he scaled 40-story Chase Tower
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU)
*  The so-called pro-life Spider-Man, Mason Deschamps, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=0.0s)]
*  just completed his most daring climb yet. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=3.16s)]
*  We are mesmerized by these, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=5.48s)]
*  and they're legitimately dangerous. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=6.72s)]
*  On Tuesday morning, he free climbed, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=8.28s)]
*  in other words, without ropes, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=9.92s)]
*  the tallest building in Arizona, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=11.18s)]
*  the 40-story Chase Tower in downtown Phoenix. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=12.82s)]
*  The climb received much more media attention [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=15.8s)]
*  than many of his other climbs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=17.92s)]
*  He was arrested after getting the top, as he often is, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=19.76s)]
*  but he's out of jail now, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=22.28s)]
*  and he joins us to explain why he once again risked his life. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=23.36s)]
*  Mason Deschamps is the pro-life Spider-Man. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Great to see you, Mason. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=29.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming on, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=29.84s)]
*  saying congratulations on surviving yet another. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=30.66s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=34.2s)]
*  Tell us why you did this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=35.36s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Tucker. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=38.24s)]
*  I climb these buildings because I want to show people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=39.84s)]
*  how to have faith over fear. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=43.24s)]
*  Abortion is murder, and that's the truth. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Yet so many people my age are scared to speak the truth. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=48.86s)]
*  They're scared to offend, they're scared to lose friends, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=52.56s)]
*  but we can't be scared. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=55.58s)]
*  Abortion is just like climbing a skyscraper. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=57.92s)]
*  It's a matter of life or death, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=60.54s)]
*  and we don't have time for fear. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=62.46s)]
*  That's why this time around, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=64.56s)]
*  I'm raising money for a woman named Hope. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=66.04s)]
*  She's 22 weeks pregnant, and she is partially disabled, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  and I want to show her [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=71.16s)]
*  that she doesn't need to have an abortion, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=72.56s)]
*  and she doesn't need to live in fear. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=74.12s)]
*  Did you raise money by doing this? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I raise money every time, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  especially by coming on your show, Tucker. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=81.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's just such an amazing story, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=84.64s)]
*  because on the one hand, your athletic ability [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=86.6s)]
*  and your bravery is just remarkable, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  and the fact that you're doing it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=90.88s)]
*  in support of the single most unfashionable position [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  in the United States of America, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=95.8s)]
*  and you don't care, is even more inspiring, I would say. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=97.88s)]
*  Have you talked to Hope? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=101.56s)]
*  I have personally not talked to Hope. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=104.08s)]
*  She works with counselors, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=105.96s)]
*  but I'm praying every day for her [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  that she can receive the help and care, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=109.6s)]
*  and I know that what I do is risky, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=111.72s)]
*  and I know what I do is dangerous, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  but it's something that needs to be done, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  and like I say, not everybody can climb a skyscraper, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=119.76s)]
*  but everyone can speak out, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=125.14000000000001s)]
*  and everyone can help save a baby at a time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=126.56s)]
*  by going to letthemlive.org and helping Hope [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=129.12s)]
*  receive the support and care that she needs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=132.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, raising money for a woman who's pregnant [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=135.52s)]
*  and doesn't want to be, and you're trying to help her, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=138.28s)]
*  I can't imagine anything more virtuous than that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  You'll be attacked, but not in my house. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=142.72s)]
*  Mason Deshaun, great to see you, thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=145.44s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tucker. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=146.72s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcsLcZicIU&t=148.16s)]
