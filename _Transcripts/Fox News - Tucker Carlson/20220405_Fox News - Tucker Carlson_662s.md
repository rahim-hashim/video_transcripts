# Tucker: Democrats have decided to replace Biden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight is hard to remember now [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=2.4s)]
*  because history is pretty hazy, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=3.84s)]
*  but it was just three years ago [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=5.16s)]
*  that Joe Biden was considered too decrepit, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  too corrupt, too out of touch ever to be president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=9.56s)]
*  And that wasn't just the view from the right, by the way. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  They mostly stayed out of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  That's what faithful Democrats were saying. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=16.92s)]
*  In 2019, three separate neoliberal news outlets, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  The Guardian, The Week, and CNN, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  all published op-eds with the exact same headline, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=25.72s)]
*  Why Joe Biden Shouldn't Run for President. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=28.84s)]
*  Other publications made the same point with equal vehemence. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=31.96s)]
*  I really look like Joe Biden, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=34.84s)]
*  but he shouldn't run for president, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=36.4s)]
*  said a columnist for USA Today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=38.24s)]
*  Joe Biden is not helping, declared Rolling Stone, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=40.16s)]
*  as if the goal was to help. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=42.72s)]
*  And actually, Biden's family agreed with this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=44.8s)]
*  This is true. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=47.04s)]
*  They did not want him to be president either. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Some of Biden's closest relatives assured friends [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=49.44s)]
*  that Biden was running merely to work off the grief [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=52.16s)]
*  from his son's death two years before. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=54.72s)]
*  It made a kind of sense. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=56.8s)]
*  He needed to get out on the road and clear his head, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=58.04s)]
*  and a campaign was the way to do that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=60.0s)]
*  He knew he wasn't gonna win. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=61.28s)]
*  And for months, it seemed all but assured [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=63.36s)]
*  that he wouldn't win. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=65.4s)]
*  Biden's first debate performance in June [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=66.52s)]
*  was widely written off as a disaster. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=68.36s)]
*  It seemed pretty obvious he had zero chance [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=70.34s)]
*  of the nomination. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=72.24s)]
*  And then Bernie Sanders started to win primaries. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=73.72s)]
*  For the second presidential cycle in a row, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Sanders proved to be the only Democrat in the field [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=79.72s)]
*  with legitimate grassroots support. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=82.6s)]
*  Donors saw this, and they panicked. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=85.2s)]
*  The guy who hates billionaires? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=86.6s)]
*  What's he gonna do to Wall Street? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=87.96s)]
*  So Sanders was unacceptable to the people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=90.16s)]
*  who fund the Democratic Party, but there was a problem. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=92.44s)]
*  What were the options? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=96.5s)]
*  No, both had turned out to be lighter than air. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=98.72s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren? Double no. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=101.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris was horrible on every level. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=104.0s)]
*  Absolutely nobody liked Kamala Harris, and for good reason. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  So it turned out to be Joe Biden by default. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=109.96s)]
*  Get out the Biden signs, we're all in! [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=112.36s)]
*  And of course, the media got the message immediately. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=115.0s)]
*  By the time he was inaugurated, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  here's what the press corps was telling you about Joe Biden. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=118.6s)]
*  Anybody who has any connection to reality [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=122.36s)]
*  about what is going on around them [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=127.52s)]
*  should have watched that and said, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=129.56s)]
*  the adults are back in the room. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=131.76s)]
*  It seems as though we have a professional adult, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=133.72s)]
*  once again, in the White House, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=136.88s)]
*  who's just simply doing the work. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=138.68s)]
*  Really, the theme, I would say, is the adults are back. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=140.88s)]
*  Still, it is a relief to have adults in charge. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=144.12s)]
*  Now we have adults in the White House. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, the adults are back in the room. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=150.0s)]
*  There is a sense, I think, the world over [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=152.6s)]
*  that the adults have returned. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=154.96s)]
*  We have an adult in the White House now, and it's glorious. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=157.0s)]
*  These people, never an original thought among them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  He's an adult, it's glorious! [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, half true, Biden is certainly an adult. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=169.32s)]
*  He'll be 80 this fall. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=171.44s)]
*  But no one in Washington thinks [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=173.56s)]
*  the Biden presidency is glorious anymore. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=174.96s)]
*  They think it's a disaster. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Polls show that voters strongly agree. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=179.28s)]
*  Joe Biden is now the most unpopular person [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=181.72s)]
*  in virtually any room he enters. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=184.08s)]
*  If you doubt it, watch this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=186.36s)]
*  This was the scene at the White House today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=187.48s)]
*  Take a careful look at this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=189.72s)]
*  You've never seen anything like it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=190.96s)]
*  That's the President of the United States in his own house, shunned. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=203.56s)]
*  Nobody would talk to him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=208.76s)]
*  So Biden wandered off looking vacant [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=210.36s)]
*  as a crowd formed around a former president, Barack Obama, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=212.28s)]
*  who was obviously deeply grateful for the attention. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=214.96s)]
*  And then it got worse. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=217.36s)]
*  It got much more poignant than that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=218.36s)]
*  Watch Biden try to horn in on the conversation [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=220.16s)]
*  swirling around Obama. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=222.56s)]
*  Everyone involved in that conversation, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=224.56s)]
*  including Kamala Harris, who supposedly works for Biden, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=226.36s)]
*  ignored Biden completely. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=228.76s)]
*  Biden desperately tried to get Obama's attention. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=231.16s)]
*  He puts his hand on Obama's shoulder. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=233.16s)]
*  He even calls him Barack, like they're friends. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  But Obama blows him off. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=238.16s)]
*  He acts like Biden's not even there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=240.16s)]
*  Ask yourself if you have ever in your life [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  seen anything sadder than this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=244.56s)]
*  Oh, make it stop. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=260.76s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=261.76s)]
*  Now, it's true that Barack Obama has never liked Joe Biden. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=263.76s)]
*  For the eight years they worked together, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=266.36s)]
*  Obama mocked him relentlessly as an old white guy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=267.76s)]
*  He did his best to keep Biden at the periphery. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=270.56s)]
*  That's why he got the Ukraine account, faithfully. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=272.56s)]
*  But even someone as arrogant as Barack Obama [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=275.56s)]
*  is a true hero. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=278.56s)]
*  He's a hero. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=280.56s)]
*  He's a hero. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=282.56s)]
*  He's a hero. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=284.56s)]
*  He's a hero. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=286.56s)]
*  He's a hero. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=288.56s)]
*  Barack Obama can pretend if he has to pretend. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=290.56s)]
*  And that's the point of the video we just showed you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=293.56s)]
*  Obama no longer has to pretend. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=295.56s)]
*  He can tell the world in the clearest possible terms [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=299.56s)]
*  that he has no respect for Joe Biden [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=301.56s)]
*  because at this point nobody has respect for Joe Biden. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=304.56s)]
*  Even Biden's most faithful supporters in the press corps [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=306.56s)]
*  have turned on him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=309.56s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=310.56s)]
*  Inflation is erasing bigger paychecks. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=320.56s)]
*  While hourly earnings are up 5.6% over last year, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=323.56s)]
*  nearly one in five workers says they run out of money [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=326.56s)]
*  before they get their next check. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=329.56s)]
*  You have historic inflation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=331.56s)]
*  You have record gas prices. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=333.56s)]
*  Americans are feeling it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=334.56s)]
*  Biden's numbers have dropped by double digits with young voters [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=336.56s)]
*  and they were a big part of his coalition in 2020. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=339.56s)]
*  Voter anxiety is about more than rising prices [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=343.56s)]
*  or Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=346.56s)]
*  Violent crime in American cities remains persistently high [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=348.56s)]
*  and there is a growing problem at the border. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=353.56s)]
*  President Biden's approval rating still hasn't found bottom [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=355.56s)]
*  and it's been slowly trending down all year. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=359.56s)]
*  Oh, wait a second. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=362.56s)]
*  Correction, breaking news. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=364.56s)]
*  It looks like inflation is real. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=365.56s)]
*  It's not transitory. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=368.56s)]
*  It's actually making us poor. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=369.56s)]
*  Crime and disorder in the cities are real too. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=372.56s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=374.56s)]
*  It looks like a totally pointless war with Russia [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=375.56s)]
*  is not as popular as we thought it was. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=378.56s)]
*  You're not a traitor for not wanting it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=381.56s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're admitting all of this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=384.56s)]
*  For months, Biden's been telling us that every bad thing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=386.56s)]
*  you notice around you is, of course, Vladimir Putin's fault [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=389.56s)]
*  and the media have backed him up. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=392.56s)]
*  But suddenly, they aren't backing him up anymore. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=394.56s)]
*  Ready to be shocked again? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=397.56s)]
*  Watch a group of liberal toadies [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=399.56s)]
*  demolish the Biden White House's favorite talking point. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=401.56s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=404.56s)]
*  And every time we talk about gas prices, Democrats do. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=405.56s)]
*  President Biden does. It's always Putin's price hike. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=408.56s)]
*  They're trying to blame, of course, the Russian president [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=410.56s)]
*  and the invasion of Ukraine for the jump in prices. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=412.56s)]
*  But of course, as polling suggests, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=416.56s)]
*  this president is going to take a lot of the blame here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=418.56s)]
*  Biden has called it a Putin price hike, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=420.56s)]
*  but most Americans aren't buying it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=422.56s)]
*  With the midterms now just a few months away [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=424.56s)]
*  and inflation at a record high, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=426.56s)]
*  the president is now putting the blame squarely on Vladimir Putin [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=428.56s)]
*  calling this the Putin price hike. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=430.56s)]
*  But as Republicans and the president's critics have been quick to note, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=432.56s)]
*  gas prices were already rising before Russia started this war. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=434.56s)]
*  The White House is trying to do both. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=438.56s)]
*  Blame Putin, blame the oil and gas companies, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=442.56s)]
*  but Americans just don't agree. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=445.56s)]
*  What? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=447.56s)]
*  Now they tell us. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=450.56s)]
*  Is your head spinning yet? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=451.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=453.56s)]
*  Okay, just one more. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=454.56s)]
*  Here's Sandy Cortez, who has finally turned on Joe Biden. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=456.56s)]
*  Now it was just a year and a half ago [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=460.56s)]
*  that Sandy's job was to use all the street cred [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=462.56s)]
*  she'd earned growing up in the leafy suburbs of Westchester [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=464.56s)]
*  and then heading off to Boston University [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=467.56s)]
*  to use all of that urban credibility [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=469.56s)]
*  to convince the young people that actually Joe Biden was okay. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=472.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's old and white, but go ahead and vote for him anyway. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=476.56s)]
*  He's got Sandy's seal of approval. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=479.56s)]
*  Selling Joe Biden was her job, and of course she did it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=482.56s)]
*  She's always been much more a dutiful party [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=484.56s)]
*  apparatchik than a revolutionary. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=486.56s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=488.56s)]
*  Sandy Cortez sees change coming. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=490.56s)]
*  If there's one thing she's good at, it's knowing the prevailing wind. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=492.56s)]
*  So she's happy to attack Biden. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=496.56s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=498.56s)]
*  We need to acknowledge that this isn't just about middle of the road, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=499.56s)]
*  an increasingly narrow band of independent voters. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=503.56s)]
*  But this is really about the collapse and support among young people, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=508.56s)]
*  among the Democratic base, feeling like they are not, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=512.56s)]
*  that they worked overtime to get this president elected [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=515.56s)]
*  and they aren't necessarily being seen. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=518.56s)]
*  Oh, so Sandy's out. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=520.56s)]
*  That means everyone's out. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=522.56s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=524.56s)]
*  Well, exactly what it looks like. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=525.56s)]
*  The Democratic Party and its media wing have decided to jettison Joe Biden. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=527.56s)]
*  There was never an official order to do this. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=531.56s)]
*  What you're watching here, as always, is the hive mind at work. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=533.56s)]
*  Democrats have the same reactions because they have the same instincts. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=537.56s)]
*  Biden is weak. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=540.56s)]
*  We must get rid of him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=541.56s)]
*  Now, to most people, that sounds harsh and unforgiving, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=543.56s)]
*  but in the animal kingdom, it's an entirely natural response. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=546.56s)]
*  It's the first rule of dog packs, for example. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=549.56s)]
*  If a single dog wavers or lags behind, the other dogs will kill him, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=551.56s)]
*  even if they're from the same litter. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=555.56s)]
*  Yes, it's fratricide, but it's nothing personal. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=557.56s)]
*  It's a matter of group survival. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=559.56s)]
*  And that's exactly how the Democratic Party operates. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=561.56s)]
*  Individuals are irrelevant to the party. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=564.56s)]
*  The group is all that matters. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=566.56s)]
*  No one at the DNC actually cares about Joe Biden or ever has, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=568.56s)]
*  or for that matter, cares about George Floyd or Greta Thunberg [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=572.56s)]
*  or David Hogg or anyone else they tell you is an irreplaceable hero. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=575.56s)]
*  All people are expendable. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=579.56s)]
*  What matters is the party, and the party matters because in numbers there is power. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=582.56s)]
*  And of course, on some level, Joe Biden knows this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=587.56s)]
*  He spent his life in the Democratic Party. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=589.56s)]
*  He's never worked outside the Democratic Party, so he understands how this ends. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=591.56s)]
*  Inevitably, after 50 years, it is his turn to be eliminated. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=596.56s)]
*  Will he scream for mercy like Beria did, or will he take it like a man? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=600.56s)]
*  That's the only question. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=604.56s)]
*  Biden can't lead. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=606.56s)]
*  Therefore, at some point soon, he won't be allowed to lead. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=607.56s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=611.56s)]
*  And if you doubt it, watch Biden talk sometime. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=612.56s)]
*  Here's Biden the other day telling us that Jill Biden was, in fact, once Barack Obama's vice president. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=615.56s)]
*  And I'm deeply proud of the work she's doing as First Lady with Joining Forces Initiative. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=621.56s)]
*  She started with Michelle Obama when she was vice president and now carries on. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=627.56s)]
*  You know, it feels mean even to play that, but it's not a unique example. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=634.56s)]
*  We see examples like that every single day, and his fellow Democrats see them too. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=637.56s)]
*  So they've decided to replace Joe Biden, period. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=642.56s)]
*  But how will they do it and who will they replace him with? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=646.56s)]
*  That's what we don't know. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58Bx0Ebppw&t=649.56s)]
