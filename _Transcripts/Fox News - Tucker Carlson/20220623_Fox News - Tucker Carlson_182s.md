# Max Boot is not actually fighting ‘our war’: Tucker Carlson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg)
*  Max Boot was on MSNBC again this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Guess what he was talking about? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Can you guess? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=3.92s)]
*  The one thing that brings joy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=5.0s)]
*  to his stunted and miserable existence, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=6.28s)]
*  and that's war, other people burning each other to death. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=8.08s)]
*  Max Boot announced a new escalation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=11.44s)]
*  in his new favorite war, the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=14.36s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=17.2s)]
*  I think the key here is we have to understand [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=19.04s)]
*  that we're making a mistake [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=22.44s)]
*  in the way that we think about the war, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=23.84s)]
*  because we keep thinking about it as their war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  The Ukrainians are fighting. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=28.16s)]
*  We need to think about it as our war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=30.0s)]
*  We're not providing gray eagle drones [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=32.08s)]
*  that the Ukrainians need. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=34.0s)]
*  We're not providing as many multiple launch rocket systems [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=35.4s)]
*  as they need. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=38.44s)]
*  All of us collectively can be and should be doing more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=39.28s)]
*  because we need to understand this is our fight [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=42.8s)]
*  that the Ukrainians are on the front lines of. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=45.64s)]
*  It's our war. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Hear that, people of Dubuque, Bangor, Gulfport, Spokane? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It's your war, not theirs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  But the weird thing is, despite the fact that it's our war, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=59.0s)]
*  Max Boot is still in the morning Joe's studio [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  wearing soft shoes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=63.68s)]
*  So despite this war's world historic importance [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=65.96s)]
*  and our own personal ownership of it, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=69.0s)]
*  Max Boot is not actually fighting his war. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=71.24s)]
*  Nor, even more strangely, is Max Boot sending his own salary [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=74.84s)]
*  to fund our war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  What he's doing is what he always does, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=79.08s)]
*  which is promoting our war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=80.6s)]
*  And this is hardly the first war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=82.36s)]
*  In Boot's long and not at all varied career [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=84.56s)]
*  he has demanded that American troops go to war [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=86.76s)]
*  in a dizzying variety of countries. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=88.76s)]
*  Boot has called for invasions of Syria, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=90.4s)]
*  invasion of Iran, as well as a hot war against North Korea, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=92.72s)]
*  even a war against Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=95.72s)]
*  Quote, if the US armed forces made such short work [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=97.84s)]
*  of a hardened goon like Saddam Hussein, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  imagine what they could do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=102.4s)]
*  to the soft and sybaritic Saudi royal family. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Boot once wrote, and he was imagining it, in great detail. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  Well, that didn't happen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=110.84s)]
*  We never invaded Mecca, too bad. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=111.68s)]
*  So Max Boot moved on to calling [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=114.12s)]
*  for the military occupation of Pakistan. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=115.68s)]
*  Nuclear on Pakistan, let's occupy it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  And then Somalia, those were our wars, too. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=122.4s)]
*  In 2011, Boot called for a war against Libya, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  and Hillary Clinton actually did it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=128.08s)]
*  And of course, Boot was one of the main cheerleaders [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=129.88s)]
*  for our war against Iraq. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=131.6s)]
*  Quote, once we have deposed Saddam, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=133.4s)]
*  he wrote before the invasion, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=135.96s)]
*  we can impose an American-led international regency [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=137.44s)]
*  in Baghdad to go along with the one in Kabul, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=140.08s)]
*  to turn Iraq into a beacon of hope [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=142.96s)]
*  for the oppressed peoples of the Middle East. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=145.04s)]
*  Now that would be a historic war aim. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=146.76s)]
*  Is this an ambitious agenda? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=149.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=151.0s)]
*  Does America have the resources to carry it out? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=152.12s)]
*  Also, without a doubt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=154.6s)]
*  Sure, we can afford it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=157.12s)]
*  It'll be easy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=159.28s)]
*  Now, trillions of dollars [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=161.0s)]
*  and more than a million dead people later, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  how did Max Boot's prediction work out? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=164.2s)]
*  Don't ask. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  He's got a new war to sell you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  It's our war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4R1TmfDQg&t=170.23999999999998s)]
