# Comedian tells Tucker what a Newsom presidency could look like
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8)
*  But before that happens, we thought we would check in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=0.0s)]
*  on someone who has spent his life in the state [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=2.14s)]
*  and has seen it change longitudinally [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=4.24s)]
*  over more than 50 years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=6.92s)]
*  Adam Kurl is our friend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=8.4s)]
*  He joins us tonight to respond to a potential [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=9.52s)]
*  Gavin Newsom presidential run. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=11.8s)]
*  Adam, he's your governor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=14.44s)]
*  What do you think of this? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=16.48s)]
*  All right, I could barely watch that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=19.76s)]
*  without crawling out of my skin [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=22.22s)]
*  or not being clean and sober. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Okay, couple things. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=26.94s)]
*  He came on my podcast nine years ago [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  and he told me his number one issue was homeless [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=31.68s)]
*  and homelessness, that was his number one issue. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=35.56s)]
*  I said to him, the homeless population, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=38.92s)]
*  this is 10 years ago, is comprised of drug addicts [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=41.76s)]
*  and people with mental disabilities and or both. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=44.96s)]
*  He then said to me, sitting three feet across from me, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=48.32s)]
*  but what about the true face of homelessness, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=52.04s)]
*  which is a mother of three [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=55.16s)]
*  who has a full-time minimum wage job, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  whose husband left her? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  So that was his idea of solving a problem [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=62.16s)]
*  and he declared himself, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=66.32s)]
*  the number one issue is homelessness [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=68.52s)]
*  and that's what he thought homeless was in California. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  Of course, it's grown exponentially [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=75.96s)]
*  and no one has ever seen a mother of three [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  with a full-time job out on the street. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=80.78s)]
*  He's a sociopathic buffoon, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=83.36s)]
*  but the scary part is people vote for him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=86.32s)]
*  It's really you and I, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=89.6s)]
*  we don't need to unsolve the riddle of Gavin Newsom. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=92.12s)]
*  He's a carpet bagger, he's an idiot, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=95.52s)]
*  he's bought and sold, he's a sociopath. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=97.88s)]
*  He puts real cream on his teeth, fine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=100.4s)]
*  Why do people vote for him? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=103.28s)]
*  That's the real question that we need to solve. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=105.64s)]
*  Well, that's the threat to democracy right there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=110.44s)]
*  If you have a population, it's a brand new population, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=113.7s)]
*  a huge percentage of Californians [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  just got there from other countries. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  If you have a population that votes for a leader [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=119.7s)]
*  that makes things worse, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=122.34s)]
*  that is the challenge to democracy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=124.26s)]
*  and make things worse measurably, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=126.3s)]
*  like measurably economically in crime. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=128.3s)]
*  I mean, like that's a huge problem, a scary problem. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=131.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=137.7s)]
*  the great Carroll Shelby, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=139.26s)]
*  the man who made the Shelby Cobra left Texas in the 60s [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=140.74s)]
*  to come to California to build cars. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=145.46s)]
*  Could you imagine leaving Texas and coming to California [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=148.62s)]
*  to manufacture something in 2023? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  Also, here's a thought experiment that I think would work. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=155.46s)]
*  Do you think if a number of Joe Biden's aides said to him, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=159.22s)]
*  you can't run for president, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=164.54000000000002s)]
*  we're already in our second term? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you think he would believe that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's good. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=173.82000000000002s)]
*  I don't run into Biden too often, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=176.34s)]
*  but if I ever see him, I'm gonna say that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, the constitution is one allowed, sir, I'm sorry. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  Adam Carolla. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=181.78s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=183.62s)]
*  That is hilarious. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=184.46s)]
*  Performing in New York in May. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  Good luck there, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgoUsHA3IM8&t=187.82000000000002s)]
