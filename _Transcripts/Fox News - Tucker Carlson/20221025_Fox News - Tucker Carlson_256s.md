# Democratic Party's hypocrisy on display in Congressional Black Caucus
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno)
*  Well, the Congressional Black Caucus says its mission is to quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=0.0s)]
*  we read the website, ensure that African Americans and other marginalized communities in the US [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=3.36s)]
*  have the opportunity to achieve the American dream. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Okay, well that sounds positive. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  But in fact, the Congressional Black Caucus is completely corrupt, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=12.36s)]
*  as everyone who lives in Washington knows. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  But worse than that, it's just a political action committee designed to elect Democrats. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=18.92s)]
*  They don't care about African Americans and marginalized communities, of course. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=22.48s)]
*  And we know that, for many reasons, but here's the latest, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=26.96s)]
*  they are currently backing a white Democrat over Jennifer Ruth Green, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=30.36s)]
*  who's running for Congress in Indiana. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=33.6s)]
*  Jennifer Ruth Green joins us tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=35.64s)]
*  Jennifer Ruth Green, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=38.2s)]
*  Now you would think you're African American, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=40.28s)]
*  the Congressional Black Caucus would be, I guess, on your side. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=42.44s)]
*  It's a race-specific group, but why aren't they backing you? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me, Mr. Carlson. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=52.72s)]
*  The hypocrisy in this decision is so incredibly clear. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=54.6s)]
*  We see that this is about power, and this is about policy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  This is about process. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=62.2s)]
*  This is not about progress. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=63.64s)]
*  These are the liberal elites who want to have power and are focused on retaining it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=65.28s)]
*  And so their decision to back my opponent is hypocritical at best. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=69.68s)]
*  Because largely, when you think about the fact that I understand the black cultural [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=74.12s)]
*  experience better than any white man ever will, I understand the growth that needs to occur. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=78.2s)]
*  I understand what needs to happen, and I'm committed as a black woman and as an [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=83.88s)]
*  Asian American woman to progressing minorities in our country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=87.56s)]
*  I seem like the very clear choice. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=91.0s)]
*  But because they want power over politics, the hypocrisy continues to be loud and proud. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=92.88s)]
*  Well, maybe you know how corrupt they are. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=98.16s)]
*  Maybe that's why they don't want to back you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=102.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think- [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=104.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, go ahead. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  As I'm sitting in our district, we have a third of our people in Gary, Indiana, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  who are sub-poverty level. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=113.72s)]
*  We have a third of the people in Gary, Indiana, who live in food deserts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=115.48s)]
*  And so here are people who are hurting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=119.4s)]
*  And so the economy that Congressman Frank Morvan has voted for has consistently put [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=121.56s)]
*  them in a place where they have to choose between gas and groceries, where Congressman [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Frank Morvan has voted for $3 trillion in spending and has spent their grandkids' money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=130.12s)]
*  And these are African Americans who are clearly hurting, and he has zero regard for them, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=135.24s)]
*  and they are focused on trying, the CBC specifically, focused on trying to continue to elect him [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=140.68s)]
*  because overall they believe he's doing a good job. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=147.0s)]
*  But I can just tell you this, Mr. Carlson, there is a line, a mile and a half long of cars [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=149.72s)]
*  that sit outside my headquarters, people who need to get to the food pantry, who need help. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=155.72s)]
*  And this is the America that the Congressional Black Caucus wants to act as if it is helping [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=161.72s)]
*  black people, and it is very clearly not in Indiana's first congressional district. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=167.16s)]
*  I've been to Gary, Indiana. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=171.32s)]
*  It's one of the toughest places I've ever been in my life in this or any other country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=172.52s)]
*  It's overwhelmingly African American. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=176.12s)]
*  It's really bad, I would say. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=179.16s)]
*  What has the Democratic Party done for Gary, Indiana, ever? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=181.32s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=185.56s)]
*  We have some amazing people that live in Gary, Indiana. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=186.04s)]
*  Yeah, I believe it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=188.6s)]
*  I have some amazing friends, some people that love God, love others, want to serve both. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=189.64s)]
*  And I am proud to have Gary, Indiana in our district. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=193.96s)]
*  But when I think about the reality of people that are hurting because of these economic choices, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=196.68s)]
*  this is a plan that has no action behind it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=201.4s)]
*  The congressman has no plan. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  But if you go to jrg.gop, you will see a plan, a plan to help figure out the economic processes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=206.44s)]
*  that need to move forward. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=212.44s)]
*  And I'm disappointed in the hypocrisy that the Congressional Black Caucus continues to provide [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  because they don't have a plan and they would rather continue to crush people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=219.88s)]
*  because it's all about, again, their power and the liberal elites versus regular America, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=223.8s)]
*  people who want to stay in power, although they are doing absolutely nothing to make progress [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=229.24s)]
*  on the mission that they continue to talk about. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, of course, if they cared, they'd be talking about Gary, Indiana and not Ukraine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=235.08s)]
*  But they don't care. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=238.84s)]
*  That's obvious. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=239.72s)]
*  Jennifer with Green, appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=240.84s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=244.36s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYaigbXRno&t=253.8s)]
