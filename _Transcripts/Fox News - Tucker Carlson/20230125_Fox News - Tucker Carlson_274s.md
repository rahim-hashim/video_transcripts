# Nun tells Tucker how she stopped a burglary
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU)
*  Sister Mary Janice is the director of the Response to Love Center in Buffalo, New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=0.0s)]
*  The center offers hot meals and guidance to the neighborhoods around it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=4.7s)]
*  But on a Saturday morning earlier this month, thieves tried to rob the center. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=7.9s)]
*  You're seeing the footage on your screen right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=12.3s)]
*  So Sister Mary Janice responded immediately. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=14.1s)]
*  She went outside and she saw the thieves setting up a ladder. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=16.8s)]
*  She prayed as she kicked the ladder and the thieves ran away. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=19.6s)]
*  Sister Mary Janice is a nun and a leader at the Response to Love Center. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Needless to say, she's also our employee of the month. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=28.0s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=30.4s)]
*  Sister Janice, we are honored to have you on tonight. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=31.3s)]
*  Your response to this burglary amazes me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=34.6s)]
*  Can you just describe what happened? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=37.6s)]
*  Well, it happened I was tossing with wrestling with God because I wanted to sleep a little longer on Saturday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=40.6s)]
*  But something told me to get up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=48.6s)]
*  So I got up, sat on Green Emerald Island. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=51.3s)]
*  That's my chair where I pray. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=53.8s)]
*  And I sat there for an hour in prayer and I said, I'll go down now, have breakfast with my two sisters, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  walk down the stairs and I heard some noise. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=62.1s)]
*  I thought maybe it's the newspaper or someone driving down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=65.2s)]
*  And I opened up the door and I saw this stepladder and I said, oh, this stepladder doesn't belong here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=69.0s)]
*  No workers here on a Saturday. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=74.7s)]
*  Closed the door again. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=77.0s)]
*  And I thought, I got to move that ladder. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=79.0s)]
*  The light went on when I opened the door and one of the fellas ran away. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=82.6s)]
*  The next one, I looked up, he was on the roof and I said, he's got to come down, but not on this ladder. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=88.1s)]
*  So by the grace of God, grabbed the ladder, threw it down, looked up and the fellow jumped down, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=94.1s)]
*  stood beside me and I said, this is God's property. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  This is God's mission. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=106.8s)]
*  How dare you do this? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  I pointed my finger and I told him, get out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=111.4s)]
*  And he ran away. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  And that's how the story ended. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=116.5s)]
*  But then I wondered, this was God's mission for me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=118.9s)]
*  And there's a lesson in all this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=123.0s)]
*  You know, there was no violence. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=125.4s)]
*  No one was hurt. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=127.5s)]
*  I wasn't hurt. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=129.1s)]
*  And maybe a lesson was to be learned. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=130.5s)]
*  And I think that's what happened. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=132.9s)]
*  Not only for me, not only for them, but I think for the whole world to say, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=134.8s)]
*  you know, there is a God and we're here to protect him and his mission. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=140.9s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=146.9s)]
*  You're an amazing person. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Were you afraid at all? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=150.9s)]
*  No, I wasn't afraid at all because I knew it was something that had to be done. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=153.3s)]
*  You know, we're working in an area that's very poor and I'm no different than anybody who's there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  They're subject to looting, theft, violence. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=166.4s)]
*  And I'm in that neighborhood and I have an identity that I share with my people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=170.0s)]
*  I'm no better and no different. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=174.8s)]
*  I want to be there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=177.0s)]
*  And the building that we're in is special. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=178.8s)]
*  It's a dining room. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=182.8s)]
*  It's a place of safety. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=184.3s)]
*  People coming together, enjoying a meal and just experiencing so much joy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Why would someone want to hurt that mission? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=193.1s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Sister Mary Jeanice, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=197.79999999999998s)]

*  It's just an experience of God. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=204.0s)]
*  It's an experience where God is so present. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=207.2s)]
*  He wants that mission to reach out to poor people, to really share that their loved compassion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=211.9s)]
*  You know, in our building, we don't have a lot of money. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=220.4s)]
*  We raise all the money. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  We do all the service to make it special for people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, I have the feeling this is going to help your fundraising. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=233.1s)]
*  I hope it does. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=235.3s)]
*  And I appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=236.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=237.6s)]
*  You know, God does provide for us, but so many people really join in. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  They help us so beautifully. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=244.5s)]
*  They're always there for us with donations of clothing, donations of food, monetary gifts. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=246.9s)]
*  I believe you are not afraid. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=256.9s)]
*  Sister Mary Jeanice, thank you very much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw0nq_48MFU&t=260.0s)]
