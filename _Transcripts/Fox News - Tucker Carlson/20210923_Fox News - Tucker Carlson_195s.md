# Tucker: Gavin Newsom is overseeing the 'death of suburbs'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo)
*  In addition to all the other problems that California has, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=0.0s)]
*  housing prices there are higher than any place [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=3.58s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=6.36s)]
*  The median home price in the state of California [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=7.2s)]
*  is now more than $800,000. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=9.08s)]
*  That's more than double the nationwide median. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  In recent years, because this really is a problem, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=13.96s)]
*  leaders in California passed dozens of bills [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=16.12s)]
*  they claim would fix the problem. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=18.76s)]
*  Governor Jerry Brown, the last guy, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=20.52s)]
*  signed 15 housing bills just in 2017. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Last year, Gavin Newsom signed 18 separate housing bills. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=26.38s)]
*  Did they work? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=30.58s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  They did not work for the people who live in California, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=33.74s)]
*  but they weren't intended to work [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=36.46s)]
*  for people who wanna buy houses. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=38.36s)]
*  Instead, those bills had one purpose, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=40.72s)]
*  destroying suburban homes [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=43.22s)]
*  and replacing them with high density housing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  Real estate developers make more money [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  when single family homes are leveled [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=50.06s)]
*  and replaced with apartment complexes, obviously. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=51.86s)]
*  And real estate developers happen to be major donors [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=54.86s)]
*  to the Democratic Party of California, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=57.58s)]
*  and in particular to Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=59.5s)]
*  For example, the real estate developer George Marcus [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=61.86s)]
*  was one of Gavin Newsom's biggest donors [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=63.9s)]
*  in the recent recall election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=66.02s)]
*  So this week, after surviving the recall tragically, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=68.34s)]
*  Gavin Newsom rewarded those real estate developers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  with the biggest quote, housing bill ever. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=75.3s)]
*  Newsom just signed a series of bills, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=78.38s)]
*  most notably SB9 and SB10, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=80.26s)]
*  that will abolish the suburbs in the state of California, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=83.02s)]
*  the state that invented the suburbs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  Those bills were endorsed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  by the California Building Industry Association, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  which represents quote, interests of builders [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=93.02s)]
*  and developers of housing and commercial projects. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=95.58s)]
*  There are about to be quite a few new commercial projects [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  in California's suburbs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=101.86s)]
*  As the New York Times put it, quote, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  SB9 essentially ends single family zoning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=105.3s)]
*  Property owners now have the state's approval [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=109.78s)]
*  to convert any single family home in the state of California [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=111.74s)]
*  into a four unit apartment complex. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=114.94s)]
*  How is this improving anyone's life? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=117.38s)]
*  It won't. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=119.46s)]
*  It means demolishing homes to put up rental units. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=121.38s)]
*  At the behest of his donors, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=124.14s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is turning the state of California into a slum. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just happening in California. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  Recently, Oregon passed a statewide ban [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=130.34s)]
*  on single family zoning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=133.94s)]
*  Cities like Minneapolis and Sacramento [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  have begun to allow multifamily dwellings [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=137.1s)]
*  on single family lots. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=139.1s)]
*  Crowding a problem, anyone think? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=141.32s)]
*  Only the government of China, by the way, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  appears to be doing anything [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=146.1s)]
*  to rein in real estate developers. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=147.56s)]
*  Quote, housing should be for living in, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=149.2s)]
*  not for speculation, said the president of China recently. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=151.0s)]
*  We hate to quote the president of China, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=154.04s)]
*  but in this case, he is right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=155.94s)]
*  We know that because we're the largest [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=159.32s)]
*  and most leveraged real estate companies in the world. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=160.56s)]
*  The China-based Evergrande Group is collapsing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=162.62s)]
*  and China has given no indication [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=165.16s)]
*  they're interested in bailing out Evergrande. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=166.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, in this country, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  real estate companies don't just get bailouts, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=170.52s)]
*  they get to write the laws. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  They get to wreck your neighborhood. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=173.8s)]
*  And in many parts of America, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  they'd be able to demolish the home next door [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  and turn it into an apartment complex. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  It's great. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mF-HCjtvTo&t=182.0s)]
