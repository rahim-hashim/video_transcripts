# Mainstream media caught in 'woke stranglehold': Batya Ungar-Sargon
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ)
*  So as we told you many times before, as soon as the economy crashed to the benefit of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  big banks, the New York Times, Washington Post, et cetera, et cetera, started throwing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the word racist around with increasing volume. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=9.84s)]
*  It was almost like they were working on behalf of the oligarchs to divide the rest of us [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=13.68s)]
*  against each other so we wouldn't notice that a small group was getting super, super rich. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=19.64s)]
*  Almost nobody in journalism ever mentions this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=24.28s)]
*  Bachha Ungar Sargon is one of the few who does. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=27.12s)]
*  She just went on CNN over the weekend feeling a little guilty playing a clip from a rival [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=30.36s)]
*  network, but this is just too good to miss. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=33.8s)]
*  Here's how it went. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  The media's response to Youngkin's victory is literally the reason that he won, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=37.8s)]
*  How did they respond? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  There's a hundred medias, a hundred reactions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  You're pretty overly generalizing, I think. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=46.44s)]
*  Let me get more specific for you, okay? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=48.84s)]
*  Because I have to say, I have to admit, having watched CNN all week, there's been a lot of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=50.56s)]
*  very, very, very good genuflection on this front. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  But what happened right after the election was you saw host after host after host on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  MSNBC saying, oh, this is a victory for white supremacy, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  White supremacy wins again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=66.36s)]
*  Racism wins again. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=68.0s)]
*  When the lieutenant governor that Youngkin won with will be the first black woman to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=69.16s)]
*  hold that job. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=73.68s)]
*  When Glenn Youngkin managed to flip majority black districts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Sanypachi Angar Sargan is the deputy opinion editor at Newsweek, also author of the new [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=80.48s)]
*  book, Bad News, How Woke Media is Undermining Democracy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=84.0s)]
*  She joins us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=87.12s)]
*  Sanypachi, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=88.12s)]
*  I'm starting to embarrass you with that clip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=89.12s)]
*  It was just too amusing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=90.72s)]
*  Oh my gosh, Tucker, thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=91.72s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm fair enough. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  So you say it's undermining democracy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  What I think is interesting about your take on it is you take it to, I think, a deeper [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=97.64s)]
*  level. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=100.48s)]
*  It's more than just annoying. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=101.48s)]
*  There's a purpose to all this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=102.48s)]
*  What do you think the purpose is? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=103.48s)]
*  Well, I think you really nailed it in your opening, Tucker. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=105.36s)]
*  You started out by saying that we have this deep class divide in America that separates [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=109.48s)]
*  the people who are really feeling the inflation at the gas pump from the people who live in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=113.92s)]
*  coastal cities who maybe don't drive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=119.28s)]
*  Maybe they take Ubers. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Maybe they take the subway. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And the history of journalism in the 20th century in America is the history of a class [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=124.44s)]
*  of people moving from one of those classes to the other. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=129.08s)]
*  Journalism used to be a working class trade. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=133.8s)]
*  And throughout the 20th century, journalists became part of the American elites. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=136.26s)]
*  And as they did so, they abandoned the working class of all races. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=140.42s)]
*  And what we're seeing now with woke media is just the latest stage of that abandonment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's I've seen it in I've seen it up close. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=148.78s)]
*  I think you're exactly right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  The composition of newsrooms is completely different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=154.18s)]
*  But that's a perversion of the core mission of journalism. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=157.32s)]
*  We always heard when I was 30 years ago when I started, you know, it's to afflict the comfortable [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=160.18s)]
*  and comfort the afflicted to hold the powerful to account. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=164.88s)]
*  You know, to be the eyes and ears of your readers and viewers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=167.8s)]
*  Like it does seem like they're a praetorian guard for the billionaire class. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=170.56s)]
*  I'm sorry to overstate it, but it feels that way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=173.44s)]
*  Yeah, you really see a lot of class solidarity right now among liberal elites. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=176.52s)]
*  And I'm saying this as a lefty, Tucker. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=181.4s)]
*  I'm coming at this from the left and feeling like how did we abandon the working class [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=183.12s)]
*  again of all races? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=187.84s)]
*  How did we become the side that comforts the comfortable and afflicts the afflicted? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=189.2s)]
*  So where does this go? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=194.8s)]
*  I mean, we need a working media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=195.96s)]
*  We need a media people trust. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=197.52s)]
*  It's an essential ingredient in democracy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=199.08s)]
*  I think everyone agrees with that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=201.08s)]
*  No one trusts the media anymore. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  So what's the next phase in this evolution? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=204.96s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=207.44s)]
*  Honestly, Tucker, I think that every American has to relearn the work of learning to respect [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=209.68s)]
*  people that we disagree with. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing a huge consumer boycott of mainstream media, of corporate media. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=217.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=222.24s)]
*  They need to relearn how to get our trust back. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=223.56s)]
*  And in the meantime, we need to start stitching back together the fabric of American society [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=226.36s)]
*  by respecting people we disagree with. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=231.48s)]
*  That's all we can do. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  I just have to ask, since you are on the left and I think you're articulating traditional [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=236.0s)]
*  left-wing concerns about economics, what do people on your side think of what you're saying [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  right now? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=246.0s)]
*  You know, honestly, you know, the fact that I was on CNN, I take that as a really good [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=249.0s)]
*  sign. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=252.88s)]
*  My book opens with a scene from CNN of two of their hosts who are both millionaires calling [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=253.88s)]
*  every single person who voted for Donald Trump racist when we know that Donald Trump won [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=259.44s)]
*  the vast majority of people without a college degree. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=265.8s)]
*  And to me, that was this primal scene of these people who had won by every metric, sneering [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=266.8s)]
*  and smearing the people who had lost. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=274.16s)]
*  And so I think it's a really good sign that CNN had me on to talk about my work. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=275.16s)]
*  God, that's, I could not have put it as well as you just did. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=278.96s)]
*  I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=283.4s)]
*  Bachia, Angar, Sogran, thank you very much. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=284.56s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxzvZ29zaXQ&t=287.0s)]
