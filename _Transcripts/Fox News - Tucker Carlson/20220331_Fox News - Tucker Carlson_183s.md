# Tucker shreds media over Hunter Biden coverage
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM)
*  So, something's going on with Joe Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=0.0s)]
*  His poll numbers are absolutely tanking, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=2.5s)]
*  but it seems like elements within the Democratic Party [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=4.54s)]
*  are turning on him. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=6.94s)]
*  We're not gonna pretend we understand [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=8.38s)]
*  exactly what's going on here, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=9.34s)]
*  but something definitely is. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=10.88s)]
*  Here's this example, and you remember this very well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=12.82s)]
*  Just before the last election, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=14.34s)]
*  the New York Post ran a story about the contents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=15.34s)]
*  of Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=17.46s)]
*  It was a huge story, but big tech censored it immediately. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=19.26s)]
*  CNN and dozens of other former intel officials [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=21.98s)]
*  told us that laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  There are fears that what Giuliani is now pushing here [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  in the United States could actually be part of Russia's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=30.82s)]
*  latest and very massive disinformation campaign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=33.66s)]
*  in the U.S. presidential election. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=37.24s)]
*  So, you have a president who is asking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=39.1s)]
*  to obtain Russian disinformation, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=41.56s)]
*  knowing that that is what it is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=43.24s)]
*  He is accepting that same information, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=45.1s)]
*  and he is then turning it and using it on the campaign trail [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=47.28s)]
*  against his opponent, and that's mind-blowing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  It's sort of a crazy quilt at this point, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  which has all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=57.5s)]
*  That said, it wasn't for lack of trying. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=60.58s)]
*  CNN reported on Friday that U.S. authorities are seeing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  if those emails we just talked about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=66.02s)]
*  are connected to an ongoing Russian disinformation effort. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=67.88s)]
*  So, it turns out when they accuse people [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=73.52s)]
*  of Russian disinformation, they're not always sincere. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=75.36s)]
*  Of course, they're liars. They'll say whatever they need [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=77.69999999999999s)]
*  to say. That was before the election. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  They needed to get Biden elected. They did it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=80.52s)]
*  But now they're telling you something very different. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=82.96s)]
*  Now they're telling you, in fact, the laptop is real. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=84.44s)]
*  You're seeing it yesterday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=87.02s)]
*  This is very, very bad for the president's son. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=88.96s)]
*  It is, and it's an investigation, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=92.36s)]
*  as you pointed out, going back to 2018. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=93.76s)]
*  And right now, prosecutors in Delaware [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=95.8s)]
*  are focusing on a number of things, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=99.9s)]
*  including whether Hunter Biden [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=101.2s)]
*  and some of his business associates violated laws, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  including tax and money laundering laws [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=106.9s)]
*  and foreign lobbying laws. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=109.48s)]
*  They're now gaining steam, and they need to make a decision, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=111.18s)]
*  I think, in the at least intermediate future. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=113.52s)]
*  This case has been going on for four years, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=116.08s)]
*  and there is a realistic chance this could result [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=118.14s)]
*  in federal charges, of course. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  Then we'd be in unprecedented political territory, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=122.06s)]
*  not legal territory, but a situation of having, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  potentially, the Justice Department prosecuting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  and trying to imprison the son of the president. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=130.16s)]
*  What a freak show that channel is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=134.56s)]
*  Good luck to their new subscription service. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=136.0s)]
*  But now they're telling you, yeah, it's all true, actually. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=138.8s)]
*  And that's not the only story about Russian disinformation [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  that has fallen apart this week. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  The Federal Election Commission just fined the DNC [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=146.16s)]
*  and Hillary Clintoner campaign more than $100,000. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=149.22s)]
*  The FEC determined that the Clinton campaign [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  tried to hide its role in funding the Steele dossier. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  Steele dossier is the false document [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=157.4s)]
*  that claimed, among many other things, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  that Putin got Trump elected. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=161.06s)]
*  Turns out the disinformation was, in fact, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  paid for by the campaign. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=167.9s)]
*  It was coming from the DNC. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdUNi9JsWM&t=170.58s)]
