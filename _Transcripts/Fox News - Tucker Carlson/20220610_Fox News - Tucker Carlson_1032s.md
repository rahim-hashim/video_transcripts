# Tucker Carlson: This is a scam
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=0.0s)]
*  I thank heaven it's Friday mostly because it's not Thursday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=2.16s)]
*  Yesterday was Thursday, a day that will live in shame in the history of the American news business. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=4.8s)]
*  Yesterday, last night, every news network in this country, but this one, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  faithfully surrendered its entire prime time lineup to Nancy Pelosi. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  So in place of news coverage, people who tuned in got two straight hours of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=21.28s)]
*  unedited campaign propaganda scripted by the Democratic Party. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=25.04s)]
*  The effect was North Korean, every channel the same. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=30.16s)]
*  Nothing like it has ever happened in this country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=33.44s)]
*  Now the news anchors who faithfully did Pelosi's bidding [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=35.6s)]
*  pretended they were airing some sort of congressional hearing, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=38.56s)]
*  but they were lying. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=42.32s)]
*  It was not a hearing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  At a hearing, dissent is permitted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=44.08s)]
*  The other side can speak. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=46.32s)]
*  Evidence is presented. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=47.92s)]
*  Evidence is not censored or deceptively edited. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=49.44s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=51.6s)]
*  So what we saw last night was definitely not a hearing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=53.04s)]
*  It was a show trial. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  There was no pretense of fairness or accuracy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=56.8s)]
*  The whole thing was indecent. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=59.36s)]
*  How many people were convinced by what they saw last night? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=62.0s)]
*  Right around zero. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=64.72s)]
*  They're not going to win a single vote. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=66.64s)]
*  So why'd they do it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=68.0s)]
*  There had to be a reason they're not that stupid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=69.2s)]
*  Well, the reason they did it is every minute news anchors are whining about some imaginary [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=72.4s)]
*  threat from QAnon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=77.2s)]
*  Remember QAnon? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=78.4s)]
*  Every minute they're doing that, they're not covering the collapse of the American economy, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=79.68s)]
*  something everyone actually cares about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=84.0s)]
*  Collapse is a strong word, but how would you describe it? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Today, inflation hit 8.6%. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Those are the official numbers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=92.4s)]
*  Those are the numbers arrived at using the government's own cooked metrics. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=94.0s)]
*  But it's still the highest increase in inflation in more than 40 years. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  So it's not surprising that consumer confidence is at the lowest level ever recorded. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=105.76s)]
*  Really, it comes down to energy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=106.4s)]
*  The cost of energy is up nearly 40% over last year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=108.4s)]
*  The average price of a gallon of gas is now over five bucks, but it won't stop there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  JPMorgan predicts it'll get to $6 and soon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  So when the price of fuel goes up, so does the price of everything else because our [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=119.84s)]
*  transportation systems are dependent on the price of fuel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=124.48s)]
*  And when it gets high enough, people can't go anywhere. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Even the police. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=132.72s)]
*  In Michigan, one department says it can no longer respond to emergency calls because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  the price of gas has gone too high. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=138.72s)]
*  Quote, we've exhausted what funds were budgeted for fuel with several months to go before [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=140.16s)]
*  the budget reset, said the sheriff of Isabella County on Tuesday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=144.8s)]
*  Quote, I've instructed the deputies to attempt to manage whatever calls are acceptable over [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  the phone. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=152.88s)]
*  So enforcing the law over the phone. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=154.08s)]
*  That sounds like a story from the third world, but that's America, it's Michigan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=157.6s)]
*  And it's just the beginning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=161.84s)]
*  A CNBC survey just found that 68% of corporate CFOs are predicting recession. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=163.6s)]
*  Soon. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=169.2s)]
*  Zero chief financial officers surveyed by CNBC believed a recession could be avoided. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=170.4s)]
*  All of them thought it was absolutely inevitable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  What are the effects? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=178.88s)]
*  Well, one of them is staples, food prices. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=179.68s)]
*  They were already up 5% in December. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=182.48s)]
*  They're now up more than 10% year over year. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  So when food becomes too expensive to buy, you have a crisis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=187.12s)]
*  How is the administration responding to this crisis? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=190.88s)]
*  A demonstrable crisis. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=193.2s)]
*  Well, Biden has just unveiled new regulations on ethanol. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=194.4s)]
*  By the way, here's a really simple test. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=199.2s)]
*  If you want to know, you're speaking to someone who understands anything about science or [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  the environment. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=205.68s)]
*  Anyone who tells you ethanol is good for the quote environment is either ignorant or lying. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=206.48s)]
*  We know after decades of studying it, that ethanol hurts the environment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=211.2s)]
*  There is no environmental benefit to ethanol. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=215.92s)]
*  And there's a massive cost both to the land and also to you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=219.36s)]
*  Thanks to Biden, gasoline refiners will be forced to blend 20 billion gallons of ethanol [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=225.36s)]
*  because it's a renewable fuel for the planet. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  But what this really is, is a requirement from the Biden administration to burn food [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=233.68s)]
*  in your car. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  That's what ethanol is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=241.36s)]
*  It's corn. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=243.12s)]
*  So what happens when you divert food crops like corn to ethanol production? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, we know the answer because it's been studied for decades. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  In 2008, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell called David Pimentel wrote this quote, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=253.28s)]
*  the use of corn for ethanol has led to major increases in the price of US beef, chicken, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=258.16s)]
*  pork, eggs, bread, cereal, milk. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=263.6s)]
*  It's a boon to agribusiness and a bane to consumers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=266.72s)]
*  In fact, the director general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports that using 22 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=269.44s)]
*  pounds of corn to produce one gallon of ethanol is already causing food shortages. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=274.88s)]
*  Well, of course, that was 2008. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=280.4s)]
*  This is not news. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=283.36s)]
*  Anyone who's been paying attention can tell you ethanol is bad for the environment. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=284.56s)]
*  It's terrible for engines. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=289.04s)]
*  And it is above all a disaster for your food supply. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=291.2s)]
*  So at the same moment we are facing food shortages, the Biden administration has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=296.08s)]
*  decided to make food scarcer and more expensive. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=301.04s)]
*  Food will be just as expensive as gasoline. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=305.36s)]
*  You probably hadn't heard about that because once again, last night, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=307.6s)]
*  every single news network in this country except ours was reporting on something else. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=311.28s)]
*  Here are their priorities. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=316.88s)]
*  This prime time presentation was both clear and it was compelling. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=318.88s)]
*  The first in a historic set of hearings here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=322.88s)]
*  This is not just about what happened on January 6th or in the days leading up to it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=325.84s)]
*  It's about a clear and present danger to our democracy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=330.32s)]
*  I have to say it's just historic to me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=332.8s)]
*  This was a hearing unlike any other. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=336.64s)]
*  I think the committee did a great job tonight. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=339.36s)]
*  I thought Liz Cheney was particularly strong. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  It was a very powerful, very well produced, if you will, two-hour presentation. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=344.24s)]
*  Tonight, the January 6th committee concluded the first of a series of its public hearings. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  And the point was abundantly clear. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=356.24s)]
*  Our democracy remains in danger. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=358.48s)]
*  These people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=362.8s)]
*  Now, normally you could just say, well, they're dumb. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=364.08s)]
*  That's why they're in TV in the first place, reading scripts that somebody else wrote. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=366.24s)]
*  I mean, it really is like Anchorman if you want to be totally honest about it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=371.12s)]
*  Hair hats, reading words they don't understand. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=374.8s)]
*  That is true. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=377.12s)]
*  That's actually what it is. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=377.68s)]
*  But in this case, it's more than ignorance. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=379.92s)]
*  It's more than stupidity. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=382.32s)]
*  It's complicity in a campaign to fool the public. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=383.68s)]
*  To make you believe that your personal concerns like the fact you can't buy food or drive [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=389.76s)]
*  anywhere or the police won't come because they can't afford gas, those are not important. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  What's really important is some other thing that you should be terrified of. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=401.36s)]
*  Russia, it's Putin. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=406.32s)]

*  It's the white supremacists. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=408.8s)]
*  They're going to get you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=409.76s)]
*  And anyone who worries about gas prices, anyone who's concerned about how to feed his or her [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=411.68s)]
*  family gets a lecture that actually you're just selfish. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=415.76s)]
*  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, really, or whatever the talking point is. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=420.32s)]
*  Here was CNN last night. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=424.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=426.0s)]
*  But I think for something like this to happen, to have an attack on the capitals, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=427.52s)]
*  have an attack on our democracy, to have a president of the United States saying [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  that he won the election when he didn't, I think that is more important than anything. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=434.96s)]
*  If you don't have a functioning democracy, then it doesn't matter if you have [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=440.08s)]
*  a penny gas prices. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=444.96s)]
*  You don't have a functioning democracy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  And people are going to think, what does this matter for gas prices or whatever? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=451.44s)]
*  We'll get to the gas prices. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=452.0s)]
*  That's always going to happen. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=452.96s)]
*  What does this mean for inflation? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=455.28s)]
*  We talk about that all the time. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=455.76s)]
*  What this means for our democracy is the most important thing, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=457.36s)]
*  and that's what we should be focusing on. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=460.32s)]
*  Oh, a civics lesson from Don Lamont. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=462.08s)]
*  Mr. Lamont, tell us about democracy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=464.32s)]
*  What is democracy? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  Just sum it up for us if you would. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  It's a term you use a lot. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=468.56s)]
*  What is democracy? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  Democracy is the process by which government represents voters and their concerns. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=471.04s)]
*  Voters vote on representatives. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=476.8s)]
*  They go to Washington and they carry with them in their hearts, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=477.92s)]
*  the memory of the people who put them there and their concerns are first and foremost. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=481.36s)]
*  So what are the first and foremost concerns of American voters? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=485.28s)]
*  The people at the heart of this democracy? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=488.24s)]
*  Well, food and gas prices. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  But the people who are defending democracy, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=494.08s)]
*  look at those people and say, shut up, you selfish rube. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=496.88s)]
*  You really should care about January 6th because democracy, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=500.96s)]
*  the overwhelming majority of Americans don't care about January 6th. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=505.2s)]
*  And that's why they need to beat you in the face with it again and again and again. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=509.12s)]
*  They wouldn't be hysterical. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=514.0s)]
*  They wouldn't be repetitive. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=515.2s)]
*  They wouldn't be patronizing if you actually cared, but you don't. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=516.48s)]
*  So they have to lecture you like a child. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=519.6s)]
*  So the midterms approaching, this is the Biden administration strategy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=522.4s)]
*  Talk about something else. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=526.72s)]
*  Shame you if you don't think it's the most important thing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=528.4s)]
*  So Biden began talking, hey, this was speech that was billed as an address on inflation, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=531.2s)]
*  but it didn't begin with inflation or any honest [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=535.6s)]
*  account of how we got here and how we're going to get out of it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=540.48s)]
*  No, it was about January 6th. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=543.36s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=545.68s)]
*  Before I begin, I want to say a few words very briefly about [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=547.2s)]
*  the January 6th hearings that were highlighted last night. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=551.52s)]
*  The insurrection on January 6th, one of the darkest chapters in our nation's history. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=555.76s)]
*  A brutal assault on our democracy, brutal attack on law enforcement, some losing their lives. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=560.72s)]
*  And we heard about it last night again. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  The know together, and I mean this, we can unite and defend this nation, Democrat and Republican, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=570.32s)]
*  allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=575.44s)]
*  I mean, the overstatement is so ridiculous. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=581.76s)]
*  You look at everything that's going on in the world. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  We know what happened on January 6th because no event in human history has had more cameras [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=589.36s)]
*  trained on it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=594.16s)]
*  You can watch the video. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=594.96s)]
*  You can spend the rest of your life watching the video on the internet. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=595.92s)]
*  Why don't you go ahead and do that? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=599.36s)]
*  Get back to us. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=600.64s)]
*  Does that look like a dagger at the heart of democracy? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=601.52s)]
*  Is that the darkest chapter in American history? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=604.24s)]
*  It's like insane to you. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=606.4s)]
*  We don't even talk like that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=607.28s)]
*  It's QAnon, really. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=609.04s)]
*  Trump is bad. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=610.24s)]
*  It's repulsive, actually, when you think about it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  Russia is threatening to destroy New York City with nuclear weapons. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=614.88s)]
*  How are we doing on that front? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=619.36s)]
*  Well, it turns out we're sourcing a critical component in our ammunition, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=620.96s)]
*  not just small arms, but nuclear weapons from China. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=627.28s)]
*  At a moment, we're actually closer to war than at any time in your lifetime, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=630.96s)]
*  at any time since 1945, since the big war ended. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=635.28s)]
*  We're closer right now than at any time since then. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=638.32s)]
*  And what are we doing about this? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=642.24s)]
*  What's the State Department doing to fix the crisis in Eastern Europe? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=643.2s)]
*  Well, they have, they just announced this, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=646.24s)]
*  they've hired a global equity ambassador. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=648.56s)]
*  Well, that'll fix it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh, more equity. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=654.16s)]
*  It's like rearranging bookshelves by title as your house burns down. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=655.04s)]
*  This is a species of mental illness. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=658.8s)]
*  Everybody sees how fake this is. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  Nobody is convinced by it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  It was just two years ago, live on television, summer of 2020, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=666.0s)]
*  a mob of Biden voters tried to storm the White House. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=668.8s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=670.8s)]
*  They torched a church across the street. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=671.28s)]
*  They attacked Secret Service officers. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  A mob called for the President of the United States to be lynched. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=675.1199999999999s)]
*  He was taken to an underground bunker for his safety. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=677.84s)]
*  We don't like to be hysterical, so we kind of downplayed it at the time. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=681.76s)]
*  Probably shouldn't have. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=684.88s)]
*  Maybe we should have been as hysterical as Joe Biden. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=685.52s)]
*  This is Pearl Harbor. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=688.08s)]
*  But that would have been lying, so we didn't. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=689.76s)]
*  This is what our country's capital looked like at the time. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=692.88s)]
*  I really sort of hate to get into the war of, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=738.4s)]
*  well, you think that's bad? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=740.88s)]
*  This was worse. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  Look at our tape. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=742.88s)]

*  Stop lying to us. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=747.12s)]
*  Stop telling us things that we know for a fact are not true [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=748.88s)]

*  You didn't hear anything about that last night, about similar riots [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  that destroyed cities all over the United States. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  You didn't hear a single word. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=764.0s)]
*  We're at the throat of our democracy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=765.76s)]
*  All of it happened in an election year [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=767.2s)]
*  with the aim of influencing the election. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=769.04s)]
*  Unmentioned. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=772.56s)]

*  a Supreme Court justice at his home [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=776.48s)]

*  Can't talk about any of this. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=781.36s)]
*  These topics, like the state of the US economy, are now off limits. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=782.88s)]
*  You have to pretend that January 6, 2021 remains the single worst thing [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=786.4s)]
*  ever to happen to America, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=791.12s)]
*  even though not one living person really believes that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=794.0s)]
*  And if you don't say so, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=796.8s)]
*  if you don't confess the one true faith in public, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=798.32s)]
*  you'll be hurt. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=801.76s)]
*  It just happened to an NFL coach called Jack Del Rio. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=802.88s)]
*  He just learned this lesson. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=805.52s)]
*  A completely Soviet moment. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=807.36s)]
*  We've got more on that in just a minute. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=809.2s)]
*  But first, take a few steps back. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=811.12s)]
*  So this is a perverse arrangement. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=813.44s)]
*  And you've got to wonder who benefits. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=815.76s)]
*  The Congress and the entirety of corporate media [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=818.32s)]
*  bury the actual problems facing the United States. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=821.52s)]
*  Pretend like they're not even happening. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=824.32s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=826.88s)]
*  And who is getting rich from it? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=828.0s)]
*  Inflation doesn't happen by accident. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=829.92s)]
*  It's the product of choices. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=831.76s)]
*  The inflation we're now living through was created on purpose. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=833.28s)]
*  The United States government got to a place where the debt was too big. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=838.08s)]
*  And the only answer was to inflate it away. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  If you are a major debt holder, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=847.36s)]
*  the only way out for you is to make the money less valuable. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=850.88s)]
*  And so they did this on purpose. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=855.84s)]
*  They want inflation to skyrocket, of course, and continue to rise. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=858.32s)]
*  You're not going to hear any of that [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=863.44s)]
*  from the professional commentators on cable news, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=864.48s)]
*  but you will hear it from people who still have common sense, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=867.28s)]
*  like this guy at a gas station today. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=869.6s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=870.96s)]
*  The economic jolt is not felt equally. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=872.16s)]
*  A new Bank of America report found household credit card spending for fuel [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=875.3599999999999s)]
*  surged to 7.8% by the end of May, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=879.3599999999999s)]
*  but a whopping 9.5% for families making under $50,000. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  They call it inflation, but somebody's pocket is getting inflated. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  We're the ones hurting down here, you know, the poor people. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=890.24s)]
*  Okay. So inflation almost certainly is hurting you. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=894.4s)]
*  In fact, a new analysis out today showed that the average family [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=900.0s)]
*  will pay this year a full month in its total income, just in inflation. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=906.4s)]
*  A full month. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=913.28s)]
*  Who's it good for? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=915.6s)]
*  Well, if you've got massive corporate debt, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=916.56s)]
*  it's a really good deal because you get to pay yesterday's accounts, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=920.0s)]
*  yesterday's debts with today's inflated dollars. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=924.56s)]
*  That money has lower real value, so you are getting a deal. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=928.4s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=931.52s)]
*  They're doing this on purpose, but you could only pull that off [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=932.88s)]
*  if the people you were hurting were completely distracted. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  So let's scream at them some more about January 6th. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=939.68s)]
*  Then they might not notice. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  At this point, we don't really have a choice but to tolerate inflation. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=944.64s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=947.92s)]
*  The traditional way to attack inflation is to raise interest rates, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  but inflation has gotten so high that it's going to be pretty tough to do that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=952.72s)]
*  U.S. debt to GDP now stands at nearly 125%. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=957.2s)]
*  That means for every point we raise the interest rate, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=961.36s)]
*  we're going to wind up paying even more in interest charges on that debt. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=964.0s)]
*  If the Fed tries to raise interest rates anyway to the point [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  they might actually affect inflation, what will that do? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  Let's say you bumped at 11 points, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=975.12s)]
*  which you'd probably have to do to get inflation under control. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=976.88s)]
*  Jerome Powell, who runs the Fed, has already said there's no limit [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=979.6s)]
*  to how high interest rates could go. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=982.72s)]
*  At least one financial expert has said 6% interest rates could be coming, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=985.2s)]
*  and maybe that's just a start, on top of the ones we've already seen. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=988.8000000000001s)]
*  Now what would that mean for you? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=992.48s)]
*  Well, interest rates that high would crush Americans with credit card debt, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=994.72s)]
*  and that's most of the country. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it's the highest rate ever. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1001.44s)]
*  It would make buying a house basically impossible. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1002.88s)]
*  It would crash markets. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1005.84s)]
*  It would crush asset prices. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1007.44s)]
*  Are we going to do that? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1010.24s)]
*  That's kind of our option. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1011.2s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  So record inflation is likely here to stay. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1014.48s)]
*  If you want to know why they're talking about January 6th and primetime, that's why. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KMExbfZH4&t=1017.7600000000001s)]
