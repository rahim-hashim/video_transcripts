# Jamie Dimon issued a warning by Missouri Treasurer
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0)
*  Welcome back with the Fox Nation Patriot Awards in Hollywood, Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=0.0s)]
*  We are all in on Fox Nation and not just because they throw great parties and they're nice [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=5.04s)]
*  people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=10.22s)]
*  We're all in on Fox Nation because it's protected from the tech monopolies that control almost [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=11.22s)]
*  every part of American life. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=16.26s)]
*  But they don't control Fox Nation subscription service. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=18.1s)]
*  We can say whatever we want. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=20.94s)]
*  We don't have to be afraid because they're not pulling the strings. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=22.88s)]
*  And that's worth a lot right now, we think. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  Here's an example, by the way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=28.3s)]
*  A book can happen if you're not protected. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=29.3s)]
*  WePay is the subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=31.46s)]
*  Recently, WePay decided to deny payment processing services to a major conservative group in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=33.78s)]
*  Missouri, a group called the Defense of Liberty. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=39.46s)]
*  WePay claimed the group was involved in, quote, hate, violence, racial intolerance, and terrorism. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=42.1s)]
*  Were they? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=48.74s)]
*  No. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=50.34s)]
*  Scott Fitzpatrick is the state treasurer of Missouri. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  He's demanding evidence those accusations are true. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=54.86s)]
*  So far, WePay has not provided it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=57.78s)]
*  Scott Fitzpatrick joins us now to explain. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Fitzpatrick, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=61.34s)]
*  And thank you for being one of the very few elected officials to do anything about this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=64.42s)]
*  Is this a violation of the law, do you believe? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=69.5s)]
*  Well, I think Chase has the, I guess, the right to do whatever they want in terms of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=71.62s)]
*  who they do business with. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=76.3s)]
*  But in terms of who we as the state of Missouri are going to do business with, we won't be [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=77.3s)]
*  doing business with any bank in the state treasurer's office that chooses to discriminate against [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=80.92s)]
*  essentially half the population, the conservative half the population. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=85.54s)]
*  And they decided to do this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=89.62s)]
*  They suspended the Defense of Liberty, whose founder is a guy named Paul Kurtman, who's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=90.86000000000001s)]
*  a Marine Corps veteran that deployed to the Middle East and fought in the war on terror [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=94.78s)]
*  and then came back to Missouri and was a state representative that I served with for six [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  He's a great limited government free market conservative who brings these events together. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  The speaker at this next event that they were going to have that WePay essentially cancelled [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  and is causing to be rescheduled. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=114.58s)]
*  It was going to be Donald Trump Jr. and Cecilia Johnson, who's the director of Black Engagement [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=115.58s)]
*  for the RNC. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=120.14s)]
*  And like you said, they've essentially accused them of being a hate organization, a racist [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=121.14s)]
*  organization with no evidence. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=125.9s)]
*  And they also said that their decision making process is proprietary and therefore no additional [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=127.78s)]
*  information could be given to them, but that the decision was final. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=132.38s)]
*  And so I sent a letter today to Jamie Dimon, who's, as you know, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=135.38s)]
*  essentially told them that as long as they're going to discriminate against half the country [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=140.3s)]
*  and frankly what's about 60 percent of Missourians according to the last election and not do business [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=144.34s)]
*  with conservative organizations, that they're not going to be eligible to do business with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  the state of Missouri. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=152.86s)]
*  Amen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=154.86s)]
*  Really quick, last week in New York, a leader of the Black Lives Matter organization threatened [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=155.86s)]
*  violence against the sitting mayor of New York if he dared to enforce the law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=160.24s)]
*  In New York, are they still a client of JP Morgan Chase? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  Were they deplatformed too? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  Do you know Black Lives Matter? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=169.66000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  I don't think that they've deplatformed them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=172.1s)]
*  They're only interested in deplatforming conservatives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=174.54s)]
*  And if they're only interested in doing business with one half of the country, they can change [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=176.54s)]
*  their name to Woke Bank or Snowflake Bank or something. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=180.62s)]
*  So we'll see how it goes though. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=183.42s)]
*  Scott Fitzpatrick, I appreciate you coming on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=187.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEUFCo2AiU0&t=190.01999999999998s)]
