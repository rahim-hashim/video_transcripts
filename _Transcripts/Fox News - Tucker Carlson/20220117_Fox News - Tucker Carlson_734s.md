# Tucker: Biden is now getting bashed by this trusted group
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Monday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=3.48s)]
*  For Joe Biden, the past few months have amounted [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=4.92s)]
*  to the greatest political disaster of his life. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  And in his case, that's not a small place to be. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=10.6s)]
*  This is a man with three failed presidential campaigns [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=13.08s)]
*  on his resume. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  But this year has been different. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=17.44s)]
*  And we don't mean to overstate it, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=19.16s)]
*  but you can pick your humiliating ashes [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=20.36s)]
*  and sack cloth world historic defeat, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=22.32s)]
*  Stalingrad, Corregidor, Gallipoli. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=24.8s)]
*  And that's pretty much where Joe Biden is right now, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=27.2s)]
*  politically. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=29.88s)]
*  Polls show him losing astounding levels of support [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=31.2s)]
*  from virtually every group of Americans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=34.2s)]
*  who voted for him just a year ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=36.04s)]
*  That would include Hispanics, moderate Democrats, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=38.28s)]
*  African-Americans, and by big double digits, independents. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=40.72s)]
*  At this point, the White House is down [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=45.56s)]
*  to just two core constituencies, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  anxious upper income women with multiple college degrees [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=49.92s)]
*  and barren personal lives, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=52.84s)]
*  and members of the national news media. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=54.64s)]
*  And even that may be overstating Biden's support, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=56.56s)]
*  given that there's such dramatic overlap [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=59.16s)]
*  between those two groups. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=61.08s)]
*  Essentially, they're the same people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=62.12s)]
*  And now, because it can always get worse, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=64.12s)]
*  Biden appears to be losing even the media. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=66.72s)]
*  This is an ominous development. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=69.96s)]
*  In fact, it's not an exaggeration to say [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=71.52s)]
*  that if this trend continues, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=73.32s)]
*  it is the end of the Biden presidency. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  The media are the only reason Joe Biden is president [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=77.56s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=80.28s)]
*  Biden didn't campaign for the job. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=81.64s)]
*  He didn't hold rallies or give speeches [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=83.56s)]
*  or tell the public what he might do if elected. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  No, for nearly a year, Joe Biden stayed home, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=88.52s)]
*  hiding in terror from infectious voters. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Instead, he let news organizations make his case for him, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=94.6s)]
*  which they assiduously did. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=97.24s)]
*  The media hid Biden's faults. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  They attacked and censored his critics. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=100.92s)]
*  In general, they gave no hint at all [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=103.16s)]
*  that you might be electing a senile mannequin [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=105.12s)]
*  with a lifelong history of sleazy behavior. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=107.52s)]
*  Voters had no clue. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=110.28s)]
*  They didn't know who Joe Biden actually was. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=111.12s)]
*  And yet, suddenly, news organizations [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=114.08s)]
*  have decided to tell them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=115.84s)]
*  It's pretty amazing to watch it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=117.76s)]
*  Here's some clips from just the last few days. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=119.2s)]
*  President Joe Biden has had a very tough week [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=125.0s)]
*  with setbacks for his agenda, COVID complications, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=127.4s)]
*  and the Supreme Court blocking his vaccine mandate. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=131.12s)]
*  One year in, Mr. Biden has the second lowest approval rating [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=134.2s)]
*  ever measured in the White House [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=137.48s)]
*  and has never been less popular nationally. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=139.36s)]
*  2022 is not exactly off to a good start [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=141.68s)]
*  for the Biden administration. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=145.8s)]
*  The country is frustrated. His party is frustrated. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  We're two weeks into a midterm election year, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=150.76s)]
*  a few days away from his one-year anniversary [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=152.88s)]
*  of inauguration, and it is black. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  It is very dark for him right now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Now he's in the midst of what one famous children's book [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  writer called a terrible, horrible, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=160.44s)]
*  no-good, very bad time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Ooh, a very tough week of setbacks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=166.32s)]
*  The country is frustrated. That's CNN's assessment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=168.44s)]
*  If it sounds mild to you, you should consider the source. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=172.0s)]
*  CNN criticizing a sitting Democratic president? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=174.76s)]
*  That's like the College of Cardinals attacking the Pope. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=178.04s)]
*  It is a violation of ecclesiastical authority. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=180.68s)]
*  You never see it, and when it happens, it means something. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=183.36s)]
*  MSNBC went even further than that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=186.92s)]
*  One of its contributors decided to come out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=188.92s)]
*  and tell the channel's viewers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=190.52s)]
*  something they had never heard before. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=191.84s)]
*  Joe Biden is old, really, really old, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=194.04s)]
*  possibly too old to govern a nation of 335 million people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=196.68s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=201.0s)]
*  Your audience is not gonna be happy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=202.04s)]
*  with what I have to say is I don't think he's come across [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=204.08s)]
*  as an inspirational figure. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=206.6s)]
*  I don't think, by the way, I can give a litany [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=208.12s)]
*  of things he's accomplished, and obviously, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=210.72s)]
*  and Jonathan Lemire laid out things [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=212.24s)]
*  that have not gone well for him, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=213.64s)]
*  but there's something else different. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=215.2s)]
*  How many people do you talk to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=216.24s)]
*  when they say he seems old? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=218.16s)]
*  And I don't mean that as an ageist thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=221.12s)]
*  He doesn't, and it really started with Afghanistan [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=223.2s)]
*  where he just didn't seem to have his hand [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=226.88s)]
*  firmly on the wheel, and I think a lot of this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=228.48s)]
*  has to do with the messenger versus the messages itself. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=231.08s)]
*  He doesn't feel in charge. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=234.56s)]
*  No, wait a second now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=237.8s)]
*  You're telling us that Joe Biden doesn't, quote, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=239.96s)]
*  seem to have his hand firmly on the wheel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=242.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=245.44s)]
*  You sure we're talking about the same president here? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  Wasn't this the guy who not so long ago [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  was challenging strangers to push-up contests at town halls? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=251.28s)]
*  This is the guy who single-handedly rescued [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  Nelson Mandela from the hell of Robben Island. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  This is the man who faced down corn pop [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=260.08s)]
*  with a chain at a public swimming pool. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=261.96s)]
*  Now you're saying that man, that chiseled monument [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=264.32s)]
*  to decisive masculinity may be losing his grip? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=267.08s)]
*  Yep, that's exactly what they're saying, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  and they seem almost bashfully apologetic as they say it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=273.52s)]
*  They had no idea Joe Biden was a lumbering, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  desiccated husk, no idea at all. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=279.0s)]
*  They never saw Biden call anyone a dog-paced pony soldier. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=281.84s)]
*  They didn't notice him sniffing anybody's hair [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=286.2s)]
*  or staring blankly into the middle distance [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=288.76s)]
*  like a lobotomy patient. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=290.64s)]
*  They never saw it. They're as shocked as you are. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=291.84s)]
*  Watch CNN's resident Nobel Prize winner [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=295.12s)]
*  come to the awful conclusion [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=297.32s)]
*  that maybe Joe Biden isn't doing an amazing job as president. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=299.56s)]
*  President Biden left Washington tonight [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=303.44s)]
*  to spend the weekend at home in Delaware. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=305.24s)]
*  He probably couldn't wait to get out of town [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=307.28s)]
*  after one of the worst weeks of his year-old presidency. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=309.08s)]
*  A series of setbacks on voting rights, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=312.92s)]
*  the Supreme Court blocking his vaccine mandate [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=314.64s)]
*  and soaring inflation, driving up prices for consumers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=317.76s)]
*  And today, we saw the news [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=321.16s)]
*  that the retail sales last month were awful, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=322.68s)]
*  plus Omicron is still causing havoc [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  with staffing shortages and empty shelves, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=327.64s)]
*  and some Senate Democrats are upset with the White House [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=329.64s)]
*  over testing shortages. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=332.2s)]
*  I mean, I could go on, but I mean, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=335.52s)]
*  it's a bad week for the president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=338.36s)]
*  Is there any way to cut it, other way to say it? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=340.56s)]
*  So Joe Biden's never at the White House, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=343.56s)]
*  and he's right about that, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=346.24s)]
*  but it's possible CNN missed the larger point. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=347.4s)]
*  Biden isn't fleeing Washington [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  because he's upset about political defeats. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=351.44s)]
*  Biden is being dragged into isolation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=354.12s)]
*  by advisors who are terrified he will get corona [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=356.2s)]
*  like everyone else right now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=358.96s)]
*  They want him out of the city as quickly as possible. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=360.44s)]
*  They know exactly how well masks and vaccines work. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=362.32s)]
*  They're not betting on Dr. Fauci's guidance, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=366.24s)]
*  but whatever, details, details. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  The point is, CNN is running away from Joe Biden. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=369.76s)]
*  Even Don Lamont can see where this is going. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=373.8s)]
*  He may be stupid, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=376.2s)]
*  but his animal instincts are fully intact. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  Don Lamont can recognize a sinking ship when he sees one, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=379.44s)]
*  and he's decided to disembark as swiftly as he can. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=382.12s)]
*  Make for the lifeboats! CNN anchors first! [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=384.64s)]
*  Maybe if people like Don Lamont [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=389.44s)]
*  repeatedly make disappointed noises about Joe Biden, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=391.28s)]
*  no one will remember how they sounded a year ago [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=394.48s)]
*  and hold them responsible for this disaster. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  But we will. We remember. We saved the tape. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=399.48s)]
*  Here's Don Lamont weeping with joy over Joe Biden's election [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=402.56s)]
*  like Jesus had just returned to make gym memberships free [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  and forgive everybody's student loans. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=409.04s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  How you feeling? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=412.48s)]
*  It's, I almost can't talk right now because of the emotion. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=416.12s)]
*  Everyone is welcome under this tent. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=420.68s)]
*  We don't care who you are. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't care if you voted for us or not. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  You're all part of this American experiment. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=427.92s)]
*  It was, I was so overwhelmed to hear that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=430.56s)]
*  I don't care what people think. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=433.52s)]
*  If they think I'm biased or not, I don't care. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I'm very emotional. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=437.2s)]
*  So when you ask me how I'm feeling right now, I'm sorry. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=438.68s)]
*  That's all I can tell you. This is how I feel right now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=442.24s)]
*  I am so happy to have this platform to be able to do this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  I may not have it after this, but I really don't care. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=446.96s)]
*  I am so happy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  We don't care if you voted for us, not Joe Biden, for us. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=454.08s)]
*  Meaning Joe Biden's friends and co-conspirators over at CNN. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=459.04s)]
*  I really don't care. I'm so happy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=463.04s)]
*  That's the tape. There you have it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=466.32s)]
*  If this were a trial, that would be the pivotal evidence. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=468.24s)]
*  The glove fits, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=471.0s)]
*  You cannot acquit. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=473.12s)]
*  The media foisted this Biden calamity on the United States. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=475.28s)]
*  They got him elected. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=478.64s)]
*  Then they lied and distracted the population [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=479.88s)]
*  as he and the marionette operators who controlled him [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=482.24s)]
*  wrecked a lot of this country. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=484.52s)]
*  That happened, and it's too late now to deny responsibility. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  These people are fully implicated in what they did. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=490.72s)]
*  Lots of them are. It's not just Don Lamont. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  Watch this member of Congress from Silicon Valley, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=496.20000000000005s)]
*  one of the smarter members, we've got to say, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  decide that actually maybe big tech [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=500.24s)]
*  shouldn't have censored legitimate stories, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=502.52000000000004s)]
*  truthful stories about Hunter Biden's laptop after all. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=504.6s)]
*  Maybe that was a mistake. Watch. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=508.04s)]
*  I am not for having either the government [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=511.16s)]
*  or tech companies ultimately being the arbiter of truth. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=514.92s)]
*  I'm for making sure that we don't have speech [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  that incites violence, but I'm very wary of censorship. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=524.0s)]
*  In fact, in the book I write about how I thought [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  it was a mistake for Twitter to take down some of this stuff [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=530.56s)]
*  about Hunter Biden or Facebook to do that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that story was total hogwash. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=536.8s)]
*  I think Joe Biden was unfairly attacked because of his son, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=539.0s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that it didn't belong [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=542.84s)]
*  in the public sphere. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're not for censorship. Oh, you're not for censorship. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  Thanks for that, Congressman. Great. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  But where were you when it mattered, say, last October, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=553.52s)]
*  right before the election, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=556.4s)]
*  when people were trying to figure out who to vote for? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=557.48s)]
*  Oh, you were staying dead silent like the rest of them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=559.2s)]
*  You were letting it happen. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=561.4s)]
*  You were allowing democracy to corrode and die [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  because at the time you thought it was worth it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was just too scary. Trump was an emergency, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  so we had to suspend the Constitution [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=569.24s)]
*  to make this into an unfree country. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  We had no choice. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=572.48s)]
*  But now that he's in office, some of these people [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=574.72s)]
*  are apparently having second thoughts now. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=576.4s)]
*  But why now? What exactly is going on here? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=579.32s)]
*  And why is everyone suddenly saying the same thing out once? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=582.6s)]
*  We could answer the second part of that question [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=585.4s)]
*  with absolute certainty. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=586.72s)]
*  Everyone in the Democratic Party sounds exactly alike [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=588.16s)]
*  because of message discipline is what they do. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=590.6s)]
*  It's who they are. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=593.04s)]
*  No one in the party thinks independently. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=594.28s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=596.28s)]
*  Everybody in the group must say the very same thing [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=597.64s)]
*  in concert with everybody else in the group all the time. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  Period. It's like a North Korean singing troupe. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  Deviationists are punished. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  Think for yourself even for a second [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  and you are denounced as a conspiracy theorist [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=609.4s)]
*  who thinks horse dewormer is medicine. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=611.52s)]
*  You see it every day. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  We can give you a million examples of this. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=614.92s)]
*  Our producer, Tom Fox, the genius who finds our tape [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=617.0s)]
*  every night for the show, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  often says he's got the most repetitive job in television [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=620.48s)]
*  because everybody on every channel [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=623.04s)]
*  sounds exactly the same all the time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=624.48s)]
*  Here's one recent chorus of dummies. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=626.88s)]
*  The things that would bring thousands of angry people [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=630.04s)]
*  to the Capitol for one of America's darkest days [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=631.64s)]
*  became one of the darkest days in American political history. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=633.76s)]
*  The very next day was one of the darkest days [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=636.92s)]
*  in this nation's history. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=638.4s)]
*  To one of the most dramatic and dark days [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  in American history. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the darkest days in US history. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=643.76s)]
*  This was one of the darkest days in American history [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=646.52s)]
*  and we expect the president to say just that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=649.0799999999999s)]
*  Now all of these very same people are simultaneously [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  trashing the president they got elected [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=656.48s)]
*  and have defended through everything for a year. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=658.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  Now we're not alleging an intentional conspiracy here. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=662.44s)]
*  We don't take horse dewormer. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=665.2s)]
*  We're not saying there was a secret conference call [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=666.76s)]
*  between Jeff Zucker, Joy Reid [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=668.5600000000001s)]

*  Who'd even want to endure something like that? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=671.6s)]
*  More likely it's a conspiracy of instinct. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  For all the talk you hear of diversity, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=676.6s)]
*  there is precisely zero diversity in our national media. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  People may have different skin tones [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=682.24s)]
*  or different sexual interests. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=683.84s)]
*  Not relevant. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=685.72s)]
*  They're all from such similar backgrounds [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=687.0s)]
*  with such similar beliefs and values and life experiences [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=689.36s)]
*  that their gut reactions to everything [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=693.56s)]
*  have aligned into perfect synchronicity [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=695.64s)]
*  like menstruating teenagers at summer camp. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=697.84s)]
*  They speak as one because on the deepest level [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=700.44s)]
*  they're indistinguishable from each other. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=703.08s)]
*  But still you wonder there's got to be [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=705.8s)]
*  some kind of political point to this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=707.04s)]
*  There's got to be. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=708.52s)]
*  No one at CNN is ever going to undermine [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=709.72s)]
*  the long-term prospects of the Democratic party [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=711.6s)]
*  at least not intentionally. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=713.52s)]
*  If they snatch the walker from Joe Biden's hands [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=715.28s)]
*  and that's exactly what they're doing, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  who do they think is going to take over when he falls? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giKm50Q1VVY&t=718.76s)]
