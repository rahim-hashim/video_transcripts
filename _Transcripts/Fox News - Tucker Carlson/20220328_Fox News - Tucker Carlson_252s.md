# Tulsi Gabbard accuses Facebook, Instagram of shadow banning her
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs)
*  following this topic very closely, taking a lot of heat for it, but telling the truth regardless. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on tonight. So, you know, it's not even a personal attack [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  on Biden, and I certainly don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone in his present condition, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=9.68s)]
*  but the United States, the future of the country hangs in the balance. And I don't understand [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=14.64s)]
*  how the Democratic Party can continue to support someone who's completely out of control. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=19.2s)]
*  I think what we're seeing here, Tucker, is you're focusing on his comments about regime changes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=24.8s)]
*  It was not a gaffe at all. President Biden just said out loud what the aims and objectives of his [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=28.96s)]
*  administration's policies are, which is regime change in Russia, to get Putin out of power. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=34.32s)]
*  And, you know, they're doing so through using the primary weapons of economic warfare. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  They're doing so by waging this modern-day siege against Russia, isolating, containing, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=46.96s)]
*  destroying their economy, starving the Russian people in the hopes that the Russian people or [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=53.6s)]
*  the military will rise up and revolt and overthrow their government and get rid of Putin. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=57.76s)]
*  And the reason why they're lying about this to the American people, Tucker, is they know [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=63.28s)]
*  that we are sick and tired of our country-waging regime change wars. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=67.44s)]
*  We remember how costly and devastating these wars in Iraq and Libya and Syria and others [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=72.08s)]
*  have been, and we reject them wholeheartedly. So if they were to come out and tell the truth, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=77.2s)]
*  their polls would tank even more than they already are and their politics would suffer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=82.8s)]
*  And that's really where we have to... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=88.32s)]
*  I believe you completely that clearly they want that. But what comes after? Killing people is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=90.88s)]
*  relatively easy. Building things is really hard. So this is a real country with 140 million people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=97.84s)]
*  living in it, huge energy reserves. Putin goes, then what? Have they thought that through? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=103.52s)]
*  I mean, the answer to that is clearly no. And this isn't just my opinion. We have history to look [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  forward to the answer to this question. In every one of these regime change wars, we've seen how [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=116.56s)]
*  the answer to the question, what happens next? Who takes charge after you topple that dictator? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=121.44s)]
*  What weapons will they have under their control? They never have an answer to that question. And [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  what we're seeing play out before us is following that exact same track record. Only more dangerous [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=132.16s)]
*  than the other. And obviously so. Because the American people are smart enough to know that a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=139.04s)]
*  regime change war against a nuclear armed Russia is very different from any other that's been waged [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=143.6s)]
*  before and will result in disastrous consequences that go beyond anything we could even imagine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=148.88s)]
*  Yeah. I thank you for... I mean, these are people who couldn't keep track of their own [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  dangerous biological agents they were funding in Ukraine. They have no idea where they are, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=160.72s)]
*  obviously. They're going to keep track of 6,000 nuclear weapons. I don't think so. So you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=164.16s)]
*  almost nobody else in the public sphere is saying... You've said recently that Facebook, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=168.16s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, has been suppressing your message. Here's the clip of you explaining. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=173.6s)]
*  When people try to type my name into the search box on Instagram or the Discover Box, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=179.92s)]
*  my account does not show up. I'm also getting a lot of reports from people who are trying to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=185.6s)]
*  at me, at my name, at Tulsi Gabbard and mention me in their Instagram stories or posts. And [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=189.68s)]
*  getting a warning that says this account has posted false information. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=194.64s)]
*  So we're fighting for freedom in Ukraine, but we can't speak freely in this country. That's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  kind of conclusion I'm coming to. Yeah, that pretty much that's the conclusion is, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=204.0s)]
*  you know, Big Tech is is acting as this dictatorship telling us what we're allowed to say, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=209.44s)]
*  what we're not allowed to say. You know, the thing with that they're saying, they're spreading [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=216.0s)]
*  misinformation. Once again, there's no evidence, there's no examples, there's no notice from them [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=218.72s)]
*  saying, hey, this is what you're saying that's false. Right. Absolutely none of that. So it comes [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=223.44s)]
*  down to if they don't like what you're saying, if you're shining a light on the truth, then you're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=227.52s)]
*  going to be shut down or silenced. Yeah. Well, I'd like to have some freedom here. I think that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=231.6s)]
*  would be our first our first concern. I agree. Great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EseSsywvkhs&t=236.24s)]
