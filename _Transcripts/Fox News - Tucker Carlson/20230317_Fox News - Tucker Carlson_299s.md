# SEE IT: Reporter goes after Mayor Lori Lightfoot at city council meeting
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc)
*  Well, now the Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has lost re-election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=0.0s)]
*  She'll be leaving office soon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=4.0s)]
*  And a lot of journalists in the city are thrilled about that because Lightfoot waged a war on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=5.2s)]
*  press freedom. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=10.08s)]
*  At one point she even refused to let white reporters interview her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=11.08s)]
*  Lightfoot also pulled the press credentials of reporter William J. Kelly because she didn't [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=15.4s)]
*  like his reporting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=18.6s)]
*  On Wednesday, at a city council meeting, Kelly gave Lightfoot this sendoff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=20.3s)]
*  People of Chicago elected you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=25.96s)]
*  You shut down our schools. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=29.46s)]
*  You shut down the churches. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=31.54s)]
*  You shut down the businesses. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=33.5s)]
*  You did the one thing that I thought could never happen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=35.64s)]
*  As somebody who was born and raised on the south side of Chicago, I never thought in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=38.96s)]
*  my life that I would ever see the city of Chicago brought down so low as you have managed [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=43.18s)]
*  to bring it down. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=50.36s)]
*  Shame on you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=52.78s)]
*  That is a legacy that you are going to have to carry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=56.82s)]
*  Future historians are going to have a hard time understanding how you ever even became [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=62.28s)]
*  mayor of the city of Chicago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=69.0s)]
*  I hope that you realize what damage you have done to the city. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=70.52s)]
*  I hope that after today's city council meeting, you will pack your suitcase and get the hell [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=76.44s)]
*  out of my city. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=83.16s)]
*  She's going to be getting the hell out of office, that's for sure. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=85.0s)]
*  William J. Kelly is a journalist in Chicago and he joins us now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=87.66s)]
*  William, great to have you on the program. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=91.1s)]
*  I can't help but notice that was a city council meeting. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a press briefing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=95.28s)]
*  It wasn't a Q&A. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=96.72s)]
*  That looked like a public comment. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=97.72s)]
*  Why was that the circumstances of your statement to Mayor Lori Lightfoot? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=99.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=104.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me, Will. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=105.82s)]
*  Well, like everything else in the city of Chicago now, it's Mission Impossible meets [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  Kobayashi Maru. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=112.72s)]
*  We had traditionally Mayor Lightfoot would do a press conference after every city council [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=114.28s)]
*  meeting. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=120.6s)]
*  But of course, this being her last city council meeting due to the fact that she lost her [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=121.6s)]
*  reelection campaign, she canceled her city council press conference. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=127.02s)]
*  So I knew that if I was going to have a chance to speak to her at all, I would have to register [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=132.26s)]
*  for the public comment section. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=137.62s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  It was a lottery. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  Only five people, only five names were drawn from a big glass bowl. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=144.06s)]
*  And miraculously, mine was one of them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=148.94s)]
*  And I was given three minutes and, you know, 60 seconds worth the distance run times three. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=152.16s)]
*  You know, luck of the Irish there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=159.16s)]
*  But not without effort. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=161.12s)]
*  You had to enter the lottery to get a chance to speak to your mayor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=162.12s)]
*  Why was this so important for you to say what you said to Lightfoot? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, it was extremely important, Will, because over the course of the last few years, a number [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=169.04s)]
*  of people have contacted me, reached out to me and said, you know, here's a question I [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=175.88s)]
*  would like for you to ask the mayor. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Here's something I would like you to say. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Police officers who have been overworked and obviously mistreated and a spike in police [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=185.2s)]
*  suicides as a result. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=191.28s)]
*  And I feel like this particular city council meeting was an opportunity, was the last chance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  that I may ever have to actually tell Mayor Lori Lightfoot not just what was on my mind, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=201.28s)]
*  but what was on the minds of so many Chicagoans. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=207.08s)]
*  And I'm just thankful that I had the opportunity to do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=210.44s)]
*  And I heard in that moment where you told her you hope the history is written accurately, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  that you intend to write that book, that you intend to write the history of these years [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=216.6s)]
*  in Chicago. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=220.06s)]
*  We could hear that in the video clip of your appearance there in the city council. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=221.36s)]
*  What we cannot hear, William, is the response of the mayor or the council. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  What did they say to you at the end of your statement? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=229.56s)]
*  Well, you know, to add insult to injury, after I'm done giving my public comment or victim [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  impact statement is how I actually viewed it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  One of Mayor Lightfoot's city council allies heckled me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=241.44000000000003s)]
*  She actually said, you know, she called me a derogatory name. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=247.88s)]
*  And then she said that all of the problems that Mayor Lori Lightfoot, you know, had to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  handle or mishandle was the result of the pandemic. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=255.6s)]
*  And you know, I just, I guess, channeled the entire city of Chicago and let this city council [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=259.52s)]
*  woman know that she was in fact the pandemic. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=265.64s)]
*  Well, in Chicago for the moment, at least, it looks like there's some relief from the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=270.24s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=274.68s)]
*  I hope that the circumstances in that city, which have been largely made it unlivable [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=275.68s)]
*  for the past several years, are alleviated. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=279.68s)]
*  And we appreciate you hopping on with us tonight, William J. Kelly, and for that moment in front [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AiSrQmDJc&t=282.72s)]
