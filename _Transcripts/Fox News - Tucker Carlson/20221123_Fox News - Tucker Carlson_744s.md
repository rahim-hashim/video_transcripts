# Tucker Carlson: This is a grotesque and filthy lie
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you've been watching the news recently, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=3.6s)]
*  the one thing you know for certain [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=6.12s)]
*  about the accused gunman and the massacre in Colorado [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=8.16s)]
*  over the weekend is that he was a crazed right wing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=10.76s)]
*  anti-trans extremist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  This is a man who was radicalized by this show [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=16.12s)]
*  and by the Twitter account Libs of TikTok [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=18.92s)]
*  to hate transgendered people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=21.2s)]
*  And that's why this man walked into a bar, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  a gay bar with a gun and started murdering people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  He did that because he was taught [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=28.48s)]
*  by right wing media outlets to despise and fear [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=29.8s)]
*  the non-binary community. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=32.88s)]
*  And that's why this show and Libs of TikTok [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=34.8s)]
*  must be hauled into court and bankrupted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=37.04s)]
*  for what we've done so that we can never provoke [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  this kind of horrifying violence ever again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=41.28s)]
*  That's the real lesson of this mass shooting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=43.84s)]
*  So that is what they've been telling you again [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=47.16s)]
*  and again and again on various news channels [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=49.24s)]
*  for the past three days. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  And we're not overstating that by the way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=52.24s)]
*  Here's a selection of it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=54.2s)]
*  It's a campaign being driven by members of Congress [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=56.56s)]
*  and conservative influencers on social media, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  as well as the right's most favorite TV network, Fox News. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  Those incidents at drag events I mentioned a few moments ago, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  they happened within the context of conservative media [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=68.36s)]
*  personalities fear mongering against queer folks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=70.76s)]
*  Respected messengers from TV networks saying [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=73.4s)]
*  that these people are wrong [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=76.84s)]
*  and they're trying to damage your children. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  We have a long history of the LGBTQ community [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  being victimized, demonized by, especially right-wing media [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  and Republicans. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  You have anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed on the most watched hours [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=93.72s)]
*  on Fox News at a regular clip against the US military, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=99.0s)]
*  against gay men and women, against gay teachers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  against their right to exist. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=106.36s)]
*  So Fox News in its most watched hours [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=108.52s)]
*  is attacking even the US military [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=111.16s)]
*  and of course, gay men and women and teachers too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=113.08s)]
*  They're advocating, quote, against their right to exist. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=115.88s)]
*  In other words, they've been calling for genocide. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=118.6s)]
*  That would be us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=121.08s)]
*  Now that's a stout claim, but no one has made it more often [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=123.0s)]
*  than NBC News. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=125.72s)]
*  In particular, it's two self-described [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=127.0s)]
*  disinformation reporters, Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrosny. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=129.56s)]
*  These two are outraged that anyone would dare criticize [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=135.0s)]
*  the genital mutilation of children [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  or drag shows for fifth graders [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=141.16s)]
*  or creepy weirdo teachers explaining the mechanics [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=143.32s)]
*  of oral sex to nine-year-olds. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  Pointing out that any of that is happening is hate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  and it gets people killed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=151.24s)]
*  Here's a highly emotional Ben Collins of NBC News [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=153.16s)]
*  making that very point yesterday morning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=156.2s)]
*  Fueled by the internet's far-right machine, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=165.48s)]
*  anti-LGBTQ threats shut down trans rights and drag events. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=167.72s)]
*  Remember, there was a drag event happening in Colorado. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=171.0s)]
*  Well, what do we do about public officials [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  at local level, state level, federal level [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=177.4s)]
*  who try to inject the fear of the very word transgender [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=181.4s)]
*  into school issues? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=185.32s)]
*  They get more clicks for it and they end up on Tucker Carlson. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=186.84s)]
*  They end up on the highest rated show on cable news. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=189.0s)]
*  And last night, by the way, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=190.84s)]
*  Tucker attacked my colleague, Brandy Zadrosny, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  who was co-bailing on almost all of these stories. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  Not me, he attacked Brandy, of course, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  but he attacked Brandy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=199.72s)]
*  And he went right back into this idea [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  that some they is trying to groom your kids, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  trying to sexualize your children, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=207.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=209.4s)]
*  Who's the they, first of all? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  And second of all, all of her reporting was right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=212.44s)]
*  All of it was right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=215.8s)]
*  Oh, it's all about me, of course, says Ben Collins. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=216.6s)]
*  But more to the point, how dare anyone [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=222.12s)]
*  criticize the august disinformation reporter [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=224.04s)]
*  and former college librarian Brandy Zadrosny [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=227.0s)]
*  because as Ben Collins pointed out, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=229.88s)]
*  her reporting was right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=231.24s)]
*  Well, since you brought it up, Ben Collins, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=233.64s)]
*  was her reporting right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=235.32s)]
*  Well, not entirely. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=237.16s)]
*  Do you remember when Brandy Zadrosny told you [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=238.76s)]
*  several hundred times that the accused shooter [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=240.84s)]
*  Anderson Lee Aldrich was inspired by hatred [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=242.76s)]
*  for the non-binary community that he learned on this show? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=244.84s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=247.32s)]
*  Well, actually, it turns out, we discovered last night, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=248.76s)]
*  that Anderson Lee Aldrich is, drum roll please, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  part of the non-binary community. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=254.44s)]
*  He doesn't hate them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=256.92s)]
*  He is one. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=258.2s)]
*  In a court filing, Aldrich's lawyers wrote this, quote, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=259.48s)]
*  Anderson Aldrich is non-binary. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=262.04s)]
*  They use they, them pronouns, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=264.92s)]
*  and for the purposes of all former filings, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=266.68s)]
*  will be addressed as Mix Aldrich. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=268.76s)]
*  Mix Aldrich. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=272.36s)]
*  That's the shooter, the non-binary shooter. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=273.32s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=276.44s)]
*  First, get your chuckling under control [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=278.84s)]
*  and ponder what this means. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=280.28s)]
*  What it means is that virtually everything [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=281.8s)]
*  that NBC News has told you about this shooting in Colorado [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=284.28s)]
*  is not only wrong, it is the opposite of the truth. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=287.88s)]
*  It is all a grotesque and filthy lie. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=291.88s)]
*  It wasn't news reporting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=296.44s)]
*  It turns out to have been the most transparent sort [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=298.76s)]
*  of political propaganda. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=301.32s)]
*  And for once, they have been busted flat out in public, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=302.92s)]
*  trying to sell political propaganda [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=306.84s)]
*  to an unsuspecting public under the guise of news. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=308.44s)]
*  It's not the first time they've done it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=312.2s)]
*  They won't stop doing it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=313.96s)]
*  Oh, but they did it a lot in this case. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=315.32s)]
*  Here's another clip, another instance of Ben Collins [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  trying to once again pass off political slogans as news. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=320.6s)]
*  There are five dead people in a strip mall [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=325.24s)]
*  because that was the only place they felt safe [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=328.36s)]
*  as gay or trans people in this town in Colorado Springs. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=330.2s)]
*  He's emotional telling you that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=335.32s)]
*  There are five dead people in a strip mall [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=336.92s)]
*  because that was the only place they felt safe [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=338.84s)]
*  as gay or trans people in this town of Colorado Springs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=341.0s)]
*  So it turns out it's the town's fault too [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=344.12s)]
*  because there are a lot of Christians, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=346.52s)]
*  everybody knows, in Colorado Springs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=348.2s)]
*  So gay people feel terrified there [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=350.44s)]
*  because Christians are dangerous. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=352.28s)]
*  And all these terrified gay people [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=354.76s)]
*  were huddled together for safety [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=356.2s)]
*  when this Fox News-addled anti-trans bigot [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=357.64s)]
*  walked in and started shooting them for being trans folk. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=359.88s)]
*  That was Ben Collins' quote reporting. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=363.4s)]
*  Well, the only problem is not all the victims were gay. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=367.0s)]
*  One of them, at least one of them, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=369.08s)]
*  was at the club with his girlfriend. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=370.04s)]
*  Oh, details, details. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=371.64s)]
*  Ben Collins doesn't let details get in the way [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=373.64s)]
*  of an effective political attack. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=375.64s)]
*  And it would have been an effective political attack [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=376.84s)]
*  had not reality interceded. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=378.68s)]
*  But he doesn't care. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  Now there's the White House. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=382.52s)]
*  Here's the White House telling you [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  that because a non-binary person shut up a gay bar, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=384.92s)]
*  you can't own a gun. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=387.32s)]
*  This attack also comes amidst a rise in violent rhetoric [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=390.04s)]
*  and threats against the LGBTQI plus people across the country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=394.04s)]
*  While we don't know yet for certain the motive of this attack, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=399.32s)]
*  hate has no place in this country [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=403.8s)]
*  and neither do military-style assault rifles, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=406.52s)]
*  which is why we will continue to push for an assault weapons ban. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=410.84s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=416.28s)]
*  You found the reasoning. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=417.08s)]
*  So when the trans community opens fire on itself, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=417.8s)]
*  we need an assault weapons ban. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  Because why? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=421.24s)]
*  Because you're a hater. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=421.88s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg, of course, couldn't pass up a moment like this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=423.64s)]
*  It's not like Pete Buttigieg wants to talk about [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=427.48s)]
*  how things are going over at the transportation department, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=429.32s)]
*  which he supposedly runs. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=431.48s)]
*  Short answer, not well. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  No, Pete Buttigieg wants to talk about identity. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=434.76s)]
*  He always wants to talk about identity. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=437.32s)]
*  And the funny ironic thing is, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=439.56s)]
*  in the tell just a few years ago, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=441.8s)]
*  Buttigieg wouldn't even admit that he was gay. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=443.16s)]
*  He hid that and then lied about it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=445.72s)]
*  for reasons he has never been asked to explain. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=447.56s)]
*  Why not? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=450.36s)]
*  Now he is happy to use his sexual orientation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=451.16s)]
*  as a cudgel to bash you repeatedly in the face into submission. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=454.04s)]
*  Quote, here's the latest. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  If you're a politician or media figure [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=459.72s)]
*  who sets up the LGBTQ community to be hated and feared, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  not because any of us have ever harmed you, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=465.16s)]
*  but because you find it useful, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=466.68s)]
*  then don't you dare act surprised when this kind of violence follows. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  Don't you dare act surprised. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=471.8s)]
*  Don't you dare. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=473.88000000000005s)]
*  All right, fair enough, we won't dare. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=475.24s)]
*  But honestly, we're a little surprised [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  to learn that the anti-trans shooter is himself trans. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=479.16s)]
*  Were you surprised by that, Pete Buttigieg, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=482.92s)]
*  now that you're admitting you're gay after lying about it? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  Since we're talking about identity, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=487.88s)]
*  what do you have to say about that? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=489.32s)]
*  Well, nothing, weirdly. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg hasn't said anything. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  Nor has he apologized for attacking other people on false pretenses. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=493.48s)]
*  Guess who else hasn't apologized? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=498.76s)]
*  Ben Collins or Brandy Z. Drozni. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  Yesterday, they were accusing us of getting five people murdered. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=502.92s)]
*  Now that the story they were telling has turned out to be a lie, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  the opposite of what they said it was, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=508.6s)]
*  they're pretending that nothing has changed at all. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=510.76s)]
*  Oh, they are liars. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  Cold-blooded liars. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=515.24s)]
*  It's amazing to watch. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=516.44s)]
*  And so is the company they work for. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=517.88s)]
*  NBC News just ran this article. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=519.64s)]
*  After we know that the shooter was himself trans, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=521.24s)]
*  they ran this headline with a straight face. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  Quote, right-wing influencers and media double down on anti-LGBTQ [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=525.48s)]
*  rhetoric in the wake of the Colorado shooting. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=531.0s)]
*  Can you imagine writing that, knowing what we know? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=534.28s)]
*  They had no problem with it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=536.44s)]
*  Then an editor at NBC called Benjamin Goggin added this, quote, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=537.48s)]
*  If the shooter is non-binary, it doesn't change the fact [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=540.68s)]
*  the right-wing media is continuing to stoke hatred towards LGBTQ people [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=544.52s)]
*  after five people were killed at a gay bar. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=549.08s)]
*  Right. So it's hatred. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=551.72s)]
*  So if you're against genital mutilation of children [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=554.76s)]
*  or bringing toddlers to drag shows, you're against the LGBTQ community. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=559.08s)]
*  Well, of course, that's insane. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=563.64s)]
*  There's nothing anti-gay about that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=566.36s)]
*  Most gay people aren't in favor of genital mutilation [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  or bringing toddlers to drag shows. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=571.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with those opinions. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=574.2s)]
*  They're the right opinions, and all decent people understand that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  What is indecent, what is wrong, is lying about a mass shooting, which NBC did. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=578.44s)]
*  So how are the rest of the media handling this? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=584.6s)]
*  Well, CNN, for its part, is just denying that the shooter is really non-binary. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=586.28s)]
*  It couldn't be. It couldn't be. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  It just couldn't be true. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=592.92s)]
*  So they've decided to continue misgendering Micks Aldrich. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=599.9599999999999s)]
*  So in this case, if the shooter claims to be non-binary, he's got to be lying about it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=616.28s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=642.8399999999999s)]
*  So we're not going to call the non-binary shooter Micks or observe his pronoun request. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=644.36s)]
*  In fact, the whole pronoun thing is gone. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  Biology is back. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=651.08s)]
*  He was born a man. He's still a man. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=652.84s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=657.0s)]
*  So what they're doing, of course, is using an actual tragedy, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=657.96s)]
*  the murder of five people, for political reasons. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=661.0s)]
*  And of course, it's not the first time they have done that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=665.0s)]
*  They're happy to use death for political advantage. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=667.4s)]
*  They did it with George Floyd. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=670.0400000000001s)]
*  They did it with Officer Brian Sicknick. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=671.4s)]
*  And it's not the most recent anti-gay attack, by the way, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  that has turned out to be a total lie perpetuated by the media. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=677.24s)]
*  Just a few days ago, a guy was caught throwing a rock at a gay bar [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=679.96s)]
*  in Hell's Kitchen, New York, on camera. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  So the media, due to flun out, interviewed the owner who said, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=686.9200000000001s)]
*  quote, it feels like yet another manifestation of hate against our community. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=689.32s)]
*  A lot of big social media accounts ran with that story. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=693.4s)]
*  More hate. More hate. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=695.88s)]
*  So then, and this is a story that didn't get quite as much coverage, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  the police arrested the guy who did it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=700.28s)]
*  His name is Sean Cullian, and he was upset because of a dispute involving a friend. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=702.76s)]
*  He didn't target the place because it's a gay bar. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=708.04s)]
*  In fact, and we're quoting now from the rock thrower, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=710.2s)]
*  I'm gay myself. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=714.2s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=716.68s)]
*  Shouldn't someone apologize? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=718.36s)]
*  Shouldn't someone admit that they got the facts wrong [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  and slandered half the country on the basis of wrong facts? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=724.6s)]
*  Now, never admit it. Never apologize. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=727.72s)]
*  Keep moving on. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=729.64s)]
*  Pick another story to beat you in the head with. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwRCI0HeWQ&t=730.52s)]
