# Tucker: These are the moral priorities of the Democrats
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, so much going on in your government, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=3.36s)]
*  it's very hard to keep track, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=5.96s)]
*  even if you're paid to do it as we are. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Here's one interesting thing that nobody noticed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=9.96s)]
*  On Saturday, some unnamed actor, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=11.52s)]
*  some sub training and vermin in the House of Representatives [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  inserted what turned out to be a remarkable provision [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=18.12s)]
*  into the so-called budget reconciliation bill. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=20.92s)]
*  Almost nobody outside the Congress noticed it was there [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=24.28s)]
*  and that's really not surprising. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=27.04s)]
*  The bill is one of the biggest in all of human history. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=28.779999999999998s)]
*  It's nearly 2,500 pages long. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=31.7s)]
*  It spends $3.5 trillion. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=34.64s)]
*  Where does that money come from? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  Well, it was just newly printed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=39.58s)]
*  by the Federal Reserve for the occasion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=41.22s)]
*  The provision in question was hidden on page 168 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=43.7s)]
*  of that bill and here's what it says. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Going forward, the federal government will bankrupt [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=50.08s)]
*  any company that refuses to comply [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=52.4s)]
*  with Joe Biden's vaccine mandate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=54.2s)]
*  So do you have an unvaccinated worker in your office? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=57.26s)]
*  The fine for that will be $700,000 payable [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  to the US Treasury for each and every one of those workers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  Even by the standards of Washington, that is a lot of money. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=69.5s)]
*  Here's a comparison. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=72.46s)]
*  In June, the federal government penalized [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=73.74s)]
*  a chemical company in West Virginia [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=75.86s)]
*  after its plant exploded, killing an employee [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  and sending two others to the hospital. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=80.7s)]
*  The fine in that case, $12,288. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=83.06s)]
*  So there you have it written out in black and white [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=87.98s)]
*  the moral priorities of the Democratic party. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=90.58s)]
*  Killing people in chemical plants is bad. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  It's about $12,000 bad, but failing to get [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=96.0s)]
*  a Joe Biden mandated COVID vaccine, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=99.5s)]
*  even if you've already recovered from COVID [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  and have natural immunity that is more powerful [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=103.42s)]
*  than any shot, that's much, much worse. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=105.36s)]
*  How much worse? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=108.38s)]
*  It is 58 times worse than killing people [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=109.6s)]
*  in a chemical plant explosion. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=113.0s)]
*  Democrats did the math on that and they wrote it down. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=114.52s)]
*  This whole approach, if you take three steps back to COVID [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=118.28s)]
*  is a little weird when you think about it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=121.24s)]
*  If you really wanted to protect the public, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  the American people from this virus, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  the first thing you would do is encourage them to be healthy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=128.5s)]
*  Meaning get off your phone, get outside, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=131.92s)]
*  spend some time in nature, maybe lose some weight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=134.16s)]
*  That's meaningful. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  That all works. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=138.26s)]
*  We know it for a fact. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=139.1s)]
*  It's science. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=140.34s)]
*  And then people with higher risk factors like older people, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=142.2s)]
*  people with preexisting medical problems [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  would probably wanna get the vaccine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  Definitely worth it for them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=149.54s)]
*  They should. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  Everyone else could look at the numbers and assess. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=151.64s)]
*  They could choose for themselves [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  as they do with every other medical decision. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  The federal government is not requiring you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=160.16s)]
*  to get surgery for prostate cancer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  If you get it, no, you get to decide. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=164.98s)]
*  So that would be a reasonable response to COVID. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=169.1s)]
*  It might actually improve the country rather than destroy it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=171.22s)]
*  But that's very far from what they're actually doing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=175.06s)]
*  And the reason is politics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=177.46s)]
*  From the beginning of the outbreak, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=179.3s)]
*  politicians have turned what they told us [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=180.78s)]
*  was a public health response [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  into something that very much looks like a political campaign. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=184.46s)]
*  And in a political campaign, the other side is your enemy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=187.18s)]
*  So all of a sudden the public has become an opponent [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  that politicians must subdue and defeat. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  How do you feel about opponents [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=197.56s)]
*  you are working to subdue and defeat? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=199.0s)]
*  Well, you feel loathing and contempt. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=201.52s)]
*  And that's how they do feel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=203.56s)]
*  They're not hiding it anymore. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=204.88s)]
*  Take a look at this video, which we just got. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=206.88s)]
*  It's from yesterday. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=208.68s)]
*  It shows a Democratic congresswoman from Iowa [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=209.84s)]
*  called Cindy Axne. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=212.32s)]
*  And she's explaining her party's response to COVID. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=213.76s)]
*  She doesn't say anything that remarkable. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=216.88s)]
*  It's how she says it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=219.44s)]
*  Listen to how she talks about her constituents. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=221.22s)]
*  She so clearly hates them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=223.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=225.52s)]
*  So now all the schools are back [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=226.36s)]
*  wanting to put mask mandates in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=228.12s)]
*  and all the anti-vaxxer crazies are out there with their, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=230.44000000000003s)]
*  you know, it's a hot mess. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=234.56s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=236.8s)]
*  You know, Christian right is, you know, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  the everything under the guise while they hold a cross [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  and, you know, for God or whatever. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=244.68s)]
*  And they use it like a weapon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=246.8s)]
*  And it's painful to watch [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  because they've weaponized religion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=250.82000000000002s)]
*  They've weaponized politics. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=254.6s)]
*  Yeah, the Christians are weaponizing it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=258.6s)]
*  Notice all the abortion clinics they closed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=261.04s)]
*  Oh no, it was Democratic politicians [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=262.8s)]
*  who closed the churches actually. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=264.76s)]
*  Speaking of weaponizing public health. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=267.44s)]
*  But you just heard the congresswoman, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=270.52s)]
*  the anti-vaxxer crazies, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=271.92s)]
*  the Christians holding a cross for God or whatever. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=273.64s)]
*  It's hard to remember those are actually human beings [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=277.96s)]
*  she's talking about. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=280.5s)]
*  Some of the weakest human beings in our country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=281.34s)]
*  But she would never know they're real people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=285.44s)]
*  because she clearly loathes them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=287.28s)]
*  She hates them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=289.88s)]
*  You hear this tone a lot from politicians all of a sudden. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  A lot. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=294.32s)]
*  It's not sympathy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  Certainly not empathy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not even a sincere attempt to make people better [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  or healthier. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=302.0s)]
*  It's hate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  Here's the mayor of New York threatening to hurt anyone [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=305.56s)]
*  who doesn't get the shot, whether they need it or not. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=307.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=310.0s)]
*  Most people, the vast majority of people, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=310.84s)]
*  say I didn't want to get vaccinated, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=312.8s)]
*  make a different decision when it becomes very, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=315.64s)]
*  very practical. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=318.36s)]
*  So now someone is literally looking at the possibility [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=319.28s)]
*  they won't have a paycheck for a prolonged period of time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=323.5s)]
*  They may even lose their job ultimately. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=326.4s)]
*  A lot of people are gonna look at that and say, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=328.96s)]
*  hold up, okay, I'll get vaccinated. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=330.32s)]
*  Oh, we'll take your paycheck away. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=333.56s)]
*  We'll just punch you in the face or starve you to death. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=336.64s)]
*  We want to beat up your kids. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  Turns out if you hurt people enough, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=340.88s)]
*  they will do exactly what you say. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  So that actually works. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=346.2s)]
*  Bill de Blasio is clearly a moron, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=347.68s)]
*  but even he understands that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=349.86s)]
*  And it does work. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=352.12s)]
*  United Airlines just announced it is firing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=352.94s)]
*  nearly 600 people. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=355.04s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=357.32s)]
*  Well, they don't want to pay tens of millions [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=358.28s)]
*  of dollars in fines. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=359.84s)]
*  So now 600 people who last week worked United Airlines [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=361.48s)]
*  are unemployed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=364.84s)]
*  Oh, by the way, they have no health insurance. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=366.12s)]
*  That's how we're making America healthier. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  Got it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=370.16s)]
*  And it's not just happening in the airlines. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=371.88000000000005s)]
*  In hospitals across the country, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  mass firings are now underway. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=375.12s)]
*  Where's the Congress in this? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=378.0s)]
*  Good question. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=378.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, one hospital system in North Carolina [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=380.36s)]
*  just canned 175 people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=382.12s)]
*  Remember, this is a public health crisis [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  we're living through, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=388.18s)]
*  So maybe we shouldn't empty the hospitals [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=389.04s)]
*  of their seasoned employees. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=391.06s)]
*  It was already nationwide a severe shortage of nurses. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  Hospitals are closing wings [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  because there's no one to staff them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  And now there are fewer people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  None of the people who've been fired [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=401.72s)]
*  will be able to collect unemployment, by the way. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  They're done, they're destroyed. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=404.36s)]
*  They're not just punished, they're crushed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  And these aren't the CEOs of big companies. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  These aren't people who live in affluent neighborhoods. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=412.2s)]
*  These are hourly workers. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=414.36s)]
*  These are people the Democratic Party used to care about. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  These are people with no power whatsoever [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=418.94s)]
*  who worked around sick people [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  for the duration of a deadly pandemic. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=423.6s)]
*  And rather than thank them, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=426.98s)]
*  we're firing them with no unemployment benefits [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=428.44s)]
*  and no health insurance. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=431.04s)]
*  And a lot of them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=432.76s)]
*  State of New York, for example, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  the deadline for healthcare workers to get vaccinated [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=434.82s)]
*  is already passed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=436.92s)]
*  According to the most recent figures, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=438.52s)]
*  16% of the state's hospital workers, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=440.0s)]
*  that is 83,000 people remain unvaccinated. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=442.24s)]
*  8% of those workers have not gotten [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=446.6s)]
*  a single dose of the vaccine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  That means they're going to be fired. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=449.76s)]
*  So the question is, once again, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=451.96s)]
*  who's going to staff the hospitals [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=453.64s)]
*  in the middle of this public health crisis? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=456.16s)]
*  Well, that's an easy answer, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=458.48s)]
*  according to the new government of New York, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=459.76s)]
*  the one no one voted for. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=461.04s)]
*  The state of New York is going to use the military to do it [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=462.4s)]
*  and then hire temp workers from the Philippines. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=464.52s)]
*  It's lunacy. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=468.6s)]
*  And by the way, once again, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=470.24s)]
*  why exactly are all these healthcare workers, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=472.32s)]
*  thousands of them nationwide, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=474.96s)]
*  refusing to get the COVID vaccine? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=476.96s)]
*  That is an entirely fair question and no one is asking it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=479.64s)]
*  It might be worth finding out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=484.32s)]
*  You can't say these are people [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=487.08s)]
*  who don't understand the science. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  In fact, they might know more about COVID and healthcare [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=488.76s)]
*  than your average democratic governor, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=491.2s)]
*  considering that's what they do for a living. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=493.56s)]
*  They treat people with COVID every single day. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=496.0s)]
*  So it's not like they're uninformed. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  What is this exactly? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=501.52s)]
*  It's not a few people, it's thousands of people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  Why? No one cares. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=506.44s)]
*  Punish them, the weakest, now crushed. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, as we're firing nurses and doctors, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=513.6s)]
*  we're admitting thousands of illegal immigrants [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=515.48s)]
*  into this country right now, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=517.52s)]
*  many of them infected with diseases, including COVID. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=518.48s)]
*  You're not supposed to say that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  because it's some sort of slur, but it's factually true. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=523.84s)]
*  In fact, not only is it true, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=529.08s)]
*  the Secretary of Homeland Security just admitted it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=532.0s)]
*  He explained that 20% of the people [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=534.44s)]
*  coming across the border [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=536.6s)]
*  have an unidentified illness of some kind. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=538.08s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=540.2s)]
*  We are confronted with a population of people [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=541.6s)]
*  that as a general matter [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=547.48s)]
*  have a rate of illness of approximately 20%. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=552.36s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=560.16s)]
*  So we're firing healthcare workers [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=562.6s)]
*  because they won't get the vaccine [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=565.16s)]
*  and then letting in thousands of people [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=566.96s)]
*  whose identities we can't verify, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=569.0s)]
*  who are sick with diseases we can't always identify, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=571.2s)]
*  including COVID. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=574.68s)]
*  None of them are required to get the vaccine [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=576.04s)]
*  in contrast to the nurses we just fired. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=578.24s)]
*  That leaves our hospitals short-staffed, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=581.28s)]
*  many more sick people coming in [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=583.96s)]
*  who will need treatment at public expense. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=585.8s)]
*  Who's doing this and why? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=589.8s)]
*  What is the point? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=592.92s)]
*  They're telling us that healthcare workers [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=595.0s)]
*  need to be fired immediately [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=596.72s)]
*  because they're a threat to the country? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=597.96s)]
*  This is all happening very, very quickly [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=601.28s)]
*  and it's happening without any medical basis whatsoever. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=603.28s)]
*  Remember it was just last year [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=607.16s)]
*  that Joe Biden was telling us [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=608.12s)]
*  that healthcare workers are heroes and he was right. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=609.4s)]
*  To all the doctors and nurses working in the ICU units, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=613.08s)]
*  hope you all know you're truly some of the greatest heroes [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=617.12s)]
*  this nation has seen. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=619.84s)]
*  Take Tracy in Massachusetts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=621.8s)]
*  She's a nurse who's been treating veterans with COVID-19. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=623.88s)]
*  Every day she's had to put on a hazmat suit [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=628.0s)]
*  and go to work for 12 hours, days on end. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=631.9599999999999s)]
*  If it wasn't for folks like Tracy, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=634.5999999999999s)]
*  our own families wouldn't have a chance to be reunited. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  We wanna find a hero in America, they're all around us. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=639.52s)]
*  Tracy's one of them. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  Don't often endorse Joe Biden videos, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  but that's 100% right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=647.76s)]
*  Anyone who's ever been sick [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=649.04s)]
*  and had ever spent any time in the hospital [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=650.52s)]
*  knows that one good nurse makes all the difference. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  They really are some of the best people in the country. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=654.36s)]
*  So why are we firing thousands of them? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=658.4s)]
*  Why is Joe Biden doing this? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=660.08s)]
*  As a scientific matter, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=661.76s)]
*  Unvaccinated healthcare workers do not pose a threat [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=664.48s)]
*  to their vaccinated patients or coworkers, period. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=666.96s)]
*  If you're vaccinated, you will likely be fine. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=670.6s)]
*  That's what the data show. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=673.12s)]
*  That's what they tell us day after day. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=674.36s)]
*  Vaccinated people have a greater chance [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=676.2800000000001s)]
*  of dying from a lightning strike [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=677.8000000000001s)]
*  than they do of dying from COVID. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  They're more likely to die of a bee sting or a dog attack [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=680.24s)]
*  or from choking to death in their food. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=682.24s)]
*  Those are the numbers we hear them very often. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=683.88s)]
*  So why are unvaccinated people a threat to them? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=686.56s)]
*  Not one person has answered that question. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=690.16s)]
*  No one's even asking it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=692.8s)]
*  Why are we firing them? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=695.88s)]
*  Why are we blaming them? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=697.04s)]
*  Why are we in their face attacking them, demonizing them? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=698.28s)]
*  But no one's pushing back, so it's accelerating. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=704.28s)]
*  This is coming to the border patrol as well. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=706.56s)]
*  It's coming to the entire federal government. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  Mass firings are likely to occur [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=709.76s)]
*  in the border patrol's ranks [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=711.64s)]
*  when the federal government's vaccine mandate [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=712.76s)]
*  is enforced later this year. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=714.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  But if there's one sad lesson, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  maybe the saddest lesson of this pandemic, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=720.28s)]
*  it's that authoritarianism is very popular [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=722.0s)]
*  with certain parts of the population. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=724.8399999999999s)]
*  And if you need evidence of that, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  take a look at the scene last night [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  in the New Jersey gubernatorial debate. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=729.7199999999999s)]
*  Listen to the crowd's reaction as Phil Murphy [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=732.76s)]
*  equates not getting the COVID shot to drunk driving. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=736.2399999999999s)]
*  Saying that it's your call [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=740.68s)]
*  and governments can't mandate a vaccine [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=742.04s)]
*  or no masking is akin to supporting drunk driving. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=745.04s)]
*  It impacts both the person who's driving drunk, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=749.36s)]
*  but all the rest of us. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=752.08s)]
*  That's not the way we beat this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=753.96s)]
*  How is it like drunk driving? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=757.12s)]
*  How do unvaccinated people hurt anybody? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=758.72s)]
*  Hey, Phil Murphy, got a second? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=761.2s)]
*  We've got some time. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=763.72s)]
*  Why don't you explain that to us? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=764.56s)]
*  It was just a year ago or so [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=766.84s)]
*  that a politician who got on stage and said that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=768.36s)]
*  would be laughed off the stage. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=770.68s)]
*  And a politician who endorsed firing thousands [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=772.92s)]
*  of healthcare workers during a pandemic, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=775.4s)]
*  calling them criminals, dehumanizing them, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=778.04s)]
*  would be reviled. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=781.36s)]
*  Now it gets applause. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=782.64s)]
*  Not because the science has changed, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=784.56s)]
*  the science is the same. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=786.16s)]
*  It's because our leaders realized how to leverage fear [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=787.72s)]
*  to crush their political opponents. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=790.8s)]
*  And if that means finding people $700,000 [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=792.92s)]
*  for employing someone, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=796.56s)]
*  throwing the weakest people in our society [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=798.44s)]
*  out on the street with no unemployment insurance [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=800.56s)]
*  and no health insurance, they'll do it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhNaELdPH4s&t=804.5999999999999s)]
