# Cassy Garcia slams NY Times for 'far-right Latina' label
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk)
*  Ever notice how when you criticize a white liberal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=0.0s)]
*  they call you racist? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=2.06s)]
*  And you think to yourself, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=3.36s)]
*  no, no, no, I'm criticizing you, the white liberal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=4.2s)]
*  Racist! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=6.44s)]
*  Ha ha ha, it's hilarious. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=7.28s)]
*  But it's their first and last defense, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=10.0s)]
*  hiding behind other people of other ethnicities [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=11.6s)]
*  to push through their preferred policies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=15.92s)]
*  And on no subject, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=19.32s)]
*  because it's more obvious than on immigration, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=20.16s)]
*  for years now, journalists have told us [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=21.96s)]
*  that Hispanic voters, not that they've met any, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=23.92s)]
*  love open borders. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=26.6s)]
*  And if you don't, you're a racist. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=29.04s)]
*  So all of a sudden, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  there's some cognitive dissonance going on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=33.08s)]
*  because Hispanic voters [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=34.96s)]
*  actually don't seem to love open borders. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=37.8s)]
*  And that's why in overwhelming Hispanic districts, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  you're seeing Republicans getting elected [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=42.24s)]
*  who are promising to enforce immigration law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=44.6s)]
*  So the New York Times is extremely upset about this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  They're trying to figure out what exactly happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=48.84s)]
*  These voters aren't as obedient as we thought they would be. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=50.92s)]
*  They don't have the same attitudes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=53.36s)]
*  that we do here in Williamsburg. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=54.44s)]
*  Like, what the hell? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=56.08s)]
*  And so they found a scapegoat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=57.88s)]
*  They just published an article with a headline, quote, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=59.24s)]
*  "'The Rise of the Far-Right Latina.'" [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=61.52s)]
*  Far-Right Latina with, well, that's our kind of guest. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  One of those that they referred to is Cassie Garcia, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  who's running for Congress in Texas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=69.88s)]
*  And we are grateful that she's joining us tonight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  Cassie Garcia, I don't know what a far-right Latina is, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=73.8s)]
*  but I am glad. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=76.56s)]
*  It's a badge of honor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=79.08s)]
*  The New York Times doesn't like you, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=79.92s)]
*  and we are very happy to have you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=81.2s)]
*  So now they're attacking you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  because you don't have their views. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=84.76s)]
*  Is that what's happening? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=87.26s)]
*  Well, Tucker, thank you for having me on tonight. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=88.98s)]
*  It's just absolutely ridiculous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  The fact that the liberal media would call me [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=92.78s)]
*  a far-right Latina because I grew up [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=95.34s)]
*  in a conservative household on the border [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=97.5s)]
*  and I went to church is just absolutely ridiculous. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=99.98s)]
*  Yet they praise AOC and the Squad. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=103.5s)]
*  Let me tell you, they don't represent our values [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  in South Texas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  And the reason why I am running for Congress [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=109.9s)]
*  is to defend faith, family, and freedom. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=112.18s)]
*  District 28 has been in Democrat control [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=114.26s)]
*  for 110 years, and the current incumbent, Henry Quare, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  who says all the right things, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=120.18s)]
*  has done absolutely nothing, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=121.58s)]
*  nothing to secure a southern border. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=123.5s)]
*  In fact, I have received the endorsement [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  for the National Border Patrol Council, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  who's always endorsed Henry Quare, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=129.1s)]
*  but they've endorsed me in this race [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=130.46s)]
*  for Congressional District 28. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=132.86s)]
*  I just think it's a little bit, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=135.82s)]
*  I mean, do you think it's weird that some, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=136.66s)]
*  you know, white liberal from the Upper West Side [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  who went to Brown and sends his kids [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=142.66s)]
*  to Riverdale Country School gets to speak [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=144.3s)]
*  for Hispanic voters on the Mexican border in Texas? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=146.58s)]
*  Like where do they get the right to decide [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=150.06s)]
*  what you're allowed to believe? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=152.66000000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm representing the families [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  and the communities of District 28 [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=157.38000000000002s)]
*  and they don't speak for me, the New York Times. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=158.74s)]
*  The Democrat party has left the Hispanic community [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  and in the Hispanic community, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=163.5s)]
*  we care about a strong and secure border. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, we don't want open borders at all. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  And that's what the Democrat party believes in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=170.22000000000003s)]
*  and we don't believe in that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=172.9s)]
*  We believe in sovereign borders. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=174.86s)]
*  And so that's why we're gonna see more Democrats vote, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=177.06s)]
*  Republican come this November. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=180.34s)]
*  We're gonna see more Democrats walk away. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=181.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're obviously an American, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=183.94000000000003s)]
*  but I think even immigrants who just got here [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=185.86s)]
*  of any background don't want open borders. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=187.86s)]
*  Why would you want to come to a country [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=189.58s)]
*  that's not really a country? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=190.86s)]
*  Of course, duh. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=191.9s)]
*  Cassie Garcia, we're glad to meet you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSBzveX_uk&t=193.46s)]
