# Kyle Rittenhouse: This double standard is not OK
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0)
*  But first to the case of Daniel Perry in Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=0.0s)]
*  Perry's an army sergeant who was driving for Uber in Austin [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=3.0s)]
*  during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  A mob surrounded his car in the middle of the street. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=9.0s)]
*  And we know this because parts of what happened next [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=10.8s)]
*  are captured on video. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=13.8s)]
*  One rioter closed in and raised his AK-47 [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=15.48s)]
*  in Perry's direction. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=19.04s)]
*  Perry responded to the threat to his life, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  shot and killed the man in self-defense. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  The local DA, Soros Bakht, charged Perry [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  with murder for that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=29.48s)]
*  And last week, Perry was convicted. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=30.76s)]
*  Daniel Perry's family in shock, crying over the fact [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=34.36s)]
*  that he had just been convicted of murder [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=37.52s)]
*  for killing protester Garrett Foster in 2020. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=39.76s)]
*  Perry himself, unable to hide his emotion, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=43.08s)]
*  hugging his attorney as he cried. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=50.36s)]
*  State, is there a motion? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=52.56s)]
*  The state wasting no time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=55.32s)]
*  Jury, I'm asking that the defendant be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=57.12s)]
*  remanded into custody at this time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=58.6s)]
*  Perry was turned over into the custody of the Travis County [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=60.8s)]
*  Sheriff's Office, handcuffed instantly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=63.72s)]
*  So you're not allowed to defend yourself against BLM rioters, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=68.28s)]
*  even when they point a rifle at you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=71.48s)]
*  That's the lesson. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  But of course, that lesson is incompatible with justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=74.32s)]
*  And so to his credit, the governor of Texas, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=77.28s)]
*  Greg Abbott, has announced that he will pardon Daniel Perry. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=79.36s)]
*  It's a little more complicated in Texas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=82.24s)]
*  Perry is behind bars tonight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=84.2s)]
*  But the governor has instructed the pardons board [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=86.92s)]
*  to work on an expedited review. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=89.28s)]
*  That's required by law in Texas in order [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=91.08s)]
*  for a pardon to occur. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=93.56s)]
*  But he is pardoning this man. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=95.08s)]
*  That is obviously the right thing to do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=97.16s)]
*  George Soros can't pay for people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=99.28s)]
*  to put his political opponents in jail [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=100.84s)]
*  and then have a Republican governor ignore it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=105.72s)]
*  But of course, Democrats think he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  should be convicted of murder because one of their voters [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=108.56s)]
*  got killed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=111.68s)]
*  Now, everyone involved in this was the same color, white. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=112.64s)]
*  But of course, Greg Abbott is a racist for some reason [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=116.64s)]
*  for pardoning Perry. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=119.56s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=120.64s)]
*  I understand what Abbott is doing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=122.8s)]
*  So much of this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=124.68s)]
*  Go back to Galveston, Texas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=125.64s)]
*  And you're going to find out what happened. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=127.92s)]
*  Remember, it was in Texas that Black folks were [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=130.24s)]
*  kept in slavery over two years after they had been freed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=132.88s)]
*  This is what we're dealing with in this country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=137.16s)]
*  This is why you ended up having a Black Lives Matter [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=139.12s)]
*  protest in the first place. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=141.84s)]
*  Seemingly, the Republicans do not believe [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=143.0s)]
*  in being hard on crime when it comes to certain folks, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=145.2s)]
*  Seemingly, they only want to be hard on crime [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=150.0s)]
*  when they are poor, when they are Black, when they are brown. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=152.32s)]
*  If Daniel Perry gets pardoned for murder in Texas, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  it'll really only be because he killed the right kind of person, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=159.2s)]
*  the person that Brightwings don't care about. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  That is a Black Lives Matter protestor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=164.2s)]
*  But the guy who was shot was white. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, Congressman Clyburn [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=170.88s)]
*  does not get the credit that he deserves [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=172.48s)]
*  for being completely dishonest, ignoble, and also totally [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  corrupt. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  He was promoting his daughter for government jobs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  So the Texas Pardons Board is now [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  reviewing Daniel Perry's pardon. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  They're not watching MSNBC, we hope. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  But we wanted to speak to one of the few people who [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=190.72s)]
*  knows tonight what Daniel Perry is going through, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=192.76s)]
*  sitting behind bars for defending himself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse lived that experience. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=199.76s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=201.68s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=202.84s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Tucker. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=205.44s)]
*  So here you have a guy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think there's really any debate. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=209.72s)]
*  The protestor who was killed raised a rifle at him, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=211.68s)]
*  is exactly what happened with you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=214.32s)]
*  How do you think Daniel Perry feels tonight, sitting in jail? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=216.88s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=222.28s)]
*  He's probably sitting there wondering what happened. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=223.4s)]
*  He defended himself. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  He knows what he did was right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=227.96s)]
*  You have a man with an AK-47 and over 120 rounds of ammo [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=230.0s)]
*  on his person dressed just for war, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=234.52s)]
*  as some people might say, with the rifle strapped, the AK-47, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=238.0s)]
*  raising it towards Daniel Perry, who [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  was in flip flops and beach shorts carrying a revolver. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  And nobody wants to talk about that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  Nobody wants to mention that he was armed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=250.32s)]
*  I see a lot of reports just saying [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=252.32s)]
*  he fired indiscriminately into a crowd, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=254.56s)]
*  and he drove into a bunch of rioters. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=257.32s)]
*  They don't want to talk about how his car was [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=259.8s)]
*  swarmed with a bunch of rioters trying to attack him. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=262.92s)]
*  As he was driving for Uber, I mean, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=266.6s)]
*  the least powerful person in our society, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=269.04s)]
*  attacked by one of the worst people in our society who's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=272.2s)]
*  out there rioting, as in your case. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  You were trying to defend a used car lot, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  and a convicted chum molester tried to kill you, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=279.04s)]
*  and they took the convicted chum molester's side. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=281.64s)]
*  Do you see parallels here? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=283.72s)]
*  Absolutely, and you see the double standard in this case. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=287.32s)]
*  People aren't talking about the fact [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=290.44s)]
*  of the second person who attacked Daniel Perry. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=292.0s)]
*  After Sergeant Daniel Perry defended himself [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=296.2s)]
*  against Garrett Foster, he was then shot at three times [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=298.88s)]
*  by a person who was never charged by the Travis County [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=302.6s)]
*  DA, somebody who recklessly fired a slew of shots at Daniel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=305.32s)]
*  Perry's car, and they don't want to talk about that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  They don't want to talk about the recklessness of that, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=316.24s)]
*  and they don't want to charge him. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=318.16s)]
*  It's a double standard, and it's not OK. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=319.24s)]
*  He fired three shots in the middle of a city, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=321.68s)]
*  but that's totally fine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=324.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=326.08s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse, thank you for adding to our knowledge [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=326.76s)]
*  of this story. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWeRGLSrHv0&t=329.2s)]
