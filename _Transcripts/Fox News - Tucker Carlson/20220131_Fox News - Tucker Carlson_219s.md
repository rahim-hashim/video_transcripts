# Jason Whitlock reveals when sports became a 'target of the left'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY)
*  Sports are basically the only way to reach a massive audience on live television. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=12.32s)]
*  It used to be the TV show Dallas or Hill Street Blues or whatever. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=13.32s)]
*  They could all reach pretty substantial audiences because of DVRs and just people watch TV when [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=19.0s)]
*  they want. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=26.96s)]
*  They would fast forward through commercials. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=27.96s)]
*  The only way for advertisers to reach a large amount of viewers and have them captured is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=29.8s)]
*  through live sports. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=35.52s)]
*  Once that became the reality, sports became more of a target of the left in terms of if [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=37.84s)]
*  you want to reach a large segment of Americans and move them politically or whatever message [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=44.44s)]
*  you want to get out, it really has to be done through sports. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=51.06s)]
*  You have to have an alliance with the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=54.8s)]
*  Sports became a target. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=61.36s)]
*  People on the left realized that sports had been a pretty conservative endeavor messaging [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=62.92s)]
*  the values in sports aligned with conservatism. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=72.32s)]
*  Sports tied to religion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=77.92s)]
*  Coaches pray before and after the games, lead the team. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=80.84s)]
*  I think the left figured out that we have to move and change sports if we're going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=84.36s)]
*  to get our message out in a big way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=91.72s)]
*  It started before this, but I said early on in 2016 when Kaepernick started kneeling, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=95.92s)]
*  he's the Trojan horse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=102.36s)]
*  He's going to empower the left to basically take over the sports world, and they've done [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=105.12s)]
*  that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=111.12s)]
*  They've changed the entire discussion around sports by kneeling and created the opportunity [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=112.12s)]
*  for the sports media to come in behind him and support what he's doing and make it this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=120.04s)]
*  really polarizing issue that if you don't support Kaepernick, you're a racist. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=125.4s)]
*  Next thing you know, Roger Goodell and the NFL, they start to fold. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=130.84s)]
*  criticized by the left, by the New York Times, by social media. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=136.76s)]
*  They started incorporating all the Black Lives Matters sloganeering and messaging into their [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=144.88s)]
*  endeavors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=150.72s)]
*  Now when you look at the NBA or the NFL, the commercial breaks, the slogans on the back [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=152.88s)]
*  of helmets and on the field, it's all the BLM, Marxist stuff, all the leftist stuff [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=159.64s)]
*  bake right into the games, and they're using sports to move people politically and to redefine [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  American patriotism. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=177.72s)]
*  Sports used to be this great celebration of the best values of Americana, and now they've [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=180.88s)]
*  turned it into a platform for the very wealthy athletes to wag their finger at America and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=186.24s)]
*  say you know, you've screwed over Black people and people of color, you've screwed over the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=193.72s)]
*  gay community, you've screwed over everybody. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=199.28s)]
*  It's been pretty brilliant the way sports have been manipulated. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOKVA8OnyY&t=216.24s)]
