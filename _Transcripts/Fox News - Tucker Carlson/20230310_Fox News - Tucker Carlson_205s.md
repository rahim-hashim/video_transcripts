# Tucker: This is a huge middle finger to women everywhere
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY)
*  So where are the defenders of women? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=0.0s)]
*  You remember Gloria Steinem famously said, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=1.6s)]
*  if men could get pregnant, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=3.12s)]
*  abortion would be a sacrament. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=4.24s)]
*  Now she's going to House hearings [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=6.48s)]
*  saying men can get pregnant. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=8.32s)]
*  So Kara Dansky probably doesn't vote [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  for the same people we vote for, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  but she's one of the only people we know [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=14.48s)]
*  who has persistently defended [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=16.0s)]
*  the right of women to exist. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=17.92s)]
*  And we are grateful for that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=19.6s)]
*  She's president of the U.S. chapter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=20.64s)]
*  of Women's Declaration International, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=21.92s)]
*  author of the book, The Abolition of Sex. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=23.76s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=25.36s)]
*  Kara Dansky, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  And I'm sorry to make fun of it [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=27.92s)]
*  because it is, of course, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=29.12s)]
*  going to destroy civilization itself. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=31.12s)]
*  But it is kind of amazing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=33.28s)]
*  that all these self-aware, well-educated people [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=34.64s)]
*  are saying this stuff [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  that actually is a huge middle finger [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=37.84s)]
*  in the face of women everywhere. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  It is. It's horrible. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=42.72s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Giving a Women of Courage award [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=45.36s)]
*  to a man on International Women's Day [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  is, of course, appalling and disgusting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=50.08s)]
*  to feminists, including myself, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=52.56s)]
*  who fight for the rights, privacy, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=54.88s)]
*  and safety of women and girls. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=56.32s)]
*  And also, it's not more horrible [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=57.84s)]
*  than anything else that's gone on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  in terms of the erasure of women [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  and girls throughout society. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  We are all expected to accept men [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  who claim to be women, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=69.76s)]
*  either simply by saying that they are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=71.2s)]
*  or by undergoing hormonal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=73.68s)]
*  and or surgical treatment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  to make themselves appear [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=77.04s)]
*  maybe slightly more like women. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=79.2s)]
*  And we're all just supposed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  to accept it and go along. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=82.4s)]
*  I do want to take quick issue [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=83.92s)]
*  with your assertion that feminism is dead. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=85.2s)]
*  I am here to assure viewers [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=87.44s)]
*  feminism is not dead. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=88.96s)]
*  But where I will agree with you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=90.32s)]
*  is that mainstream feminist organizations, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=91.84s)]
*  organizations that claim to be feminist, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=94.16s)]
*  including organizations [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=96.32s)]
*  like Planned Parenthood [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=97.44s)]
*  and the National Organization for Women [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=98.56s)]
*  and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=100.48s)]
*  have completely caved to what is, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=102.4s)]
*  in effect, an industry-fueled [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=104.72s)]
*  men's rights movement. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=106.8s)]
*  So I'll agree with you on that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=108.16s)]
*  But there are those of us [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=109.44s)]
*  on the political left [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  who call ourselves radical feminists [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=112.16s)]
*  and we will not stop fighting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=114.0s)]
*  for women and girls. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=115.2s)]
*  Well, do you think the I mean, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=116.72s)]
*  the average person on any issue [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=118.16s)]
*  has no voice at all in this country. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=120.24s)]
*  And that's, I think, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=121.84s)]
*  becoming more true with the day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=122.64s)]
*  But do you think the average woman [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=124.08s)]
*  sees this as insulting as a man? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=125.44s)]
*  I can as who actually likes women. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=127.92s)]
*  This seems like the most insulting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=130.08s)]
*  possible thing I can imagine. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=131.44s)]
*  Do you think it's perceived that way? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=132.8s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=135.28s)]
*  And, you know, the other day [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=135.84s)]
*  I came across really interesting polling [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=137.52s)]
*  that suggested that people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  who consider themselves to be either [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=141.28s)]
*  very liberal or liberal, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=144.16s)]
*  around 70 to 75 percent [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=146.88s)]
*  know that sex is real, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=149.84s)]
*  know that sex doesn't change. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=151.28s)]
*  So when you're referring to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=152.88s)]
*  liberals going along with this, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=154.8s)]
*  of course you're absolutely right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=156.16s)]
*  that the Democratic Party is pushing this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=157.6s)]
*  and the sort of Democratic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=160.0s)]
*  liberal elite is pushing this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  But ordinary Americans [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=165.84s)]
*  across the political spectrum [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=167.28s)]
*  are not going along. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=168.72s)]
*  And yes, I absolutely think [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=169.68s)]
*  that ordinary average American women [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=171.44s)]
*  see this as insulting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=174.08s)]
*  What they may not realize, though, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=175.36s)]
*  is that it's no more insulting [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=176.96s)]
*  than the so-called trans movement [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  has been to women and girls for years now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=181.28s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  And I appreciate your saying so. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  I know it's probably not a natural move [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  to come on the show, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  but we're grateful that you do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=190.8s)]
*  Kara Dansky, thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=193.36s)]
*  you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPXYs_DHpjY&t=204.08s)]
