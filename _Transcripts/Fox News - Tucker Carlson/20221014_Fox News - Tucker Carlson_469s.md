# Hornacek and Arroyo face off in Tucker's ‘Final Exam’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0)
*  Time now for final exam where we diabolically pit the news experts against one another like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=0.0s)]
*  feral mongies in a cage. Our first contestant tonight, Fox Nation host, Abby Hornacek. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=5.44s)]
*  We're happy to have her. Joining her is our old friend Raymond Arroyo. He's the author of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=11.76s)]
*  new book, The Wise Men Who Found Christmas. And we are really glad that you both are here. I'm not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=15.52s)]
*  going to express any preference at all. Obviously I'm voting for Abby. Yes. But I'm totally, totally, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=21.76s)]
*  kidding. Sorry. That's a good thrill. I've already been talking trash. Let me, let me tell you what [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=28.08s)]
*  the rules are though. I know you're familiar. Hands on buzzers. I asked the questions. All of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=33.04s)]
*  them are multiple choice. The first person to buzz in gets to answer the question. Critically, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=37.12s)]
*  you must wait until I finish asking the question and all the possible answers to the question [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  before buzzing in. If you don't, it goes to the other person. Every correct answer is worth one [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=46.16s)]
*  point. If you get it wrong, we punish you by subtracting a point. Best of five wins. Does [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  that make sense? I think so. Look at that. You have to buzz first before you talk, Abby. Can I hit [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=53.28s)]
*  the buzzer out of his hand? We got it. No, you, physical violence is, I think, and the judges are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  saying that's against the rules. But good luck. I don't think you need it, but we'll find out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=66.56s)]
*  All right. Here's the first question. In an interview this week, Kamala Harris complained [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  about the security measures that go along with being as famous as she is as vice president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=76.16s)]
*  What is the one thing that Kamala Harris says she misses most? Is it A, late night visits to Taco Bell? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=81.68s)]
*  Is it B, sending and receiving emojis? Is it C, driving her Mercedes? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=88.72s)]
*  I think my button's broken. Your button's not broken. It's broken, Raymond. You got to watch [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=97.76s)]
*  that thumb action. I think it's the late night, I think it's the late night trips to Taco Bell. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  That was going to be my answer. Is it late night trips? You know, that sounds like a pretty good [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=108.32s)]
*  guess. I can't comment on. Yeah, do they have marijuana at Taco Bell? Good point. Is it late [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=112.32s)]
*  night visits to Taco Bell? Is it true that you are, you can no longer send emojis? Oh no. I have not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  received directly an emoji in a year and a half. Oh man. Emoji? She has not received an emoji in a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  year and a half. So she's not going to cop to the Taco Bell weed visits. No. Okay. You know she went [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=136.96s)]
*  to Taco Bell. Of course she did. Question two. Okay. Which sitting United States Senator just [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=143.28s)]
*  videoed him or herself chugging a beer after receiving the coveted endorsement from a group [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  of tavern owners in the Midwest? Was it A, Amy Klobuchar? Was it B, Ron Johnson? Was it C, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=154.56s)]
*  famed beer drinker Liz Warren? Oh, this is a guess. It's going to go with B because beer starts with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  B and I feel like that's a good option. Ron Johnson also feels like he could throw a few back. Ron [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=170.48s)]
*  Johnson. I like the way you guess, Abby Horn. In a second we're going to see if you're correct or not [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=175.44s)]
*  to the tape please. Oh my gosh. I want to thank the Wisconsin Tavern Leafy endorsement again. Cheers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=179.68s)]
*  I mean nothing says beer like a suit and tie. Yeah, well I'm kind of upset it wasn't Elizabeth [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=187.68s)]
*  Warren. There you go. Far more interesting. Good guess because he's from Wisconsin where they do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=192.96s)]
*  drink a few beers. Question three. Okay. In a new interview a woman called Karen Elaine Johnson, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=198.8s)]
*  known to some as Whoopi Goldberg, said that when she finally retires from the TV program she's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=207.28s)]
*  disgraced for so many years. She'd like to become a U.S. ambassador to Egypt or which other country? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=213.52s)]
*  This will be two points. Is that country A, Spain? Is it B, Italy? Is it C, Greece? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  Italy. It must be Italy. Well, she was in Sister Act and there are a lot of nuns there, Tucker, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  so maybe she's trying to do some research. She's doing the new Nonsense movie or Sister Act movie. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=234.8s)]
*  This could be a professional visit. She's on a reconnaissance mission. I love how both of you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=240.64s)]
*  have revealed the thought process that led to your guesses and let's see if your reasoning was [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=247.92s)]
*  correct. Well, we'll see. Here we go. One day if I make some money I want to be an ambassador. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm serious. To where? I think I'd like to be an ambassador to either Egypt or Italy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=259.84s)]
*  Thank you, Whoopi. I was on the edge of my seat. She waited to the end to reveal that. She did. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=267.68s)]
*  Okay, so now we're at one-one because that was a two-point question. So we're moving. This is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=273.44s)]
*  accelerating really fast just like life itself. Question four. A small town just directed a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=278.0s)]
*  17-foot statue in honor of something called Cheetal. That's the cheese dust that sticks to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=282.96s)]
*  your fingers. It's under your fingernails when you eat a bag of Cheetos. Where could this town [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  possibly be? Is it in A, Kanada, which is a country to our north? Is it B, the small but proud [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=292.48s)]
*  mountain nation of Switzerland? Or is it C, a place called intercourse Pennsylvania? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  God, I think my button is broken. No, no. I have to go with intercourse Pennsylvania. Your finger's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  fine. It's just slow, Abby. If it had cheese dust on it I think it would have worked. Yes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  Your thumb is so- Like that statue stuck in this position. Go ahead. Okay, so what you're saying is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  when in doubt go with intercourse. Intercourse. Always go with intercourse. Let's see if that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=321.92s)]
*  life rule is going to pay off tonight. It's probably Kanada. The town in Kanada just [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=328.48s)]
*  erected a roadside statue of a giant Cheeto. Wrong. Check it out. Oh. Holy smokes. It's because people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=332.88s)]
*  from Kanada are nice. Back down. It's like they could have erected it a little bit more. Back down again. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=339.92s)]
*  Now, Chuck, what happens? I lose two points or no one gets it? You lose one point. So now [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=344.32s)]
*  Abby's at one, you're at zero. This is the final question. We'll have a tiebreaker if you win this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=348.88s)]
*  This is getting intense. Am I not at two? This is a tiebreaker. Am I not at two? No, you're at one. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=353.76s)]
*  Because I got the Ron Johnson. I think we need to recheck the score. You got one for Ron Johnson. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=357.04s)]
*  That was early on. Don't confuse poor Tucker. You know, I'm not a math guy. So we're just going to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=362.08s)]
*  move into the final question. Now, by order of the National Game Show Commission in Billings, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=367.52s)]
*  Montana, this is a mandatory animal question and it's this. An Alabama dog breeder was shocked, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=372.0s)]
*  was stunned when his French bulldog gave birth to a puppy that was an extremely unusual color. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=377.52s)]
*  What color was that puppy? Was that puppy green? Was it purple? Was it blue? A, B, or C? I'll let [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=382.32s)]
*  you answer because I'm a gentleman. No, no, it's fine. Are you sure? It gains again. All right. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=390.0s)]
*  You can answer. I think the puppy would have to be blue, Tucker. I mean, you don't have green or [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=393.44s)]
*  purple puppies. You just don't. Right. I would hope not. You could have Clifford the big red puppy, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  but let's find out. Let's roll tape. When I first saw the dog, I was like, I thought it was dirty [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=404.8s)]
*  or something. Look at Chloe. She's so adorable. Yeah, Chloe, the little green Frenchie. Are we sure he didn't spray paint the dog? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=412.0s)]
*  And she's a French bulldog. She's a French bulldog. She's a fluffy dog. That can't be real. That's not real. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=418.0s)]
*  They rolled that dog in mockery. It looks like Shrek's puppy. Tucker, that's not a dog. That's Easter egg dye, but whatever. It is green. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=423.68s)]
*  All right. Well, all right. Well, that means Abby Hornacek wins and it does not detract from our [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=429.92s)]
*  deep affection for you, Raymond and Royal, but Abby wins the fabled and coveted John Fetterman neck bulge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=434.4s)]
*  Oh my God. What I always have wanted. Thank you so much. May it brighten your mornings. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=442.32s)]
*  I dare you to drink coffee out of that. Thank you both. It was great to see you. And happy green [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=447.52s)]
*  puppies to you, Tucker. Happy green puppies to you. Thank you. That's it for Final Exam. We'll have [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Mz5Im0fH0&t=452.47999999999996s)]
