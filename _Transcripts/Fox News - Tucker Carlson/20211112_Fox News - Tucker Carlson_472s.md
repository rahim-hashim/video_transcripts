# Tucker: This American city is in crisis
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=0.0s)]
*  Jamal Cole was a political candidate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=5.3s)]
*  He's running for Congress in the first district of Illinois that covers the south side of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=7.04s)]
*  Chicago and some of the southern suburbs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=11.0s)]
*  In late September, Jamal Cole was walking in the Hyde Park neighborhood, just yards [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=13.4s)]
*  from Lake Michigan, when someone shot him through the arm. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=17.2s)]
*  In the end, Cole recovered from his wound. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=21.8s)]
*  He went back to campaigning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=23.6s)]
*  And then on Tuesday of this week, Cole narrowly escaped being shot a second time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=25.28s)]
*  Some unknown assailant opened fire with a rifle right near where Cole was standing, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=30.12s)]
*  just blocks from the University of Chicago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=33.72s)]
*  So Cole dove under a car and escaped being hit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  To be clear, these were not assassination attempts, so far as we know, against a local [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=40.08s)]
*  congressional candidate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  Jamal Cole just happens to live in the city of Chicago, and living there, all of a sudden, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=45.24s)]
*  is that dangerous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=49.36s)]
*  Given how dangerous Chicago has become, it would be interesting to know what exactly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  the sitting mayor is doing to fight crime. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=54.48s)]
*  And in fact, we do know, thanks to a data breach that revealed city emails. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=56.72s)]
*  We can answer that question. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=60.64s)]
*  For example, we know that just before midnight one day last year, Lori Lightfoot, the mayor, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=62.44s)]
*  typed a furious note to her senior staff. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=66.56s)]
*  She was upset about crime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=68.64s)]
*  She received a shocking report of offenses in progress, evidence of clear and present [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=69.8s)]
*  danger to the people of Chicago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  According to an informant, a group of suspects had been observed playing basketball outside. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Some of them reportedly had been seen dunking, even shooting three-pointers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=83.76s)]
*  Quote, I got a text from someone who lives on the north side who reported that dudes [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  were out at a park playing basketball, Lightfoot wrote. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  That one sent me around the bend. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=94.4s)]
*  Thankfully, Lori Lightfoot had a solution. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=97.28s)]
*  Quote, here is where I want to be starting tomorrow. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  You may walk outside in the immediate proximity of your house, fresh air is important, but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  you may not act like the city is not in crisis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=107.64s)]
*  End quote. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=111.56s)]
*  According to Lori Lightfoot, the city of Chicago is in crisis, a basketball crisis. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=113.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's another crisis in progress. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=119.68s)]
*  People continue to die in huge numbers in Chicago. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  Over the past 12 months, almost 800 Chicagoans have been murdered. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=125.0s)]
*  According to an analysis by CWB Chicago, at least 50 of these killings this year were [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=129.12s)]
*  committed by criminals who had been released early on bail. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=133.5s)]
*  They didn't need to happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=136.04s)]
*  Just a few days ago, yet another man was murdered just steps from the University of Chicago. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=137.88s)]
*  Chicago police say it was just before two Tuesday afternoon. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=143.4s)]
*  The victim, a 24-year-old man and recent University of Chicago graduate, was killed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=146.88s)]
*  Police say the man was walking on the sidewalk at Ellis and 54th Place when the armed offender [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=151.96s)]
*  got out of a dark-colored vehicle, demanded the victim's belongings, then shot him in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=156.68s)]
*  chest. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=161.16s)]
*  There were actually two shootings in Hyde Park Tuesday, the first around noon near 53rd [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=162.16s)]
*  and Harper. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=166.84s)]
*  No injuries reported, but congressional candidate and community activist Jamal Cole writing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=167.84s)]
*  on his Facebook page that he was nearly struck. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=172.56s)]
*  Quote, today I thought I was going to die because I saw blood coming from my neck thinking [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=175.36s)]
*  I was shot again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=180.4s)]
*  Fortunately, it was a scrape from diving under a car. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Shot again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=187.48s)]
*  Just a day in the life of a congressional candidate in the city of Chicago. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=188.6s)]
*  By the way, the name of the murdered University of Chicago graduate was Dennis Zheng. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=191.6s)]
*  He was 24 years old. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=195.52s)]
*  He was killed in an armed robbery. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=197.08s)]
*  Apparently he handed over what he had, but they murdered him anyway in the middle of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=198.64s)]
*  the day. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  He is the third University of Chicago student to be murdered this year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  In July, a 20-year-old called Max Lewis was hit in the back of the neck by a stray bullet [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=208.27999999999997s)]
*  as he was sitting on a subway train. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=212.44s)]
*  In January, a 30-year-old graduate student was killed in a shooting spree that killed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  several other people, including a 15-year-old girl. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  The University of Chicago is now so dangerous that the school is offering free lift rides [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=222.11999999999998s)]
*  to students seven days a week so they don't have to mix with the local population. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=226.56s)]
*  That may keep them from getting killed, but it is hardly a solution to the problem. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=230.8s)]
*  So what is the solution to the problem? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=234.7s)]
*  800 people murdered in a year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=236.44s)]
*  Well no one in authority in Chicago appears to be thinking much about that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=239.0s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot is on the record saying she believes the core problem is white racism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=241.88s)]
*  It's bigoted cops. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=245.68s)]
*  And for a while, some of the more affluent residents of Chicago were willing to believe [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=247.52s)]
*  that was true. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=250.72s)]
*  Last year in September, for example, University of Chicago students encouraged by faculty [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=253.0s)]
*  members surrounded the home of the school's provost. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=256.6s)]
*  They occupied the street in front of her house. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=259.88s)]
*  They shut down traffic for an entire week. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=261.44s)]
*  They demanded disarming and disbanding the school's police department. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=263.6s)]
*  Now in one of those twists of irony, you really have to pause to savor, those students are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=268.8s)]
*  demanding chaperone rides home because their classmates are getting murdered because the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=272.8s)]
*  policies they advocated for result in death. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=276.78s)]
*  So this might be a perfect moment for those kids and the adult nihilists who pushed them [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=280.8s)]
*  to do what they did to admit they were completely wrong and learn something. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=285.26s)]
*  Cops are not the problem. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=290.08s)]
*  Have they conceded that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=292.56s)]
*  Not that we're aware of. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=293.56s)]
*  Nor the city officials who banned cops from conducting foot chases admitted that what [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=294.56s)]
*  they did resulted in the deaths of citizens. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=298.76s)]
*  We've been watching carefully and as far as we can tell, only one person in authority [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=303.52s)]
*  the University of Chicago understood what was happening at the time and said so. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=307.24s)]
*  He's a professor called Harold Eulig. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=311.08s)]
*  Eulig publicly objected to defunding the police, not because he's some kind of radical, but [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=313.2s)]
*  because then as now, that is a completely demented idea that results in people getting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=317.56s)]
*  killed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  So Eulig said that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  And for the crime of saying it, he was fired from his job at the Chicago Fed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=325.08s)]
*  The University of Chicago began an investigation into him for his thought crime. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=329.3s)]
*  Hundreds of economists signed a petition to have Harold Eulig removed as the editor [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=333.0s)]
*  of a major economics journal. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=337.64s)]
*  What do those views have to do with economics? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=339.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=340.68s)]
*  But they joined the mob anyway. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=341.76s)]
*  One of the jackals in that mob, by the way, was none other than Janet Yellen. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=342.76s)]
*  You may recognize the name because she's now our Treasury Secretary. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=346.36s)]
*  Yellen wrote this Soviet little statement at the time, quote, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=349.96s)]
*  Because he opposed getting rid of the police. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=363.48s)]
*  To this day, notably, Janet Yellen has never retracted that statement or apologized for [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=366.44s)]
*  joining the mob to hurt an innocent man for telling the truth. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=371.04s)]
*  That's fine with her. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=374.72s)]
*  It's fine with her now. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=375.72s)]
*  The other activists who targeted Harold Eulig have admitted they were wrong. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=377.28s)]
*  No, they haven't. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=380.56s)]
*  So after the recent shootings near campus, Harold Eulig made this request of the university [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=382.4s)]
*  community, quote, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=386.36s)]
*  But of course, that's not what's happening. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=393.96s)]
*  No one's apologized. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=395.68s)]
*  No one's learned anything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=397.24s)]
*  The politicians ruining the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago demand above all that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=399.08s)]
*  you worship them like gods as people die around them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=403.56s)]
*  As it happens, by the way, all of this killing is happening very close to where former President [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=408.04s)]
*  Barack Obama is building a massive, unprecedentedly large shrine to himself known euphemistically [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=411.68s)]
*  as a presidential library. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=418.2s)]
*  Total cost of this project? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=419.76s)]
*  At least $830 million, nearly a billion dollars, to celebrate Barack Obama, just in case you're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdzylE1NSU&t=421.28s)]
