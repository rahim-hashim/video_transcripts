# Tucker: This is one of the worst stories of our time
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs)
*  Well, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. If you tuned in to see the hearing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Senate Armed Services Committee today, and if you didn't, you missed out, but if [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=8.36s)]
*  you did, you may have been a little surprised to see Mark Milley sitting there. You remember [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=12.56s)]
*  Milley? He's the fleshy, hood-eyed man who's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=17.12s)]
*  He is also a national disgrace. He's a living insult to the military he oversees. That's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=23.2s)]
*  not an insult. It's objectively true. And yet somehow, despite the overwhelming evidence [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=27.84s)]
*  that Mark Milley is dishonest, incompetent, partisan, dishonorable, Mark Milley still [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=34.8s)]
*  has a highly prominent job. That's the amazing thing. And not only is Mark Milley still employed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=39.7s)]
*  at the very highest level, he is still lying and doing so with his characteristic relish [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=45.18s)]
*  and enthusiasm. Today, for example, with an entirely straight face, Mark Milley delivered [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=50.08s)]
*  an impassioned lecture about the importance of civilian control of the military. Quote, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=55.24s)]
*  This country doesn't want generals figuring out what orders we're going to accept or do [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  or not. That's not our job. Oh, really? Is that so, Mark Milley? Isn't this the same [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=65.64s)]
*  Mark Milley who once illegally seized personal control of our country's nuclear arsenal? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=73.6s)]
*  And then when that wasn't sufficient, promised to tip off the government of China about future [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=79.58s)]
*  American military operations and did all of this because he didn't like his boss, who [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  unlike him was, yes, a civilian elected by voters. Yep, that's the very same Mark Milley, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=88.88s)]
*  the one lecturing you today about civilian control of the military. It was all pretty [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=94.64s)]
*  amusing in a dark way, but it did make you wonder what is this about? Why is Mark Milley [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=98.84s)]
*  saying something so obviously preposterous? It's got to be helping him in some way. And [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=104.96s)]
*  indeed it was helping him. What you watched in the Senate hearing today was pure blame [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=110.96s)]
*  shifting. Joe Biden's foreign policy is a legitimate disaster. Nobody disputes that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=116.16s)]
*  But Mark Milley wants you to know that none of it is his fault. Secretary of Defense [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=121.6s)]
*  Lloyd Austin wants you to know that too. So does the head of central command, General [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  McKenzie. All three of them want to make it crystal clear that the senile guy in the White [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=129.6s)]
*  House did this. It's his fault, not theirs. It was Joe Biden, they told us today, who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=134.2s)]
*  forced American troops to leave Afghanistan before we evacuated all American citizens. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=139.78s)]
*  And because the Pentagon reflexively, in every case, follows every order to the letter from [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=144.98s)]
*  the sitting president, they had no choice but to obey these crazy decisions. Watch them [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=149.54s)]
*  explain. General Milley, it's your testimony that you recommended 2,500 troops approximately [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=155.18s)]
*  stay in Afghanistan? Yes, my assessment was back in the fall of 20 and it remained consistent [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=163.22s)]
*  throughout that we should keep a steady state of 2,500 and it could bounce up to 3,500 maybe [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=169.74s)]
*  something like that. General McKenzie, do you share that assessment? Senator, I do share [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=174.54s)]
*  that assessment. President Biden last month in an interview with George Stephanopoulos [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=179.7s)]
*  said that no military leader advised him to leave a small troop presence in Afghanistan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=184.34s)]
*  Did these officer and General Miller's recommendations get to the president personally? Their input [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=191.18s)]
*  was received by the president and considered by the president for sure. In terms of what [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=196.84s)]
*  they specifically recommended, Senator, as they just said, they're not going to provide [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=203.84s)]
*  what they recommended in confidence. Are you following this? Wheel's officially coming [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=210.46s)]
*  off but whoa, what sleazeballs these guys are. We told Joe Biden to keep 2,500 troops [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  in the country. We demanded it. On the other hand, because we are bound by the ancient [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=222.26s)]
*  and sacred rules of confidentiality, we can't really tell you what we told the president [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=226.64s)]
*  because that would be wrong. These people so thoroughly deserve each other. It is wonderful [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=231.1s)]
*  to see them rat one another out, which is exactly what they proceeded to do for the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=238.98s)]
*  entirety of today's hearings. Watch General McKenzie explain that despite the fact that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=242.68s)]
*  he personally oversaw the disaster in Afghanistan, actually he had nothing to do with it. It [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=247.56s)]
*  was all demented grandpa pulling the strings from the White House. I won't share my personal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=252.96s)]
*  recommendation to the president, but I will give you my honest opinion and my honest opinion [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=258.32s)]
*  and view shaped my recommendation. I recommended that we maintain 2,500 troops in Afghanistan [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=262.96s)]
*  and I also recommended earlier in the fall of 2020 that we maintain 4,500 at that time. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=269.12s)]
*  Those are my personal views. I also have a view that the withdrawal of those forces [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=275.24s)]
*  would lead inevitably to the collapse of the Afghan military forces and eventually the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=279.72s)]
*  Afghan government. What a dirtball that guy is. Did you just hear that? I can't share [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=284.2s)]
*  my recommendation quote, but here was my recommendation. Take those medals off. You don't deserve them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=289.88s)]
*  Until today, the generals and their many allies in government have been undermining Biden [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=299.08s)]
*  indirectly and far be it for us to defend Joe Biden, who deserves no defense, but it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=303.16s)]
*  is a defense of the American system, which works well when civilians control the military. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  Up until today, they have been leaking Biden's phone calls. For example, the president of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  Afghanistan that's illegal, but they did it anyway. They'd be giving nasty background [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=317.88000000000005s)]
*  quotes to their stenographers at NBC News about what a dope Biden is. All true, but [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=321.72s)]
*  still they're not allowed to do that. But today was different. Today's performance took [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=325.8s)]
*  place in public. It was on the record and it was under oath. And in that performance, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=330.0s)]
*  they directly contradicted the commander in chief. As a reminder, here's what Joe Biden [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=334.96s)]
*  was saying just a few weeks ago on ABC. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=340.28s)]
*  in a timeframe, all troops. They didn't argue against that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=359.84s)]
*  So no one told your military advisers and not tell you, no, we should just keep 2,500 [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=364.56s)]
*  troops. It's been a stable situation for the last several years. We can do that. We can [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=368.76s)]
*  continue to do that. No, no one said that to me. They're not coming to call. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=372.64s)]
*  It's not a defense of any of them. They're all so awful and so undeserving of leading [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=378.76s)]
*  this great country. They should not be in charge of this country. It's too good a country [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=383.0s)]
*  for people like this. So here you have the generals claiming they told Biden the Afghan [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=387.04s)]
*  withdrawal would be a total disaster. Biden, just in the tape you saw, says they did not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  tell him that. The question is who's lying? Someone's lying. Joe Biden doesn't know who's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=395.56s)]
*  lying. He can't remember anything. He doesn't know what he had for lunch. Here's what we [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  know for sure, though. And this is the point of today's hearings. And it's the point that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  matters going forward. No one in the Pentagon's leadership will ever be held accountable for [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=406.16s)]
*  latest in a very long string of colossal screw ups that have dramatically reduced American [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=413.32s)]
*  power and prestige around the world and gotten a ton of people killed. No one. This is unbelievable. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=417.8s)]
*  Let's say you worked at a nuclear power plant and one day you had too many beers on your [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=425.8s)]
*  lunch break and you fell asleep and the reactor melted down and thousands died. And then you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=429.36s)]
*  got a massive raise. That's pretty much what's happening here. The House of Representatives [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=434.64s)]
*  just passed a $776 billion defense budget. How big is that? Well, it's fully $24 billion [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=439.72s)]
*  more than even the White House requested. In other words, Congress just threw a little [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=446.48s)]
*  extra for a job well done. A bonus for the generals who left $80 billion worth of American [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=451.48s)]
*  military equipment for the Taliban to use. Good work, guys. So it's official now. No [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=456.92s)]
*  one will ever be punished for any of it. Not for abandoning Bagram Air Base. That was idiotic. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  Everyone knew it. They did it anyway. Not for leaving American citizens behind as they [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=469.7s)]
*  fled. Not for leaving our troops exposed to the attack that killed 13 young American servicemen. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=473.38s)]
*  Not for the drone strike that blew up children, the one they lied about for weeks. The people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=479.94s)]
*  who did these things are in great shape tonight. They will retire exactly when they feel like [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=484.38s)]
*  retiring, at which point they will get full benefits and jobs at Lockheed. That's how [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=488.9s)]
*  our system now works. It's very, very frustrating. Not because recrimination is good, but because [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=493.7s)]
*  in order to function, a system has to be accountable. And as of tonight, there's only one man in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=501.78s)]
*  the entire U.S. government who is being punished for the failure, the catastrophic failure [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  in Afghanistan. Just one man. His name is Stu Scheller. He is a lieutenant colonel in [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  the United States Marine Corps. He is an honorable and honest man. He is also blameless. Scheller [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=517.98s)]
*  had no role in any of these decisions. What was his crime? His crime was criticizing those [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=522.98s)]
*  decisions. In August, he posted this video on the internet. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=528.38s)]
*  If an 05 battalion commander has the simplest live fire incident, EO complaint, boom, fire. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=532.74s)]
*  But we have a secretary of defense that testified to Congress in May that the Afghan National [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=538.38s)]
*  Security Force could withstand the Taliban advance. We have chairmen of joint chief who [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=543.1s)]
*  the command is a member of that. We're supposed to advise on military policy. We have a Marine [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  combatant commander. All of these people are supposed to advise. And I'm not saying we've [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=552.74s)]
*  got to be in Afghanistan forever, but I am saying, did any of you throw your rank on [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=557.5s)]
*  the table and say, hey, it's a bad idea to evacuate Bagram Airfield, the strategic air [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=562.78s)]
*  barriers before we evacuate everyone? So that's an honorable man you just saw on the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=566.94s)]
*  screen. That's a man who's in it for the right reasons, not to get promoted or work at Lockheed, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=572.3s)]
*  but because he cares about the country and wants to defend it. There's a man who believed [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  in his superiors, who is not cynical, who is genuinely confused by his superiors' unwillingness [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=580.06s)]
*  to admit their own error. His confusion comes from decency. And almost immediately, his [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  superiors reacted to that video. They didn't apologize for the disaster. They didn't explain [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=594.8599999999999s)]
*  why they did what they did. They punished Sheller. They relieved him of his command [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=598.66s)]
*  and they told him to shut up and stop talking. But he didn't stop talking. Here's how he [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTGSoX3imPs&t=604.18s)]
