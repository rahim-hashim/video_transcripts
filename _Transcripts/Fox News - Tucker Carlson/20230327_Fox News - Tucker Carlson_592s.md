# Tucker: This would give the government terrifying power
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw)
*  Every day, more than two billion people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=0.0s)]
*  use a social media app called TikTok. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=2.7s)]
*  Many of them are young people under the age of 24. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=4.78s)]
*  If you had kids, you probably know already [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=7.82s)]
*  how TikTok works. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=9.84s)]
*  TikTok lets users upload short videos. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=11.34s)]
*  Usually they're under 30 seconds. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=13.56s)]
*  What's interesting is that the content of these videos [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=15.9s)]
*  varies a lot depending upon what country you're in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=18.26s)]
*  If you're in China, where TikTok is headquartered, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=21.3s)]
*  you tend to get more educational content. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=23.98s)]
*  But if you live in this country, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=26.42s)]
*  you get an awful lot of filth and propaganda [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=27.68s)]
*  tailored for kids. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=30.44s)]
*  We're not guessing about this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=31.92s)]
*  We ran an experiment to prove it last summer. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=33.32s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=36.36s)]
*  The TikTok that Chinese residents, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=37.64s)]
*  children in China get to see, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=40.36s)]
*  is very different from the one your kids are looking at here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=42.28s)]
*  Now in China, where TikTok is known under a different name, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=47.44s)]
*  videos like these are very common. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=52.96s)]
*  ["Legends Ever Die"] [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=54.099999999999994s)]
*  You know what American kids, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=68.5s)]
*  your kids are watching on TikTok? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=69.74s)]
*  Stuff like this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=71.34s)]
*  ["Player IG"] [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=73.42s)]
*  ["Sweetie"] [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=83.8s)]
*  ["Sweetie"] [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=86.38s)]
*  ["Sweetie"] [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=93.86s)]
*  Well, that's kind of weird. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  Can you see what's going on here? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=101.1s)]
*  Well, China does. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=102.38s)]
*  They run TikTok. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=103.22s)]
*  And China knows, if you want a productive society [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=104.22s)]
*  that extends beyond, say, next week, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=107.5s)]
*  you teach your kids about hard work and creativity [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=110.3s)]
*  and personal responsibility, respect for authority. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=113.42s)]
*  But if you want to destroy a society, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=116.48s)]
*  you funnel a ton of garbage to kids [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=118.88s)]
*  about gender ideology and twerking. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=120.92s)]
*  As the account Libs of TikTok has documented extensively, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=123.8s)]
*  that's exactly what TikTok is doing here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=126.76s)]
*  There's a whole genre of videos of teachers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=129.04s)]
*  boasting about indoctrinating kids. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=131.28s)]
*  I have had multiple students come out to me, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=135.08s)]
*  not just with their sexuality, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=137.44s)]
*  but also with their gender identity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I think it's so important [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  to be out and loud and proud. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=144.58s)]
*  I teach my elementary school students about gender identity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  Some people are girls, some are boys, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=149.34s)]
*  some are both, some are neither. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  I might tell this kid, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=152.34s)]
*  we do have a flag in the class [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=153.9s)]
*  that you can pledge your allegiance to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  And he like looks around and he goes, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=158.68s)]
*  oh, that one? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=160.74s)]
*  So it goes without saying that net-net, as they say, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=165.46s)]
*  TikTok is not a positive influence [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  on American society. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=171.3s)]
*  And right now in response to criticism of TikTok, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=172.96s)]
*  China's government and the company itself [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=175.44s)]
*  are doing the same thing they did [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  when they responded to allegations of a lab leak in Wuhan. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  They're saying anyone who raises questions is a racist. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  And they're doing that everywhere across the media. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=187.28s)]
*  And they can because a lot of the news that you consume [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  is paid for by TikTok. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=193.44s)]
*  Politico, a completely, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=196.28s)]
*  completely ideologically corrupt organization [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=198.44s)]
*  in Northern Virginia, has a so-called playbook [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=200.74s)]
*  that is sponsored by TikTok every other week. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=203.26s)]
*  CNN, meanwhile, just put its tech reporter on the air [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=206.82s)]
*  to inform you that criticizing TikTok [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=209.42s)]
*  opens up Chinese Americans to quote, hate and violence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=211.9s)]
*  If you criticize TikTok, you're killing Asian people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=216.46s)]
*  So confronted with all this, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=220.06s)]
*  you might support efforts in the Congress right now [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=221.56s)]
*  to ban TikTok altogether. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=223.6s)]
*  And a lot of people do, not just on the right, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=225.7s)]
*  but also on the left, which is kind of interesting. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=229.12s)]
*  This is one of those weird moments where there's, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=231.56s)]
*  or appears to be some kind of bipartisan consensus. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=233.58s)]
*  And that alone might wanna make you pause for a second. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=236.26s)]
*  If everyone in power is saying the same thing, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  is it really a good idea? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  Let's take a closer look. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  And again, this is not a defensive TikTok, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=244.58s)]
*  merely an acknowledgement of what's actually happening [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=246.58s)]
*  in Washington right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=249.22s)]
*  So one of the bills that would ban TikTok is being pushed, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=250.66s)]
*  as we said, by senators in both parties. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  It's called the Restrict Act. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=255.1s)]
*  Mark Warner of Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  Democrat and Republican, introduced this legislation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=260.82s)]
*  Now the bill is extensively [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=264.08s)]
*  up protecting American national security [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=265.44s)]
*  and ending quote, foreign adversaries [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=267.96s)]
*  from interfering in our election through apps like TikTok. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=270.85999999999996s)]
*  Because of course, election interference [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=274.64s)]
*  by Twitter and Facebook is no problem at all. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=276.06s)]
*  But election interference from TikTok [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=278.85999999999996s)]
*  is totally unacceptable, okay. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=280.4s)]
*  But in reality, and you should know this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  if you're opposed to TikTok as we are, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=285.08s)]
*  this bill isn't really about banning TikTok. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=287.52s)]
*  It's never about what they say it is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=289.96s)]
*  Instead, this bill would give enormous [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=292.3s)]
*  and terrifying new powers to the federal government [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=294.7s)]
*  to punish American citizens [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=298.2s)]
*  and regulate how they communicate with one another. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=300.12s)]
*  For example, the bill would regulate quote, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=303.48s)]
*  certain transactions between persons in the United States [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=306.16s)]
*  and foreign adversaries. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=309.16s)]
*  Now what's a foreign adversary and who gets to decide? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=311.28s)]
*  Well, the secretary of commerce and the DNI, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  not the Congress, get to decide what foreign adversaries are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=320.02s)]
*  Well that ought to trip a switch in your brain. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=323.86s)]
*  And then the transactions with foreign adversaries [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  would include quote, any acquisition, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=329.66s)]
*  importation, transfer, installation, dealing in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=332.26s)]
*  or use of any information [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  and communications technology product or service, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=337.1s)]
*  including ongoing activities such as mandated services, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  data transmission, software updates, repairs [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=342.46s)]
*  or the provision of data hosting services. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's pretty broad. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=347.28s)]
*  Under this bill, if you engage in any of that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=348.88s)]
*  with a so-called foreign adversary as determined by [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=351.76s)]
*  in this case, the Biden administration, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  that would allow the secretary of commerce, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Gina Raimondo and the director of national intelligence, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=357.68s)]
*  Averyl Haynes to decide whether you're acting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=359.96s)]
*  in the quote, interest of a foreign adversary. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  Again, that's another term that the executive branch [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  of secretary of commerce gets to define [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=369.32s)]
*  without the interference of Congress. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=371.14s)]
*  So if the Biden administration decides that you're doing this, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=373.3s)]
*  then the secretary of commerce can then enforce quote, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=376.7s)]
*  any mitigation measure to address any risk arising [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=380.02s)]
*  from any covered transaction with any person [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=383.74s)]
*  or with respect to any property subject [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=386.82s)]
*  to the jurisdiction of the United States. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=389.1s)]
*  Oh, these covered transactions can involve quote, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=390.94s)]
*  current past or potential future transactions. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=394.82s)]
*  And the mitigation member measures include, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=398.66s)]
*  but are not limited to throwing American citizens [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=400.58s)]
*  in prison for 20 years. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  Think about that for a minute. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=406.68s)]
*  So you would be allowing the executive branch, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=408.44s)]
*  the Biden administration to regulate speech on the internet. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=410.9s)]
*  And if you are somehow involved with a quote, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=414.76s)]
*  foreign adversary, or let's say you oppose the war [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  against Russia, you go to prison for 20 years. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  So this isn't about banning TikTok. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  This is about introducing flat out totalitarianism [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=428.3s)]
*  into our system. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=430.92s)]
*  Now, just because TikTok is so unappealing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=432.5s)]
*  just because it's a creepy low IQ Chinese plot [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=434.62s)]
*  designed to make our kids trans, and it is, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=437.5s)]
*  that does not mean that the people trying to ban TikTok [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=441.02000000000004s)]
*  have your interests in mind. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=443.94s)]
*  Oh, it definitely doesn't or America's. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  Keep in mind, these are exactly the same people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=448.02s)]
*  who drained our strategic petroleum reserve [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=450.1s)]
*  and in fact promote China at every turn. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=452.62s)]
*  Now they're telling you they're against China, they're not. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=454.66s)]
*  This is not an effort to push back against China. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=457.82s)]
*  It's part of a strategy to make America much more like China [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=460.78s)]
*  with the government in charge of what you read and see [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=465.0s)]
*  and with terrifying punitive powers at their fingertips. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=467.58s)]
*  Now we've seen this before [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=471.46s)]
*  from the national security state again and again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=472.7s)]
*  Confronted with the foreign adversary, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  for example, after 9-11, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=476.62s)]
*  the federal government uses the opportunity [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=478.06s)]
*  to expand their police powers over the American population. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=480.06s)]
*  And they do it under false pretexts and they do it quickly [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=483.84s)]
*  by whipping people into a panic. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=487.2s)]
*  Usually that's rooted in some truth. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=488.82s)]
*  TikTok is bad, sure. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=490.52s)]
*  Al-Qaeda was terrible, of course. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=493.12s)]
*  But these measures are not aimed [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=495.88s)]
*  at stopping the foreign threat, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=498.4s)]
*  they're aimed at controlling the American population [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=499.68s)]
*  and they rush it through. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=501.56s)]
*  And they do it so quickly that no one ever explains [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=503.84s)]
*  how exactly does this preserve American national security. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=507.28s)]
*  Now, according to Sandy Cortez, we really quote her, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=509.76s)]
*  Congress has not even briefed on any of this, watch. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=513.8s)]
*  Usually when the United States is proposing [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=517.76s)]
*  a very major move that has something to do [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=520.2800000000001s)]
*  with significant risk to national security, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  one of the first things that happens [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  is that Congress receives a classified briefing. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=527.24s)]
*  And I can tell you that Congress has not received [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  a classified briefing around the allegations [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  of national security risks regarding TikTok. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=534.44s)]
*  So why would we be proposing a ban [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=537.12s)]
*  regarding such a significant issue [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  without being included on this at all? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=541.44s)]
*  It just doesn't feel right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=543.96s)]
*  Okay, so again, in case you think we've gone crazy [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=547.08s)]
*  and we're defending Sandy Cortez, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=549.36s)]
*  we should point out that she is a tool [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=551.1600000000001s)]
*  of the national security state, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=553.5200000000001s)]
*  she's out promoting a war against Russia, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  and anyone who asks questions is an ally of Putin, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=556.5200000000001s)]
*  and she's probably acting for motives [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=559.6s)]
*  that we find well-abhorrent. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=562.0s)]
*  But the question that she raises is real, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=565.0s)]
*  and we wanna be honest enough to say that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=567.96s)]
*  This may be one of those times [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=570.5200000000001s)]
*  when they're commenting in Washington [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=572.12s)]
*  where the solution has nothing to do with the problem, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=573.28s)]
*  and in fact, degrades our free country [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=576.56s)]
*  and makes it something unrecognizable. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZJ-hHxSqkw&t=579.3199999999999s)]
