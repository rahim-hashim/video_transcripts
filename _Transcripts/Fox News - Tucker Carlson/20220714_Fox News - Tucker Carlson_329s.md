# Alleged rapist of 10-year-old in Ohio is illegal immigrant
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8)
*  To Joe Biden, other human beings only exist to the extent they can be used for partisan ends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=0.0s)]
*  So it shouldn't surprise you that on Friday he used the story of a 10-year-old rape victim to push for more abortion. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=4.88s)]
*  According to Joe Biden, the laws in Ohio forced a 10-year-old rape victim to flee to Indiana to get that abortion. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=11.52s)]
*  The White House never vetted the facts of that story, as the President of the United States sang things that no one checked, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=18.72s)]
*  but the facts didn't make any sense. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  On Monday, for example, the Attorney General of Ohio said there would not be a reason for this child to flee to Ohio in the first place. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=26.96s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=33.04s)]
*  Ohio's heartbeat law has a medical emergency exception, broader than just the life of the mother. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=34.64s)]
*  This young girl, if she exists and if this horrible thing actually happened to her, breaks my heart to think about it, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=44.24s)]
*  she did not have to leave Ohio to find treatment. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  So the obvious headline here was not about abortion, it was about the crime committed against a child. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=57.76s)]
*  Who raped a 10-year-old? That was our first question. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  Nobody seemed interested at all in learning who this person was, and maybe there was a reason for that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=65.92s)]
*  In fact, there was another moral to the story. Apparently, the rapist was an illegal alien. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=71.84s)]
*  The Columbus Dispatch is reporting tonight that a 27-year-old called Gershon Fuentes has confessed to raping the 10-year-old child on multiple occasions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=77.28s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow with the Hoover Institution, and we're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=86.0s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. So what do you take from this story? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=89.84s)]
*  Well, it's a tragic story, Tucker, but it gets more mysterious every day because apparently this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=96.4s)]
*  terrible, horrendous act was reported on the 22nd or near abouts in June, and here we are on July 13th, 14th, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=103.76s)]
*  and we're only now learning about who did this. In other words, this perpetrator apparently was not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=111.68s)]
*  charged or arraigned, and yet people knew that he had coerced a young, maybe at the time, a nine-year-old [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=118.0s)]
*  to be pregnant. And so the question is, why now, at this belated date, are we learning who he was? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=123.84s)]
*  And maybe, I mean, a naive might say, well, it was because people had questioned the veracity of the story, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=130.08s)]
*  and people, for whatever nebulous reasons, didn't want to reveal his identity until revealing his [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=136.16s)]
*  identity was the only mechanism for substantiating the story in the first place. But in that time, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=142.48s)]
*  it seems like a person who had a proclivity to have, you know, coercive sex with minors was still [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=148.4s)]
*  out there, and we don't know what he was doing. He should have been, as soon as they reported [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=154.8s)]
*  the act, he should have been arraigned immediately. And then the next thing was, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=159.2s)]
*  the attorney general mentioned they heartbeat law at six weeks, but the abortionists who became [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=163.28s)]
*  the spokesman for the story said, well, the abortion was committed, was done six weeks and three days. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, can't you, why was it so close to that day? It was almost as if, if you knew about this act, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=178.24s)]
*  you had a method inside Ohio, if you believe that that was a proper course, it would have been legal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=185.04s)]
*  within six weeks rather than to go over to Indiana and then be told, well, it was six weeks [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=191.84s)]
*  and three days. It doesn't, the whole, all of these details, they reek of a political weaponization [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=197.84s)]
*  of the case, which is tragic because we have a nine-year-old, I guess, at the time of the act, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=204.24s)]
*  she was nine, and she's being used for political purposes, which is terrible. And then we have this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=209.04s)]
*  perpetrator, and now we learn that he is here illegally from Guatemala, and he's residing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=214.4s)]
*  illegally, and no one has, he was, the actor was reported, and for two, almost three weeks, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=220.4s)]
*  he hasn't been charged. So we don't, we're gonna have to wait for more details, but it's mysterious, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=226.56s)]
*  it's terrible what's going on. So it sounds like in this case, as in pretty much every case we've [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=233.52s)]
*  reported on for the past five years, the first version was a lie. Everything is partisan propaganda, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=239.36s)]
*  and kind of believe nothing at first. Maybe that's the takeaway. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  It reminds me a lot of the whipping story that Joe Biden also promulgated about border patrols [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=251.28s)]
*  whipping people, and we found out only later that it wasn't true at all, and then there were desperate [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=256.48s)]
*  efforts to bring in more evidence to sort of incriminate them to save the reputation of the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=262.48s)]
*  president. So I think what's happened is that this fellow was finally charged when they needed some [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=266.64s)]
*  substantiation of this story, but they didn't seem, they seemed reluctant to charge him quicker and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=271.92s)]
*  almost immediately because they felt the story would be believable and be useful on its own [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=277.92s)]
*  merits, and then when people questioned it and wanted details, only then did they start releasing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=282.96s)]
*  the details, which caused only more mystery. But the whole thing is, I think it's terrible, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=288.16s)]
*  because it shows you that people are using a 10-year-old and protecting in some cases an [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=295.2s)]
*  illegal alien, if that happened to be true, that they deliberately delayed arraigning him until they [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=301.6s)]
*  needed evidence to substantiate this useful story. It's terrible. They don't care about people, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=306.24s)]
*  they care about power. Victor Davis Hanson, appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIPvQb_Gma8&t=312.32s)]
