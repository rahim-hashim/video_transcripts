# Glenn Greenwald reveals Brazil’s similarities to US
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA)
*  So we're in Brazil last week, part of the time in Rio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=0.0s)]
*  So naturally, we hooked up with Glenn Greenwald, who [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=2.52s)]
*  lives there, went over to his house, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=4.84s)]
*  had a bunch of interesting conversations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  One of them's on tape. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=8.22s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=9.6s)]
*  So in American media, you often hear Bolsonaro [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=13.16s)]
*  dismissed as a dictator. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=15.94s)]
*  Now, whatever you think of his policies, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=17.72s)]
*  if he were a dictator, he would have the two things [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=20.04s)]
*  that all dictators have, A, a cult of personality, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=22.16s)]
*  and B, a compliant media to reinforce [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  that cult of personality. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  And as it turns out, Bolsonaro doesn't have either one [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=28.9s)]
*  of those things. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=31.02s)]
*  In fact, Brazil does not have a significant media that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=31.74s)]
*  challenges the establishment narrative. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=34.98s)]
*  And we asked Bolsonaro why that is, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=37.78s)]
*  and what would happen if something like, I don't know, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=40.14s)]
*  Fox News existed in Brazil. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=42.3s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=43.98s)]
*  Why is there no Fox News in Brazil? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=45.66s)]
*  CNN is here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=47.22s)]
*  You got over 50 million votes in the last election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=48.3s)]
*  CNN's a political player here, so it was Globo. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=50.94s)]
*  But there's no TV channel for your voters? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=53.42s)]
*  Well, if I could, you know, launch an appeal to you, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=57.42s)]
*  I can only say that you will be the most welcome in Brazil. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=60.22s)]
*  You will be an excellent counterpart [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  to the other vehicles or outlets. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=65.1s)]
*  There are very few media outlets that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=67.26s)]
*  are really unbiased in Brazil. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=69.06s)]
*  That's something we need. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=71.7s)]
*  And we do have one program in the Javan Pan Network [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=73.38s)]
*  called the Dots in the Eyes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=75.98s)]
*  The Dots in the Eyes, or the Dots on the Eyes, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=78.06s)]
*  and they're excellent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=81.1s)]
*  They really showcase the good things going on in this country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=82.22s)]
*  Flattering will admit that not speaking Portuguese [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=86.62s)]
*  could be a hurdle in the largest Portuguese-speaking country [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=89.34s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=91.78s)]
*  But to the question of free speech, which really is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=93.06s)]
*  the acid test, do you have free speech or don't you? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=95.14s)]
*  Well, it's a really simple test. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=97.66000000000001s)]
*  You have free speech when you can say something [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  that most people consider offensive or outrageous, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=101.78s)]
*  a view that is held by very few people, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  and not be punished for saying it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  That's what free speech is. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  Does Brazil have free speech? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=111.42s)]
*  Well, earlier this year, perhaps the most popular podcaster [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=113.06s)]
*  in the country, a guy known as Monarch, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=116.3s)]
*  played out a thought experiment on his show [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=119.74s)]
*  in which he said, you know, even extremist parties [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=121.74s)]
*  should be recognized by law in Brazil. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  Not that I'm for them, but you should be allowed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=126.1s)]
*  to have any political party you want [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=129.06s)]
*  because that's what freedom is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=130.38s)]
*  In response to saying this, the Attorney General of Brazil [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=132.18s)]
*  opened an investigation into Monarch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=134.54s)]
*  He was fired and kicked off of YouTube. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=136.46s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald saw this happen in real time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=138.78s)]
*  He knows Brazil well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=141.14s)]
*  He's lived here for 17 years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=141.98s)]
*  He's an independent journalist with an emphasis [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=143.54s)]
*  on freedom and he's an independent, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=145.26s)]
*  and he joins us tonight with his assessment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=146.3s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=147.78s)]
*  So I was really struck. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=149.14s)]
*  There's so much about Brazil that's amazing and impressive, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=150.9s)]
*  and I understand why you moved here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  But the question of free speech, media freedom, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=155.54s)]
*  how does that stand when you say now in Brazil? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=158.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think one of the benefits [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=160.74s)]
*  of living in a foreign country for a while [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=162.34s)]
*  is that you see some of the flaws of your country, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=164.5s)]
*  but you also see a lot of the really good sides. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  And one of the things that exists in the United States [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=170.02s)]
*  that doesn't exist in a lot of other countries, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=172.66s)]
*  including Brazil, is a more pluralistic media [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=174.22s)]
*  than is available in a lot of other places. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=177.54s)]
*  Even if it's just Fox News and other right-wing outlets, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=179.38s)]
*  some places, as you just said, have none. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=182.22s)]
*  Here in Brazil, the country has been notoriously dominated [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=184.78s)]
*  by four or five industrialized families [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=188.18s)]
*  who control almost all media, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=190.3s)]
*  and their overarching ideology really is neither right [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=192.06s)]
*  nor left, but preservation of establishment power [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=194.78s)]
*  and ruling class orthodoxy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=197.1s)]
*  And they've had a block on mainstream discourse for so long. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=198.98s)]
*  The question of free speech as well, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  when Monarch, that podcast host that you just referenced, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=205.38s)]
*  said, I think the government shouldn't have the power [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=209.78s)]
*  to ban certain political parties, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=212.66s)]
*  to me, that is completely uncontroversial. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=214.26s)]
*  That's the state of the law in the United States [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=216.5s)]
*  because of our constitution. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=218.1s)]
*  And when I defended him, one of the very few people who did, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  I was treated like a leper. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=223.18s)]
*  You know, people saying, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=224.66s)]
*  this freedom of speech is a fascist ideology [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=226.34s)]
*  and we don't want it here, which is so ironic, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=228.94s)]
*  given that the hallmark of actual fascists is censorship, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=231.74s)]
*  not free inquiry and free discourse. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  And it's even more ironic, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=237.86s)]
*  given that a lot of people on the left [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=239.06s)]
*  who don't believe in free speech here, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  seem to trust either the government, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=242.34s)]
*  currently run by President Bolsonaro, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=244.78s)]
*  or American billionaires who control big tech, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=247.22s)]
*  who they seem to be comfortable [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=250.34s)]
*  controlling their political discourse. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  What's interesting, and I should say, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=253.46s)]
*  because I don't think our audience knows, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  you did more than complain about the censorship [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=256.74s)]
*  of this podcast, or you helped him get a new job. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=258.86s)]
*  So bless you for that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=261.26s)]
*  But the question of American media is important here [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=263.62s)]
*  because Bolsonaro, no matter what you think of him, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=266.42s)]
*  relies pretty much exclusively [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=268.3s)]
*  on American-owned tech platforms, Twitter specifically, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=270.06s)]
*  to get his message out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=274.06s)]
*  Doesn't that make him totally vulnerable [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  to censorship by American companies? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=278.46s)]
*  Well, he has been repeatedly censored by big tech platforms. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=280.82s)]
*  He, when speaking about COVID, was often censored. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  When speaking about the upcoming election, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  is often censored. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=288.94s)]
*  So Facebook and Google are essentially [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=290.18s)]
*  dictating to Brazilians what they can and can't hear, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=292.02s)]
*  including from their own democratically-elected president. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  And again, no matter what you think of Bolsonaro, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=297.97999999999996s)]
*  you should have to think that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=299.9s)]
*  that's a pretty serious problem. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=301.14s)]
*  And I think it's a very similar dynamic [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=303.38s)]
*  to what has happened in the US, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=304.9s)]
*  where the entire establishment [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=306.14s)]
*  essentially united against Trump. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=308.58s)]
*  And so all these institutions that liberals and the left [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=310.14s)]
*  and the United States have long held with such contempt, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=312.86s)]
*  neocons and the security state and corporate media, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  all united against Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  And suddenly they were viewed with such favor [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  by the American left and by American liberalism. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=323.02s)]
*  That has happened to a large extent here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  Brazilian leftists will now often talk about Globo, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=326.7s)]
*  long, worst enemy of the Brazilian left, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=329.73999999999995s)]
*  with a lot of gratitude and admiration. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=333.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's the major media company [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=335.61999999999995s)]
*  that has become completely hostile to Bolsonaro, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=338.02s)]
*  because again, Bolsonaro ran on a platform [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  of anti-establishment challenge and defiance. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  And that's not what his government is, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=346.73999999999995s)]
*  but just the rhetoric itself [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=348.54s)]
*  has made the establishment turn against him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=349.94s)]
*  Amazing, amazing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=352.1s)]
*  The parallels here in Brazil, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  we just recommend to everyone come and spend a week here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=354.62s)]
*  It's just, it's a remarkable reflection of our own society. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  Great to be with you, Dr. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=360.82000000000005s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlI2nX93UA&t=361.90000000000003s)]
