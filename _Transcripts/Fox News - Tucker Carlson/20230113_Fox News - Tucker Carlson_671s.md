# Tucker Carlson: You aren't allowed to know what the government is doing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight it is Friday, so we are thrilled to be able to open the show tonight with some [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=2.52s)]
*  rare good news. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=7.4s)]
*  That doesn't happen very often, and when it does, we celebrate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=8.72s)]
*  One of the main problems with the U.S. government is that there's no way to know exactly what [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=12.24s)]
*  it's doing, because you're not allowed to know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=15.68s)]
*  More than a billion federal documents, a billion, have been declared classified, and that means [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=18.56s)]
*  they're off limits to you and all other ordinary American citizens who don't work for the government. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=23.54s)]
*  You're not allowed to see them, despite the fact they belong to you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=28.72s)]
*  Now no matter what you may have heard, the point of the system is not to protect the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=32.4s)]
*  country from foreign adversaries. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=35.92s)]
*  Under the Biden administration, we don't even bother to do that anymore. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=38.4s)]
*  No. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=41.36s)]
*  The point of the system is to take power from the voters and the officials they elect and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=42.36s)]
*  hand that power to the permanent bureaucracy in Washington. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=46.76s)]
*  It's infuriating, and over time it is dangerous. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=50.76s)]
*  But for once, we can report some meaningful pushback against this regime of secrecy and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=54.28s)]
*  deceit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=59.04s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy of California became speaker of the House last week, last Friday, and in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=60.4s)]
*  one of his first big policy changes, he is pledging to let Americans see, quote, all [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=64.16s)]
*  that happened at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=69.72s)]
*  That means finally releasing the roughly 14,000 hours of surveillance footage from that day [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=74.0s)]
*  that as of tonight remain hidden. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=79.8s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=82.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think the public should see what has happened on that day. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=83.56s)]
*  I've watched what Nancy Pelosi did, where she politicized it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=86.36s)]
*  Where for the first time in the history as a speaker, not allowing the minority to appoint [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=91.08s)]
*  to a committee, to pick and choose. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=96.28s)]
*  We watched the politicization of this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=98.56s)]
*  I think the American public should actually see all what happened instead of a report [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=100.96s)]
*  that's written for a political basis. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=104.6s)]
*  And I think the answer. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=107.0s)]
*  We're looking through that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=108.56s)]
*  I want to be very thoughtful about it, but yes, I'm engaged to do that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=109.56s)]
*  Well, yeah, after two full years, after a highly publicized and highly politicized congressional [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=114.16s)]
*  committee, after endless grandstanding in the media, after unprecedented political crackdowns, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=120.52s)]
*  after nearly 1,000 arrests, after all of that, Americans, yes, they do have a right to know [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  what actually happened on January 6. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=132.8s)]
*  That's what Kevin McCarthy said. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=135.6s)]
*  Who could argue otherwise? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=138.04s)]
*  What's the counterargument? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, there is one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  And Democrats have been making it in court, and that's why the footage from that day is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=142.68s)]
*  still hidden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=145.96s)]
*  Here's an actual quote from an actual brief filed in an actual federal court by an actual [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=147.4s)]
*  left-wing U.S. attorney called Channing Phillips. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Quote, national security interests could be harmed by the disclosure of the sealed CCTV [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=155.72s)]
*  videos from the Capitol. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Once the capabilities of a U.S. Capitol interior surveillance camera, including its position [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=164.52s)]
*  and whether it pans, tilts, or zooms, is disclosed to the public via the release of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=169.12s)]
*  a single video from that camera, the cat is out of the bag. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  So that's it right there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  You can't know whether the Capitol's surveillance cameras pan, tilt, or zoom. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=180.72s)]
*  And if you do know, America is in peril. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=188.24s)]
*  It's completely absurd. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=192.12s)]
*  Every human movement in the United States Capitol is recorded by cameras, and you already [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  knew that because the same is true in virtually every public building in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=198.04s)]
*  That is not a secret. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=202.48s)]
*  And of course, it's not the secret the Democrats fear you might learn if you saw the tape. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=203.48s)]
*  They're probably a lot more concerned about whether you'll discover how many law enforcement [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=209.12s)]
*  agents actively helped January 6 protesters enter the building that day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  Some of them definitely did. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=217.72s)]
*  We know that for a fact because we have the tape. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=218.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=221.76s)]
*  Police are squabbling with protesters. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=222.76s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=227.48s)]
*  And they just breached the Capitol again. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=233.48s)]
*  So you saw the barricades come down in front of the Capitol. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=237.48s)]
*  In some cases, it was not actually the police who took them down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  But we still don't know the identity of the people who did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=242.88s)]
*  Why don't we? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=245.76s)]
*  Well, Julie Kelly has just reported on a remarkable moment in the ongoing trial of a man called [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=246.76s)]
*  Richard Barnett. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=251.82s)]
*  Barnett is the man photographed with his feet, famously on Nancy Pelosi's desks, on January 6. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=253.64s)]
*  Under cross-examination for Barnett's defense lawyer this week, a U.S. Capitol police commander [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=258.64s)]
*  called Carnesia Mendoza admitted that unidentified but apparently highly trained agent provocateurs [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=264.36s)]
*  were leading the crowd that day. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=272.8s)]
*  Here's the exchange. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=275.84s)]
*  The defense attorney asks, quote, would it be fair to say that at least some of the leading [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  edges of that crowd, they contained bad people or provocateurs? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=281.56s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=284.8s)]
*  Mendoza's response, quote, it's fair. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=285.8s)]
*  Mendoza went on to confirm that these provocateurs were, quote, highly trained, violent people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=290.04s)]
*  who work together and coordinate together. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=294.52s)]
*  Well, that's a remarkable admission. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=297.4s)]
*  But who were these people? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=300.42s)]
*  Under oath, the director of the FBI has refused to deny that these provocateurs were working [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=302.72s)]
*  with federal law enforcement. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=307.02s)]
*  Indeed, Christopher Wray of the FBI has refused to confirm or deny that FBI agents dressed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  as Trump supporters and breached the Capitol. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=313.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Did you have confidential human sources dressed as Trump supporters inside the Capitol on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  January 6 prior to the doors being opened? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=321.76s)]
*  Again, I had to be very careful. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=324.88s)]
*  It should be a no. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=326.68s)]
*  Can you not tell the American people? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=328.28s)]
*  No. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=330.24s)]
*  We did not have confidential human sources dressed as Trump supporters positioned inside [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=331.24s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=335.76s)]
*  The gentleman's time has expired. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=336.76s)]
*  You should not read anything into my decision not to share information. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=338.0s)]
*  Director Wray, gentleman's time has expired. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's just completely outrageous. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=345.76s)]
*  First, it seems very obvious the FBI did have confidential sources dressed as Trump supporters [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=348.76s)]
*  inside the Capitol. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=354.0s)]
*  But the fact is we have, as Americans, have an absolute right to know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=355.92s)]
*  How many FBI agents or informants participated in the January 6th riots? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=360.78s)]
*  Why can't we know? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=364.8s)]
*  There's no good reason. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=367.04s)]
*  FBI Director Christopher Wray wants to keep the surveillance footage hidden so we can't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=368.04s)]
*  know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=373.12s)]
*  Again, the real secret here is not whether the cameras in the Capitol pan, tilt, or zoom. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=374.12s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=380.24s)]
*  The real secret is what really happened there. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=382.6s)]
*  So for two years, the Department of Justice has fought the release of this footage. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=385.16s)]
*  But still, some of that footage has emerged. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=389.48s)]
*  Take a look at this tape. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=391.88s)]
*  It was obtained by BuzzFeed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=392.88s)]
*  It was released only after a federal judge rejected the DOJ's claim that this particular [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=394.12s)]
*  footage needed to stay secret on, quote, national security grounds. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  The footage covers a 15-minute period on January 6th from 2.25 p.m. to 2.40 p.m. Eastern Time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=405.84s)]
*  Now that's right in the middle of the so-called insurrection. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=413.24s)]
*  For context, 2.26 p.m. is around when Mike Pence, then the Vice President, was evacuated [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=416.74s)]
*  from the Capitol. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=422.28s)]
*  These are images from a surveillance camera at the Senate wing of the complex. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=423.68s)]
*  And they show people calmly walking around taking pictures. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=428.36s)]
*  Not much of a riot. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=431.12s)]
*  Now that's relevant because the DOJ is charging some of the people who entered the Capitol [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=432.92s)]
*  around this time, probably including some of the people in those frames, with endangering [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=436.64s)]
*  the safety of Mike Pence. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=440.8s)]
*  They're saying the Capitol itself was a restricted area because Mike Pence was present. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=443.64s)]
*  But it does not appear from that footage that it's true. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=448.64s)]
*  Where exactly was Mike Pence at the time? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=452.36s)]
*  People are doing jail time as a result of assumptions about that question. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  But the rest of us can't verify it because the surveillance footage is still classified [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  for national security reasons. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=466.1s)]
*  We should see it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=468.88s)]
*  That footage might also show when exactly Capitol police officers began CPR on Roseanne [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=470.44s)]
*  Boylan, one Trump supporter who died that day. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=475.76s)]
*  And that would be important to know as well for her family and for the rest of us. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  We might also learn about why one Capitol Hill police officer on January 6th, the man [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=482.96s)]
*  called Khalid Johnson, was wearing a MAGA hat as he seemed to coordinate with some of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=487.44s)]
*  the protesters. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=492.08s)]
*  That footage was shot by journalist Ford Fischer. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=493.74s)]
*  You're seeing an image of it on your screen right now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=496.2s)]
*  And maybe we'll learn more about the Chewbacca guy, the guy in the Viking hat, his activities [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=498.88s)]
*  during January 6th. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=503.5s)]
*  He's the man now serving almost four years behind bars for declining a police officer's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=505.16s)]
*  half-hearted request that he take the party elsewhere. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=509.88000000000005s)]
*  Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=535.16s)]
*  We will. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=539.48s)]
*  I've been making sure I ain't disrespecting the place. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=540.48s)]
*  Okay, just wanted to let you guys know this is like the sacredest place. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=542.48s)]
*  More than half of all murders in the United States are not solved at this point because [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=546.8s)]
*  law enforcement, including federal law enforcement, can't get its act together sufficient to solve [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  those murders. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=555.56s)]
*  And that guy has had his life destroyed and is spending 41 months in prison. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=557.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=562.76s)]
*  Did he do something we're not aware of? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=564.48s)]
*  The surveillance footage would show us and answer that question. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=566.64s)]
*  But big picture, if you don't want another January 6th, if you want to avoid another [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  riot like that, you'd want as much of the footage to come out as possible. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  Instead, our government has been using the information blackout it claims is necessary [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=579.52s)]
*  for national security in order to do what they usually do under the cover of classification [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=583.8199999999999s)]
*  law and that's lie to us. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=588.24s)]
*  Joe Biden just claimed on camera that right-wing insurrectionists, racists, killed a Capitol [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=590.68s)]
*  police officer called William Evans. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  William Evans, of course, was murdered at a checkpoint by a supporter of the Nation [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=598.2399999999999s)]
*  of Islam. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=602.04s)]
*  Three months after January 6th, while they're still cordoning off the Capitol because threats [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=603.04s)]
*  by these sick insurrectionists continued to be profligated on the Internet. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=608.84s)]
*  Again, all America saw what happened, what Officer Evans was killed defending a checkpoint [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=619.88s)]
*  you'd had to go through to get up to the Capitol because of these god awful sick threats. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=629.44s)]
*  All thrives in secrecy. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=637.4s)]
*  That used to be obvious to all Americans. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=639.84s)]
*  We have a right to know and moreover, transparency is the only solution. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=643.16s)]
*  And it looks like we're going to get some. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=649.84s)]
*  And that's thanks to the new speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and to the small group of Republicans [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=652.52s)]
*  who pushed him in that direction. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=656.6s)]
*  Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnrCy3yLLQ&t=658.52s)]
