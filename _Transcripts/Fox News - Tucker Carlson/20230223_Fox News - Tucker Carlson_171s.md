# Professor warns Tucker of ‘very troubling patterns in society’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k)
*  Well, under the term equity, Joe Biden has made racial discrimination, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=0.0s)]
*  open racial discrimination mandatory at all levels of the federal government. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=3.96s)]
*  That's illegal. It's completely immoral. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=7.16s)]
*  Most Americans oppose it, hate it, but very few lawyers have organized to stop it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=9.6s)]
*  Bill Jacobson is one who might actually do that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=15.08s)]
*  He's president of the of legal insurrection. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=17.6s)]
*  He's announcing tonight an initiative called the Equal Protection Project [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=19.68s)]
*  devoted to fair treatment of all Americans under the law without regard to race. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=23.04s)]
*  The group's guiding principle is there is no good racism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  It's at EqualProtection.org and we are honored to have Bill Jacobson join us tonight [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=31.84s)]
*  to explain what it is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=35.64s)]
*  Bill Jacobson, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=37.2s)]
*  Lay this out for us, if you would. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=38.68s)]
*  Sure, Tucker. Thanks for having me on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=41.4s)]
*  So we're starting EqualProtect.org, the Equal Protection Project, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=43.32s)]
*  because we're seeing very troubling patterns in society. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Our highest ideal as a society is enshrined in the Constitution, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=50.92s)]
*  the Fourteenth Amendment, in federal, state and local law. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Which is you do not discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=58.2s)]
*  And we're seeing that, unfortunately, under the concept of equity, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=62.28s)]
*  that there is outright discrimination on the basis of race. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=66.08s)]
*  A perfect example is in Providence, Rhode Island, where I'm located right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=69.64s)]
*  The Providence School District, the largest in Rhode Island, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=74.12s)]
*  is funded a program for teacher loan forgiveness, new teacher loan forgiveness, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=77.84s)]
*  funded by the Rhode Island Foundation, the largest charity in Rhode Island. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=84.0s)]
*  There's one catch to it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=88.76s)]
*  You cannot apply unless you are non-white. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=90.2s)]
*  So they are openly discriminating against new white teachers with this program. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=93.24s)]
*  And nobody seems to blink an eye at it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=98.2s)]
*  We have filed a federal complaint about it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=100.44s)]
*  We're pursuing it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=102.84s)]
*  But nobody is challenging this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=104.12s)]
*  The governor is no place to be found. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=105.8s)]
*  The attorney general is no place to be found. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=107.88s)]
*  This is a government program to discriminate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=111.16s)]
*  And unfortunately, that's what has happened to the equity agenda. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  And we're getting reports from around the country of these sort of problems. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=117.64s)]
*  So we are organizing to investigate these things, to expose them, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=121.28s)]
*  and if necessary, to litigate them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  And one of the things we're doing, and you can sign up at our website [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  if you're a lawyer who wants to help in this effort, at equalprotect.org, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=131.36s)]
*  a lawyer's network, because this has to be a national effort. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=135.56s)]
*  As you mentioned, the Biden administration is behind it also. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=140.16s)]
*  So that's what we're doing, and we ask people to come and visit and join us. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=145.24s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just let them construct a new Jim Crow and ignore it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=149.12s)]
*  And thank you for soliciting the help of other lawyers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=152.12s)]
*  This needs an organized framework, and I think you're providing it, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=154.32s)]
*  and we appreciate it. Bill Jacobson, thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=156.88s)]
*  Great, thank you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=159.76s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ZdGkeVs2k&t=170.12s)]
