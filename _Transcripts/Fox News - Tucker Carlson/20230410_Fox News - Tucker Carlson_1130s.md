# Tucker: They canâ€™t keep this secret forever
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=0.0s)]
*  Imagine being a historian a hundred years now, trying to figure out what happened here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=2.56s)]
*  There are a lot of questions that are going to puzzle you, but one of the most baffling will be, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=7.68s)]
*  how did Joe Biden get the Democratic nomination in 2020? 2020 was the year you will remember when [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=12.72s)]
*  we learned that white people are bad and systemic racism is responsible for everything that has gone [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=19.76s)]
*  wrong in the world. And yet 2020 was also the year the Democrats nominated by their free choice [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=24.24s)]
*  an elderly white man from a slave state who'd once eulogized a clan recruiter. So the anti-white party [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=31.68s)]
*  picked the white guy. How did that happen? Well, it's pretty simple. Democrats care about power [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=38.8s)]
*  and power derives from winning. When you lose, you don't have power. And Bernie Sanders couldn't win. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=45.2s)]
*  Sanders terrified the donor class. So Democrats went with Joe Biden, who loves the donor class [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=50.96s)]
*  and is loved by them. And from a fundraising perspective, that turned out to be a wise choice. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=56.64s)]
*  By the end of that cycle, Democrats had spent a total of $8.4 billion. That includes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  $400 million just from Mark Zuckerberg. And that total does not even include the tens of billions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=69.2s)]
*  in free media coverage as slick and dishonest as any paid ad, but that unlike paid ads, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=76.16s)]
*  is not regulated by campaign finance law. So if you add all of that up, the Democratic party dropped [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=82.64s)]
*  more in that presidential year than the entire annual GDP of most African countries, all to dislodge [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=88.64s)]
*  Donald Trump from the White House. Nothing like that has ever happened. Can they do it again? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=96.32s)]
*  That's the question before us. And it's a tougher question this round. Two and a half years ago, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=102.48s)]
*  many voters could tell themselves that Joe Biden might unite the country. Some mistook his dementia [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  for moderation, but no one can make that mistake now. With the American economy in decline and the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=112.56s)]
*  rest of the world in obvious chaos, Biden's going to have to come up with a whole new set of lies [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  in order to keep his job. And that's not an easy thing. And that may explain why as of mid April [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=123.28s)]
*  2023, where we are now, Joe Biden still has not formally announced his reelection campaign. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=129.44s)]
*  He was asked about it this morning on NBC. Here he is sounding less than all in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=136.16s)]
*  He can barely speak the words. We're not prepared to announce it yet, he says with his eyes closed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=159.44s)]
*  Well, why aren't they announcing it? Well, you know why. He's going to be 82 by the next inauguration [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=166.16s)]
*  and no one really other than his wife thinks that's a good idea because it's not. So where does that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=171.68s)]
*  leave Democrats? Well, if you're a rational person who took them at their word, you would assume the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=176.48s)]
*  party, the Democratic party would replace Joe Biden with someone who embodies their highest values. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=182.64s)]
*  You imagine a trans black woman with a background in corporate HR, or a Latinx drag queen with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=188.32s)]
*  purple hair and lots of face piercings, or maybe even Kamala Harris. But no, in fact, no chance. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  That would be principled and therefore they will never do it. Nominating someone you say you support? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=202.64s)]
*  No. When Biden leaves or more likely is shoved aside, they're going to nominate another straight [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=208.48s)]
*  white man who loves the big banks. Someone even oilier and faker than Joe Biden. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=214.24s)]
*  Why would they do that? Because it worked last time. And we're guessing if we had to bet tonight, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=222.56s)]
*  it's going to be Gavin Newsom. We can't say that for certain, but we have noticed Gavin Newsom was [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=227.36s)]
*  at the White House not long ago and Joe Biden wasn't just kind of measuring the curtains. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  And then over the weekend, we saw this, Gavin Newsom sitting down with the Democratic party's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=237.68s)]
*  former spokeswoman, now in residence at MSNBC, Jen Psaki. Psaki didn't conduct really an interview, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=242.24s)]
*  she's not a journalist. She gave Newsom instead a chance to outline his platform for when he takes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=250.56s)]
*  complete control. So don't dismiss him. You may be in the habit of dismissing Gavin Newsom. Pay [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=256.0s)]
*  close attention as he gives his pitch on MSNBC. You know, I just finished 18 events in five days [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=261.92s)]
*  in California. I've sacrificed my heart and soul for my state and I take a back seat to no one on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=269.84s)]
*  that. So I get it. But I also don't get what's going on in this country. I don't get why everybody's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=275.11999999999995s)]
*  not doing what we're doing. All the progress the last half century has been rolled back [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=281.2s)]
*  in these states in real time. Just the last few years, I don't think people fully understand [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=285.52s)]
*  the rights regression, individual liberties on civil rights, on voting rights, on the gerrymandering [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=291.12s)]
*  that's happening out here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=297.2s)]
*  Is your brain exploding? If you're a literal person, maybe. So this is the guy who forced [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=302.56s)]
*  every one of his 40 million residents in his state to get an experimental vaccine, whether they wanted [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=308.8s)]
*  to or not, lecturing you about individual rights and civil liberties. Quote, I don't get why [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=314.48s)]
*  everyone isn't doing what we're doing in California, he says. Maybe because it's not working? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=320.96s)]
*  Because the people who live in your state who can afford to leave have? More people have left [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=326.4s)]
*  California this year than any state in the country. California, the largest net emigration [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=331.52s)]
*  in the United States. They actually ran out of U-Hauls. It was that bad. So you have a mixture of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=338.4s)]
*  billionaires and desperately poor people who are dependent upon the state. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=344.88s)]
*  Kind of like Latin America. That's exactly the economic structure increasingly of the state of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  California. It's not a place of promise. And you know that because middle-class people with families [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=356.32s)]
*  aren't moving there. That's how you know. Is your state doing the right thing? Well, people who [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=361.76s)]
*  haven't made it but would like to would be moving there. Not fleeing from tearing down their [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=366.88s)]
*  countries or desperate poverty in Central America, but from other parts of America. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=372.24s)]
*  Are they moving there? No, they're not. Where are they going? Well, actually, they're going to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=376.0s)]
*  Florida. That's not a political point. It's just true. And it's measurable. So you'd think if you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=379.12s)]
*  were a normal person and you were running California, you'd think, what are they doing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=383.92s)]
*  in Florida that we should be doing? No, not Gavin Newsom. And this is the key to his appeal [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=387.04s)]
*  to Democratic leaders. Like Joe Biden, he will literally say anything and then he'll take it to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=392.88s)]
*  11 and lecture the person who's doing a better job than he is on how he's a bad person. Watch [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=397.92s)]
*  Newsom tell the governor of Florida how to run a state. There was a pretty startling split screen. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  You had a thousand kids in Nashville out there protesting the lack of action on gun reform [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=411.84s)]
*  measures while you had Governor DeSantis signing a bill on permanentless carry behind closed doors. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  What did you make of that? Scared to death. Who is he scared of? Scared of the people. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=426.96s)]
*  Scared of the people in Florida? Yeah, that overwhelmingly oppose that position. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=432.08s)]
*  I think the majority of NRA members, you know, probably oppose that position. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=435.76s)]
*  This is what happens when everything about you from your physical features to your very soul [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=442.32s)]
*  has been altered by cosmetic surgery, just like Joe Biden, but younger. You'll say literally [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=448.96s)]
*  anything. Words have no connection to reality. There's no expectation that you're describing [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=455.67999999999995s)]
*  something real. You're merely using words as a tool to gain power. That's terrifying. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=460.96s)]
*  It's dishonest to its core. So you just heard Gavin Newsom say that only leaders who are, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=467.92s)]
*  quote, scared of the people, let the people carry firearms. They're so scared of the people, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=472.8s)]
*  they let them defend themselves. By contrast, when you're a completely legitimate leader [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=479.44s)]
*  presiding over a system that's not rigged, you start confiscating guns. You live in a state where [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=484.24s)]
*  only the governor's bodyguards can be armed. It's like what you're seeing here is not just the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  triumph of packaging over reality, but the triumph of dishonesty over truth. That's so dishonest [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=498.0s)]
*  that he's not even trying to convince you. He's trying to reshape reality itself. By the way, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  why wouldn't he? If men can become women, then why wouldn't everything Gavin Newsom says be true? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  Just because he said it. So what's the effect on the actual state, our largest state, the prettiest [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=519.84s)]
*  state, what was for decades the economic engine of the United States, California? What has been the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=526.0s)]
*  effect of Gavin Newsom's leadership on that state? Well, this has been well chronicled. Newsom has [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=531.44s)]
*  been the governor of California, beat a recall recently since 2019 for four years. Before that, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  he ran San Francisco where he's from. So how's San Francisco doing? Under good leadership, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  San Francisco would be thriving. But under Gavin Newsom's leadership, well, here's what's happening [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=550.72s)]
*  in San Francisco. Friends identify the victim as Don Carmignani, a former San Francisco fire [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=556.32s)]
*  commissioner. He suffered a fractured skull, broken jaw, and lots of lacerations to his face and head. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  Carmignani showed up to his mother's place after they refused to move. Soon they picked up and put [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  down near the corner laundry mat. Carmignani confronted them and that, they say, is what [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  provoked the brutal beating, the crime angering and traumatizing those who heard or saw it all [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=579.12s)]
*  unfold. So I moved here because I love this city and it's becoming more and more disturbing to live [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=585.28s)]
*  here. Yeah, they just closed today, actually, a Whole Foods in downtown San Francisco. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=592.96s)]
*  Not a mom and pop place, a Whole Foods, a well-backed, in fact, owned by Amazon [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=600.8s)]
*  company, biggest company in the world, owns the grocery store and they still had to close it, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  a grocery store that caters to rich people in one of the richest cities in the world. And they had [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=612.48s)]
*  to close it because why? Because the people who worked there were too afraid for their own physical [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=616.08s)]
*  safety to show up for work. So that's what's happening in San Francisco. By the way, last week, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=620.32s)]
*  Bob Lee, the founder of Cash App, was murdered, stabbed to death on the street, and what they [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  tell us is one of the nicest parts of San Francisco. And then apparently, according to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=629.7600000000001s)]
*  surveillance video, the guy who murdered him, randomly, just murdered him on principle, I guess, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=634.24s)]
*  walked down the street completely at ease, pulling a rolling bag behind him because he has nothing [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=639.36s)]
*  to fear because there are no cops. This is a state in which crime has been legalized [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=644.4s)]
*  and the only crimes are now thought crimes. If you disagree with the people in charge, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  then you're in serious trouble. But if you hurt others or steal, you're fine. You're part of a [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=656.56s)]
*  protected class. That's the definition of tyranny. And there are still some people in California who [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=662.16s)]
*  understand that. Here's one sheriff in Riverside County. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=667.6s)]
*  Increasingly more violent and brazen. What we are seeing in response to these very lax laws on [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=674.64s)]
*  crime, the push to decriminalize everything, the push to lessen the penalty for something or even [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=683.92s)]
*  take away the penalty for crime, is basically emboldening criminals to do more. It's really [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=691.12s)]
*  horrifying for law enforcement and it's horrifying for the public that has to deal with it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=697.76s)]
*  So here's our guess. We don't know the guy, but we would bet money that the second that man is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=705.28s)]
*  vested in his pension, in other words, the second he can leave, he'll be in Idaho or Arizona [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  or anywhere other than that state because you can't live in a state like that unless you're rich, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=716.16s)]
*  of course. So if you cared about the state of California, you would do something about this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=721.28s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom has completely ignored the condition of his state physically, it's now [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  filthy, or the lives of the people who live there. Instead, he's doing what they all do, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=734.56s)]
*  which is doubling down on identity politics. Pandering to people on the basis of their skin [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=739.36s)]
*  color, their sexual orientation or whatever. And because ultimately he is a stiff robotic [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  lizard man, he's doing it in the most awkward possible way. Here he is, April 5th, at the new [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=753.84s)]
*  College of Florida, because he is running for president, trying his best to seem interested [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=759.2800000000001s)]
*  as he claps along to an ethnic song and dance. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  So, you want to know if he's running for president? Well, he flew to Florida to degrade himself on camera. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=766.96s)]
*  And self-abasement is the number one requirement of politics. You have to be willing to leave your [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=772.48s)]
*  dignity at the door. And for Gavin Newsom, that's easy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=778.48s)]
*  And he's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=782.32s)]
*  He's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  So, if your first reaction to that is to recoil in revulsion and turn off your television set, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=791.76s)]
*  then you're the threat to democracy. Normal people are the threat to democracy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=801.76s)]
*  Newsom's campaign ad, and this is the first of his presidential campaign ads we predict, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=806.8s)]
*  makes that perfectly clear. Watch. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=811.92s)]
*  The problem in our country right now? Authoritarian leaders who are so hell-bent on gaining power and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=821.36s)]
*  keeping it by whatever means necessary that they're directly attacking our freedoms in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=827.28s)]
*  state after state. That's why I'm launching the Campaign for Democracy. We're going on the road [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=832.56s)]
*  to take the fight to states where freedom is most under attack, where Republican leaders ban books, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  criminalize doctors, fire teachers, intimidate librarians, kidnap migrants, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=844.4799999999999s)]
*  target trans kids, stoke racism, condone anti-Semitism, force the victims of rape [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=851.36s)]
*  and incest to carry their attacker's baby, where they ignore the will of the people. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=858.24s)]
*  They make it harder to vote and easier to buy assault weapons. We'll help lead the fight to [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=862.7199999999999s)]
*  make sure we elect leaders in 2024 who believe in democracy. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=868.16s)]
*  Oh, the huevos on that man. You got to give him credit. Everything in that ad is not only untrue, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=873.52s)]
*  it is the mirror image of the truth. It is the exact opposite of the truth. And it's therefore [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  not just misleading, it is evil. This is not a question of we disagree on something. This is [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=886.64s)]
*  a fact of someone flipping around the truth and inverting it. If you're opposed to men in [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=894.08s)]
*  dresses twerking in front of kids, you're intimidating librarians. If you pause before [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=901.44s)]
*  you say castrate children, you're targeting trans kids. And of course, if you're not with [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=906.72s)]
*  his program, you don't believe in democracy. You're promoting authoritarianism. This is the man [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=911.84s)]
*  who's governor of a state in which there really is no democracy, in which all the candidates and [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=916.64s)]
*  the election outcomes are chosen by the unions, which are in bed with the Democratic Party. He's [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=920.48s)]
*  a one party state. And the man who presides over a one party state is lecturing you about democracy? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=925.2s)]
*  Right. This is the guy who shut down the state of California and all of its schools for all the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=932.24s)]
*  poor people while he sent his children to in-person private schools and went to dinner at the most [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  expensive restaurant in the United States. Meanwhile, anyone who didn't get his creepy shot, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=943.44s)]
*  he compared to a criminal, to a criminal, to a drunk driver. Watch. And with all due respect, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=950.0s)]
*  you don't have a choice to go out and drink and drive and put everybody else's lives at risk. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=957.68s)]
*  That's the equivalent of this moment with the deadliness and efficiency of the Delta virus. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=963.6s)]
*  So that turned out to be completely untrue, completely provably untrue as a matter of [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=973.28s)]
*  science. And again, the literal among us are driven crazy by watching a videotape like that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=978.8s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom is not driven crazy. It doesn't bother him at all. He's never apologized. He's [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=985.12s)]
*  never revised what he said before. He just kept going. This is a man who will say anything. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=991.04s)]
*  And people who will say anything tend to be willing to do anything. And like Joe Biden, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=997.28s)]
*  he has consistently run as a moderate and falsely. Back in 2008, as mayor of San [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1003.28s)]
*  Francisco, he promised to eliminate homelessness within the city within 10 years. That, of course, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1008.48s)]
*  didn't work out. He's never apologized for that. In fact, homelessness has grown by double digits [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1013.04s)]
*  under his stewardship of the state. But if you want to understand who Gavin Newsom really is, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1019.36s)]
*  if you want to appreciate not just the dishonesty, but the deep malice at the core of him, the desire [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1025.36s)]
*  to hurt other people and the indifference to human suffering that has been the hallmark [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1030.96s)]
*  of his governorship, watch this clip from 2020 on sobriety. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1036.56s)]
*  Clean and sober is one of the biggest damn mistakes this country's ever made. I know it's a [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1043.68s)]
*  hold your hand idealistic point of view that somehow magically, I mean, God bless some of you. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1047.28s)]
*  If you're like me, I've been known to have a glass of wine at night watching some of the nightly news. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1052.08s)]
*  We all need to self-medicate periodically. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1056.96s)]
*  We all need to self-medicate periodically. Well, now we have a country in which virtually everyone [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1058.8s)]
*  is self-medicating all the time, very often with the help of doctors. And nowhere is it worse than [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1065.6s)]
*  the state of California. If you cared about the people who lived in the state of California, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1071.76s)]
*  you would notice this. Nearly 30,000 Californians die every single year from drugs and alcohol. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1075.52s)]
*  That's the most of any state. To put it in perspective, that is close to 10 times as [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1081.76s)]
*  many people who die every year from gunfire. And of course, addiction is the central driver [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1086.08s)]
*  of homelessness, which has not only made the state ugly and dangerous and unlivable, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  but has also destroyed the lives of the people who are living on the streets. What about them? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1098.56s)]
*  Gavin Newsom doesn't care. Quote, clean and sober is one of the biggest damn mistakes this country [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1102.24s)]
*  ever made. Really? If you're willing to say that, if you care so little about the people who live [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  in your state, that you will mock their sobriety, then you're definitely running for president. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbk31a5h0RU&t=1113.12s)]
