# Tucker Carlson: Immigration and crime are issues Republicans should run on
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=0.0s)]
*  For all the bad things going on, there are on the other side, Joe Biden's approval ratings, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=2.08s)]
*  which are a nonstop source of joy for us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=6.72s)]
*  And if you've seen them recently, you know in your heart exactly how the November elections [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=8.92s)]
*  are going to turn out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=12.96s)]
*  Biden's obviously been a disaster for the country, but not only has he made the U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=14.6s)]
*  poor, weaker, and much more ridiculous, people know that he has. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  And they tell pollsters about it all the time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=22.52s)]
*  Biden is the single least popular president in modern American history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=24.48s)]
*  At this point, absolutely nobody is impressed by Joe Biden, and that would be including [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=28.0s)]
*  Dr. Jill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=32.84s)]
*  So this is a big problem for the Biden family, obviously, but a much bigger problem even [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=33.84s)]
*  for the Democratic Party, which Joe Biden leads. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=37.36s)]
*  Unpopular presidents drag their parties to the bottom in midterm elections. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=40.4s)]
*  That's the unchanging rule of politics. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=45.2s)]
*  You saw it famously in 1994 with the Republican takeover of Congress after two disastrous [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=48.24s)]
*  years with Bill Clinton. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=53.04s)]
*  You saw it in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  You saw it in 2010 after Obamacare. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=57.28s)]
*  You saw it in 2018. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  So there's no question based on precedent that that's about to happen once again in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  2022, in November. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=66.12s)]
*  That's what everybody assumes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=67.8s)]
*  And in fact, it may well happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=69.36s)]
*  We're certainly praying for it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  But as of tonight, we have to be honest with you, the numbers don't show that happening. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=75.88s)]
*  In fact, all the indications we have right now suggest that despite Joe Biden's well-earned [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=76.88s)]
*  The Democratic Party still, again, as of tonight, has a strong chance of holding Congress in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=83.12s)]
*  November. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=89.12s)]
*  The prediction markets, which many believe are more accurate than the polls, overwhelmingly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  point to the Democrats keeping at least one chamber. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=94.84s)]
*  And maybe strangest of all, as of this week, Democrats are leading Republicans nationally [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=98.04s)]
*  in the so-called generic ballot by about four points. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  So if you ask people, which party do you like more? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=105.44s)]
*  They say Democrats. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=108.04s)]
*  Maybe that's why Democrats are raising a lot more money, too. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=110.28s)]
*  And not just money from their patrons in Big Tech, but from small dollar donors. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=112.68s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  In June, Democrats raised $64 million online from 4 million people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=118.64s)]
*  That same month, this June, Republicans raised only $26 million online from just over a million [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=123.58s)]
*  donors. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  From the first quarter to the second quarter of this year, donations to the Republican [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=130.6s)]
*  Party dropped by more than 12%. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  By contrast, donations to the Democratic Party are up more than 20%. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=136.6s)]
*  That is not good at all. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=141.32s)]
*  Not simply because you need money to run a political campaign, but because money is, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=142.68s)]
*  to some extent, a measure of commitment and intensity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  And you see the same dynamic playing out in individual races across the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=150.18s)]
*  For example, last quarter, Raphael Warnock, that would be the thoroughly mediocre Democratic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=153.92s)]
*  senator from Georgia, the guy who was caught on video appearing to commit spousal abuse, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=158.72s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=163.28s)]
*  That guy raised more than $12 million online. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=164.28s)]
*  His opponent, Herschel Walker, who everyone likes, raised less than half of that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=168.84s)]
*  So far, Raphael Warnock has raised an astounding amount of money. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=173.4s)]
*  He's hauled in more dollars online than seven Republican senatorial candidates combined. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Candidates in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, and Georgia [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=182.84s)]
*  combined. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Herschel Walker is now trailing Raphael Warnock by 10 points. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=188.44s)]
*  When this is happening in a state, they tell us went for Joe Biden by a margin of about [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=192.72s)]
*  1 third of a percentage point. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=197.08s)]
*  That is bizarre. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=200.16s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=201.52s)]
*  It's not just happening in Georgia. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=203.52s)]
*  According to the official numbers, you'll recall, Joe Biden won the state of Pennsylvania [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=205.32s)]
*  by a little over a single percentage point in 2020. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=208.92s)]
*  So it's been two years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=212.36s)]
*  Biden has become much less popular since then. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=214.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Pennsylvania, which is controlled by the Democratic Party, has become much worse, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=216.44s)]
*  far more chaotic and dangerous. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  Here was the scene in the state's largest city on Tuesday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Nearly 100 shots fired on 57th Street between Haverford and Westminster tonight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=227.56s)]
*  A sea of evidence markers lined this West Philly street telling of the potentially deadly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=232.44s)]
*  chaos that unfolded here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Responding officers found four victims on 57th Street. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=239.04s)]
*  Two shot in the head in critical condition tonight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=242.72s)]
*  One victim, we're told in a BMW, is an innocent bystander caught in gunfire and shot in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=245.28s)]
*  shoulder. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=250.68s)]
*  All while kids and young adults were on a nearby playground. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=251.68s)]
*  Over 100 shots right in the middle of the street. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=256.2s)]
*  It's hard to believe that's an American city. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=258.6s)]
*  It's hard to believe that's the place where our Constitution was written. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=260.52s)]
*  It's totally unacceptable. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=264.44s)]
*  And it wasn't organic. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=266.0s)]
*  It didn't just happen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=267.0s)]
*  This is a result of policies from the Democratic Party. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=268.36s)]
*  Period. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=271.68s)]
*  Now, you'd think, this being a democracy, that voters would punish anyone who had anything [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=272.68s)]
*  to do with turning Philadelphia into the disaster you just saw. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=277.54s)]
*  And John Fetterman certainly did have a hand in that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=281.14s)]
*  He's the sitting lieutenant governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=283.14s)]
*  Fetterman now wants a new job. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=286.82s)]
*  He's running for the U.S. Senate. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=287.98s)]
*  He's the candidate. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=290.38s)]
*  And in some ways, John Fetterman is the weakest possible candidate you could run. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=291.38s)]
*  He has, obviously, a very public record of failure. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=295.7s)]
*  He also had a devastating stroke this spring, which is sad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=298.74s)]
*  But it affected him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=302.3s)]
*  Here he is campaigning for Senate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=303.3s)]
*  Who can count on us to eliminate the filibuster? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  If you come out and step with us, we will be able to stand with you in D.C. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  And let's get some stuff done for America. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  I gave away the lieutenant governor governor in Pennsylvania, the only lieutenant governor [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=330.22s)]
*  in the history to do that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=334.66s)]
*  So this guy is everything you'd think wouldn't work. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=337.86s)]
*  He's radical, for one thing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=341.5s)]
*  Let's eliminate the filibuster. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=342.98s)]
*  Oh, good idea, John Fetterman. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=343.98s)]
*  He's implicated in the destruction of the state that he's still the lieutenant governor [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=346.38000000000005s)]
*  of. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=350.62s)]
*  And he's obviously impaired. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=352.18s)]
*  That's not an attack on him. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=353.18s)]
*  It's just true. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=354.18s)]
*  Watch him. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=355.18s)]
*  So you'd think there would be no way a guy like that could win a Senate seat. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=356.18s)]
*  And here's the sad news. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  John Fetterman is winning overwhelmingly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=362.58s)]
*  He currently has a double digit lead over his Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz, Dr. Oz. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=364.78s)]
*  The National Republican Senatorial Committee just slashed its spending in the state of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  Pennsylvania by more than $5 million, including their ad buys in the city of Philadelphia. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  That's a retreat. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=379.02s)]
*  And it's happening in a state that Republicans ought to be winning. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=380.26s)]
*  What is going on here and why is no one mentioning it? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=383.94s)]
*  Well, a couple of things are going on. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=386.5s)]
*  But first, let's hear from Mitch McConnell. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=388.82s)]
*  Mitch McConnell is the head Republican in the Senate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  He's not there because everyone likes him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=393.22s)]
*  McConnell has no close friends. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=394.82s)]
*  He's loved by no one. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=396.3s)]
*  But he's considered very smart. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=397.3s)]
*  He is a master tactician, as the dummies who cover politics for Politico and the Washington [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=399.58s)]
*  Post are always telling us. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=404.3s)]
*  In Washington, people are very much afraid of Mitch McConnell. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=406.06s)]
*  Cross him and he will hurt you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=409.3s)]
*  And they listen carefully to his political analysis because that's what he spent his [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=411.18s)]
*  life doing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=414.06s)]
*  That's the only thing he spent his life doing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=415.06s)]
*  So here's what Mitch McConnell says the problem is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=417.54s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=419.86s)]
*  There's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=420.86s)]
*  Senate races are just different. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=426.09999999999997s)]
*  They're statewide. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=427.42s)]
*  Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=431.02s)]
*  So there's the head Republican in the Senate conceding three months out that Republicans [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=435.74s)]
*  are probably not going to retake the Senate. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=444.26s)]
*  Well, the answer, of course, is in the final line you just heard. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=445.26s)]
*  Some of the candidates are mediocre. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=447.46s)]
*  That's Mitch McConnell's excuse. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=450.26s)]
*  And there's some truth in that, obviously. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=451.26s)]
*  Some of them are mediocre. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=452.73999999999995s)]
*  But compared to what? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=454.73999999999995s)]
*  Mediocre in the Congress? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=457.26s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=458.26s)]
*  Dianne Feinstein hasn't spoken a coherent sentence in years, hasn't had trouble getting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=459.26s)]
*  reelected. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=462.82s)]
*  Eric Swallow had sex with a Chinese spy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=463.82s)]
*  He's still there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=466.06s)]
*  So mediocre people get elected to office. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=467.64s)]
*  Lots and lots and lots of them do. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=471.09999999999997s)]
*  Every cycle. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  So what McConnell's analysis really is, of course, is buck passing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=475.66s)]
*  Don't blame me. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=478.78000000000003s)]
*  I didn't choose these people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  But they're still the nominees. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=483.16s)]
*  So if you want to save the country and move in a different direction, yes, using some [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=485.74s)]
*  mediocre people to do it, what are you going to do? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  No hint of what you might do for Mitch McConnell other than just accept the inevitable. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=494.58000000000004s)]
*  Now the truth is it's entirely possible Mitch McConnell doesn't want to retake the Senate [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=499.38s)]
*  because then you'd have to run things. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=504.06s)]
*  And there's one thing Republican leaders dislike. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=505.94s)]
*  It's running anything. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=507.58s)]
*  Much easier to complain on Fox News. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=508.9s)]
*  But if you actually wanted to win, what would you do? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=511.9s)]
*  Well, here's an idea. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=514.26s)]
*  Just kind of out of nowhere. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=515.26s)]
*  Just spitballing here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=516.26s)]
*  How about you run on issues that voters care about? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=517.26s)]
*  That might work even for a mediocre candidate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=520.3s)]
*  So let's say, again, just for the sake of argument, that you ran a campaign on illegal [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=523.02s)]
*  immigration and crime. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=527.26s)]
*  Now these are two issues that didn't just arise out of nowhere. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=530.14s)]
*  They're the product of policies the Democratic Party put in. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=532.86s)]
*  They were intentional outcomes. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  We have millions of people coming in illegally and we have a lot more murders than we had [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  two years ago. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=542.74s)]
*  These two issues, immigration and crime, don't simply annoy voters, though they very much [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=548.1400000000001s)]
*  These two issues threaten the existence of our society. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=549.22s)]
*  So maybe you should run on them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=553.22s)]
*  That seems reasonable, but that's not what they're doing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=555.26s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=557.26s)]
*  Here, for example, is a recent campaign ad from Dr. Oz. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=558.26s)]
*  He's the guy who's losing to the stroke victim in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=561.62s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=563.62s)]
*  I thought I'd do some grocery shopping. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=564.62s)]
*  I'm at Wagner's and my wife wants some vegetables for crudite, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=565.62s)]
*  So here's a broccoli. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=570.26s)]
*  That's two bucks, about a ton of broccoli there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=572.62s)]
*  Here's some asparagus. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=575.5s)]
*  That's four dollars. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=576.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=577.5s)]
*  Carrots. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=578.5s)]
*  That's four more dollars. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=579.5s)]
*  That's ten dollars of vegetables there. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=581.5s)]
*  And then we need some guacamole. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=583.54s)]
*  That's four dollars more. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=586.46s)]
*  And she loves salsa. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=588.7s)]
*  Yeah, salsa there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=589.98s)]
*  Six dollars must be as short as her salsa. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=591.34s)]
*  Guys, that's twenty dollars for crudite. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=594.34s)]
*  This doesn't include the tequila. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=596.9s)]
*  I mean, that's outrageous. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=597.9s)]
*  We got Joe Biden to thank for this. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=600.54s)]
*  Twenty dollars for crudite. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=604.1s)]
*  Whatever that is. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=606.1s)]
*  It's obviously very easy to make fun of that, but it's not entirely a stupid ad if inflation [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=607.1s)]
*  were the salient issue here, the generational issue of this campaign season. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=616.9s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=623.54s)]
*  Inflation is terrible. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  It's making people poorer. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=626.54s)]
*  We actually could tank the U.S. dollar. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=627.54s)]
*  These are all big, big problems. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=629.6999999999999s)]
*  But changing the population of the United States, allowing people to be murdered in [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=632.34s)]
*  the street, letting drug addicts live on the sidewalk and sending them crack pipes, that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=636.4599999999999s)]
*  will change everything forever. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=641.54s)]
*  These are offenses against the most basic rules of any civilization. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=643.7s)]
*  And the most basic of all is you reward people for doing the right thing and you penalize [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=649.1400000000001s)]
*  them for doing the wrong thing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=653.82s)]
*  If you start doing the opposite, then everything falls apart. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=655.3000000000001s)]
*  And everybody knows that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=657.46s)]
*  So why don't you say it? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=658.46s)]
*  Why don't you say that? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=659.94s)]
*  Don't be embarrassed. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=661.1400000000001s)]
*  Just say that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=662.34s)]
*  If you live in Texas, for example, a supposedly conservative state, you don't even have police [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=664.6600000000001s)]
*  protection anymore. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=670.58s)]
*  That's how quickly things have changed on the most basic level. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=672.7s)]
*  That's not some report from a government agency telling you what the inflation rate is. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=676.7800000000001s)]
*  That's your life. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=681.26s)]
*  You don't have police protection anymore. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=682.48s)]
*  If there's one reason to run for office, it's to fix things like that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=684.9000000000001s)]
*  Here's Fox reporter Madison Alworth describing it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=688.94s)]
*  In Dallas, they are unable to fill the nearly 600 openings that they have budgeted for. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=692.1400000000001s)]
*  In Atlanta, they have over 400 openings that they cannot fill, even with an up to $4,000 [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=697.26s)]
*  signing bonus. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=702.5s)]
*  Police department has been demonized across the country, in communities across the country [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=704.02s)]
*  from coast to coast. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=707.56s)]
*  It's been demonized. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=708.72s)]
*  If that police officer in uniform is not on your corner, we're seeing the results. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=710.08s)]
*  The staffing crisis is creating crime. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=714.44s)]
*  It's creating violence. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=716.86s)]
*  You take a look at crime across the U.S. and it is way up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=718.22s)]
*  Robbery is up nearly 20% in Chicago and Los Angeles, and here in New York City, up nearly [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=721.7s)]
*  40%. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=727.14s)]
*  Okay, crudités, 20 bucks, got it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=730.1s)]
*  But that, that's more important than everything else that's going on right now. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=735.3s)]
*  Law and order. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=741.74s)]
*  You see it on the streets of our cities. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=743.26s)]
*  You see it at our southern border. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=744.84s)]
*  It's collapsed. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=746.14s)]
*  So if you're a Republican voter, and not just a Republican voter, any voter, you probably [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=748.22s)]
*  want to know what is the government going to do about the fact that I can call 911 [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=753.46s)]
*  and no one shows up? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=760.5s)]
*  What are you going to do about the fact that our border is open to the world and that millions [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=763.22s)]
*  of them have come in illegally? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=768.22s)]
*  How can you take the country seriously when it doesn't even have a border? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=770.86s)]
*  And it doesn't. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=775.26s)]
*  And we know that because on video every single day, people stream in. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=776.26s)]
*  Fox's Bill Mollutian just caught the whole thing once again on camera. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=782.06s)]
*  Take a look at this video we shot yesterday where we're standing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=785.06s)]
*  This is the first time we had ever seen this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=788.66s)]
*  The Texas National Guard closed and locked a gate on this property. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=791.06s)]
*  It's a major crossing area and they blocked the illegal immigrants from being able to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=795.16s)]
*  come into this property. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=799.5s)]
*  It's private property. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  The owner allows the National Guard and Border Patrol to work here, but you can see illegal [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  immigrants started showing up. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=806.2199999999999s)]
*  They weren't let in. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=807.68s)]
*  They expected to be let in and they were surprised they couldn't get in. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=808.68s)]
*  Here's what happened though. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=811.98s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=812.98s)]
*  Border Patrol showed up. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=814.5s)]
*  A supervisor came with a key, opened up that gate and let all of those illegal immigrants [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=815.5s)]
*  in, symbolic of the way the state of Texas handles things versus the way the federal [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  government handles things. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=824.38s)]
*  So if every Republican candidate is repeated, repeat after me, law enforcement, law and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=827.4200000000001s)]
*  order is not racist. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=833.46s)]
*  Law and order is a prerequisite for civilization. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=835.7800000000001s)]
*  And if it goes away, so does the country. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=839.34s)]
*  You would win the votes not simply of your own voters, but of a lot of other voters and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=842.4200000000001s)]
*  people who have never voted before. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=848.1s)]
*  And any normal Democrat would agree with that because it's inherently true. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=849.86s)]
*  But it's the opposite of what we have. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=853.1s)]
*  When Ann Coulter saw the video we just played, she noted correctly that it's easier to get [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=855.22s)]
*  into this country as an illegal alien than it is to return as an American citizen back [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=860.58s)]
*  into JFK. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=864.2800000000001s)]
*  By the way, the people you saw are the ones who just want to be caught. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=866.28s)]
*  They're turning themselves in so they can get bussed to your town. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=870.52s)]
*  There are a lot of people who don't want to be caught and those people are bringing in [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=872.92s)]
*  fentanyl which is killing thousands of Americans every month. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  It's been a busy few weeks for US Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=880.56s)]
*  At the checkpoint on Saturday, they found 2.5 pounds of black tar heroin, 9 pounds of [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=884.9s)]
*  heroin, 89 pounds of meth and 320,000 fentanyl pills. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=890.36s)]
*  Later that day, another huge bust including more than 40 pounds of drugs and 150,000 fentanyl [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=895.76s)]
*  pills hidden in a car. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=901.32s)]
*  Border officials say people are becoming more creative in the ways they smuggle items through. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=902.94s)]
*  In one case, someone tried to hide 10,000 fentanyl pills using a body shaping garment. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=907.2s)]
*  Everybody knows this is happening. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=914.5s)]
*  This is not hidden information. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=916.16s)]
*  These are not the Gnostic Gospels. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=917.16s)]
*  Every American citizen knows exactly what's happening. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=919.72s)]
*  And yet the leaders of the Republican Party, Mitch McConnell, will watch footage like that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  until you know the most important issue that we face, territorial integrity of Ukraine. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=927.24s)]
*  And then the same breath which says there's nothing the Republican Party can do to avert [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=931.32s)]
*  historic humiliation in the midterm elections. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=935.58s)]
*  But the truth, as you well know, is that the people who run the Republican Party don't [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=938.48s)]
*  actually want to do anything about it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=942.96s)]
*  There are candidates who are talking about this stuff, JD Vance in Ohio, Blake Masters [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=944.24s)]
*  in Arizona, Joe Kent in the Pacific Northwest. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=948.2s)]
*  The leaders of the Republican Party in Washington would rather those guys lose and people like [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  them lose than change the focus of the party to issues that voters actually care about. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=956.0s)]
*  But the truth is you can't win elections unless you listen to voters. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=962.84s)]
*  They're telling you what they want. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=965.36s)]
*  Republicans have less than three months to figure this very simple riddle out or it's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=968.0400000000001s)]
*  going to be an actual disaster. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EawyrgeHTfM&t=972.48s)]
