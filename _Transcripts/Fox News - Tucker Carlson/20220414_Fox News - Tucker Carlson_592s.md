# Tucker: Elon Musk is putting everything on the line
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk became famous as a businessman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=3.56s)]
*  He makes electric cars and rockets and has become the single richest person on planet [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=7.96s)]
*  Earth by doing that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=12.4s)]
*  Elon Musk is not from the United States, he grew up in South Africa and yet he has a keen [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=13.84s)]
*  and precise understanding of how our system was designed to work. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  As he put it on Twitter last month, quote, free speech is essential to a functioning [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=22.92s)]
*  democracy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=27.52s)]
*  And then Musk asked his 80 million followers on Twitter a very simple question, quote, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=29.48s)]
*  do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to that principle? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=33.24s)]
*  And overwhelmingly they answered, no, it doesn't. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  So Elon Musk understands something about Twitter that many people in our country don't understand, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=39.52s)]
*  which is it is the single most important forum for speech possibly in the world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=43.84s)]
*  Not because it's the biggest, but because it's where elite opinion is incubated. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=49.16s)]
*  And so free speech on Twitter matters. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  In last month, Elon Musk gave the impression that he planned to do something about it, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=56.92s)]
*  that he planned to open up Twitter. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=61.64s)]
*  He bought 10% of the company. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Now today, Musk has just put in an offer to buy 100% of Twitter at $54 a share and take [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  the company private. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=72.68s)]
*  Now from a business perspective, this is a very tempting offer for the company. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  In fact, his offer represents a 54% premium over the company's share price the day before [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=79.68s)]
*  he began investing in it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=84.6s)]
*  He wrote a letter to Twitter's board last night, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=86.56s)]
*  Twitter has extraordinary potential, he wrote. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=88.68s)]
*  I will unlock it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=91.0s)]
*  So this is more than a business play. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it's not an overstatement to say it could be the single most important development [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=95.44s)]
*  for free speech in the modern history of the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  As Musk put it, Twitter's potential is to be, quote, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  the platform for free speech around the globe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=106.28s)]
*  Twitter will, quote, neither thrive nor serve the societal imperative in its current form. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=110.16s)]
*  Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=114.8s)]
*  Musk then made it clear that he has no confidence whatsoever in the people who currently run [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=119.28s)]
*  Twitter, including its pro-censorship CEO. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=122.56s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=124.92s)]
*  If this deal doesn't work, given that I have no confidence in management or do I believe [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=125.92s)]
*  I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=130.32s)]
*  as a shareholder. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=134.76s)]
*  That means if Twitter's board rejects Elon Musk's offer, they will need to explain why [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=136.74s)]
*  to their shareholders they turned down a deal that would make the shareholders much [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=141.28s)]
*  richer. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=146.04s)]
*  So by doing this, Elon Musk is putting everything on the line. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=147.56s)]
*  He knows how important Twitter is to the people who run our system, who run the global system. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=152.12s)]
*  For them, censorship and propaganda are not a feature of their rule. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=157.16s)]
*  Their rule depends on censorship and propaganda. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=161.56s)]
*  If you are offering policies that really benefit nobody but yourself, you have to lie about [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=165.16s)]
*  them and you must prevent anyone from complaining about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  So censorship and propaganda are at the very heart of neoliberalism. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  And Elon Musk is challenging all of that directly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  He's the richest man in the world. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=183.04s)]
*  He's not trying to make more money. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=184.04s)]
*  He's not donating to a foreign charity or creating a tax shelter for himself, at least [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=185.04s)]
*  in this case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  He's using his money to allow at least potentially Americans to speak freely. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=189.56s)]
*  Is it distressing that our own democratic system isn't working, that you would need [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=195.54s)]
*  some rich guy to swoop in, Deus ex machina, to save free speech in the United States? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=198.76s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Is it sad that we're all desperate for Elon Musk to save us? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=204.78s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=207.88s)]
*  But who else is going to save us? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  Nobody at this point. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  So of course, corporate media, which exists to stifle the views of individual Americans, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=213.28s)]
*  hates the idea. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=218.04s)]
*  And their first move is to mock it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=219.28s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=221.48s)]
*  He says he wants to pay $54.20 a share to buy up the rest of Twitter that he doesn't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=222.84s)]
*  Of course, $54.20. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=228.56s)]
*  That's $4.20. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=230.28s)]
*  That's a code for marijuana, which he very much enjoys. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=231.28s)]
*  So is this all a troll or is this very real? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=235.02s)]
*  She's so bizarre. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=237.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=238.4s)]
*  I mean, the $4.20 code and everything. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=239.4s)]
*  Is it just a troll? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=240.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=241.4s)]
*  If he's not going to negotiate, he says, this is my best and final, last and final [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=242.4s)]
*  offer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to negotiate here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  Is this just some sort of game? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  Is he doing it for the lulz? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=249.56s)]
*  It can't really be real. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=253.12s)]
*  Well, think it through for a second. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=255.32s)]
*  By challenging the monopoly on speech, not just the United States, but globally on Twitter, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=257.76s)]
*  on this central platform for ideas, Elon Musk is risking everything that he has. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=264.32s)]
*  His many businesses intersect with governments around the world. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=270.36s)]
*  They're not for this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=273.32s)]
*  They could crush him for even suggesting it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=274.56s)]
*  So he's all in. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=277.48s)]
*  He has to be all in even to say something like this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=278.48s)]
*  At Twitter, they know he's all in and that's why they're so upset about it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=282.44s)]
*  According to a Broomberg reporter, even before Musk's offer today of a hostile takeover, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=286.16s)]
*  the vibe among workers at Twitter is, quote, super stressed with employees, quote, working [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=292.0s)]
*  together to help each other get through the week. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=296.66s)]
*  That's how threatening this is. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  And you have to ask yourself, what kind of company is Twitter? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=302.56s)]
*  The company's stock just jumped 30%. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=305.92s)]
*  That happened when Elon Musk first bought in. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  So obviously, this is not a company that exists to make money. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a company that exists to censor speech. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=314.28s)]
*  That's its whole purpose. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=317.55999999999995s)]
*  The Biden administration certainly understands this, and they've already made a move to intimidate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Musk into backing off. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Fox Business' Charlie Gasparino is reporting tonight that, quote, as Elon Musk offers to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=326.52s)]
*  buy the rest of Twitter, a legal source tells Fox Business that the SEC and the DOJ have [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=330.26s)]
*  launched what he described as a joint investigation into a myriad of Musk regulatory issues, primarily [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  involving Tesla. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=342.1s)]
*  In other words, threaten to allow people to speak freely and will crush your businesses. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=343.1s)]
*  That's third world behavior. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=350.3s)]
*  At the Washington Post, owned by also one of the richest people in the world, Max Boot [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=352.14000000000004s)]
*  very much supports stopping Elon Musk. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=356.18s)]
*  In fact, Elon Musk, he tells us, must be silenced in the name of democracy, quote, I am frightened [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  by the impact on society and politics if Elon Musk acquires Twitter. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=365.62s)]
*  He seems to believe that on social media, anything goes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=369.84s)]
*  For democracy to survive, we need more content moderation, not less. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=379.4s)]
*  So for democracy to survive, the citizens in the democracy need to talk less, need to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=380.88s)]
*  express their opinions more guardedly, need to shut up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=386.0s)]
*  What kind of democracy are we talking about? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  It's not democracy, as the Athenians or the founders of this country understood it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=393.0s)]
*  Democracy is a euphemism for letting our mafia run your country for our benefit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=397.52s)]
*  A journalism professor called Jeff Jarvis explained today on Twitter that tyranny is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  when the regime can't censor its own citizens. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=409.56s)]
*  Quote, today on Twitter feels like the last evening in a Berlin nightclub at the twilight [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=413.0s)]
*  of the Weimar Germany. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  In other words, you're a Nazi if you're for speaking freely on Twitter. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  CNBC host Joe Kernan understands exactly what's going on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=425.72s)]
*  If Twitter is opened up, that means people who are paid to censor the public on Twitter [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  will lose their ability. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  They'll lose their guardianship of free speech. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  Who's that ADL guy, Andrew? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  This is his worst nightmare, I think. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=444.72s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=446.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=447.92s)]
*  It's going to be. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=448.92s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=449.92s)]
*  I mean, if he owns the whole place, it's going to be like, go for it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=450.92s)]
*  I think it's going to be, and the orange man probably going to be back. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=454.32s)]
*  And this is unbelievable. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=458.32s)]
*  He's exactly right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=463.24s)]
*  Again, you can't overstate what a threat this is, not simply to the people occupying [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=464.24s)]
*  seats of political power, but to the whole nonprofit universe that exists and thrives [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=469.74s)]
*  and becomes rich, supporting them through censorship and propaganda. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  So a group like the ADL or Media Matters take money in order to censor people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=480.46s)]
*  They issue some report calling you a racist, and then social media shuts you down. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=485.06s)]
*  Elon Musk is saying, no, people should be able to speak freely. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=490.38s)]
*  That would mean the end of their control over speech, groups like the ADL and Media Matters. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=493.64s)]
*  So the media and these nonprofit groups have to stop this before it happens. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=499.9s)]
*  Here's MSNBC telling you that Elon Musk must be stopped because he's a bigot. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=504.94s)]
*  He's one of the most thin-skinned people on social media, and this week he tried to come [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=509.62s)]
*  for Senator Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted, let's change the rig tax code so that the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=513.92s)]
*  person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=518.9s)]
*  Well, Elon wasn't happy, so he did what he always did and stomped his little feet and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=523.06s)]
*  insulted Senator Warren, calling her an angry mom and referring to her as Senator Karen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=527.06s)]
*  So for so many reasons, being a freeloader and a selfish and disrespectful one, and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=533.24s)]
*  for misappropriating black vernacular for misogynistic purposes, Elon Musk is the absolute worst. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=537.48s)]
*  So all of a sudden, the political party that's supported almost exclusively by oligarchs [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=542.52s)]
*  like Jeff Bezos and the Google guys is telling you that it's dangerous for rich people to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=551.44s)]
*  have too much control over speech. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=557.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=559.92s)]
*  Facebook is controlled by one person, Mark Zuckerberg, but that's not a threat because [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=561.16s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg is happy to work on behalf of the Democratic Party. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=565.02s)]
*  Once again, if anything, we are understating what a big deal this move on Twitter by Elon [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=568.88s)]
*  Musk is. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=574.36s)]
*  If free speech is restored to even one big social media platform, it all comes tumbling [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=575.36s)]
*  down. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrFsNcskAY&t=580.9599999999999s)]
