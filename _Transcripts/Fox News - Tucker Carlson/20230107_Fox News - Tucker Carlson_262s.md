# 'I feel sorry' for Prince Harry: Father Calvin Robinson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw)
*  Well, it looks like Prince Harry and that woman from LA that he married are running [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=0.0s)]
*  out of money. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=7.92s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=8.92s)]
*  Because they're still talking about themselves, selling the most boring little details from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=9.92s)]
*  their boring little lives for more money. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=14.68s)]
*  So to that end, Prince Harry has just resorted to telling us even more about a dramatic physical [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=18.52s)]
*  altercation he had with his brother, which wasn't actually that dramatic. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=24.84s)]
*  He sat down the water, called me another name and then came at me, he says in his new book. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  But for some reason, a lot of media outlets in this country are deeply invested in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=34.2s)]
*  details of this boring man's boring life. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=38.32s)]
*  Here's Good Morning America, for example. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=40.84s)]
*  The quote in this book where you refer to your brother as your beloved brother and arch-nemesis. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Strong words. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=51.4s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=52.4s)]
*  There has always been this competition between us, weirdly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=55.24s)]
*  I think it really plays into, always played by the airspur. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=61.52s)]
*  Oh, so two brothers who had tension between them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=65.64s)]
*  Breaking news on Good Morning America. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=70.88s)]
*  But if you're from Great Britain and these are the people who are supposedly technically [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=73.68s)]
*  the head of state of your country, what do you make of all of this, this embarrassing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=79.58s)]
*  spectacle? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=83.48s)]
*  Well, I thought it was time to check in with Father Calvin Robinson, who's an Anglican [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  deacon from that country, joins us tonight to assess. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=87.4s)]
*  Father, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=90.2s)]
*  I mean, how is this going over in your country? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Ah, Tucker, first of all, Happy New Year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=96.48s)]
*  How is it going over? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  I think we're all sick and tired of Harry and Meghan whining and moaning and going on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  and on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, most of us are anyway. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, at first when I first saw these headlines, I thought, OK, this is annoying, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  this is frustrating. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  They're being disparaging about the monarchy again, which of course is family to them, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  but to us it's an institution at the very fabric of our nation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=117.16s)]
*  But I'm past frustration. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=120.48s)]
*  I actually feel sorry for Harry now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=121.48s)]
*  He's using really juvenile language. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=123.64s)]
*  He seems quite immature, to be honest. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=126.84s)]
*  I don't know any other grown man that talks about their private parts as their todger. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, he talks about mounting a woman. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=132.68s)]
*  And it's the kind of conversation I expect to hear in a primary school. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=135.68s)]
*  Just in that clip you just showed, he talks about his brother as his arch nemesis. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=139.12s)]
*  How many adults have an arch nemesis? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=142.88s)]
*  He seems to live in a fantasy world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=146.16s)]
*  In the excerpts we saw that Meghan was singing to seals and Harry said, she's magical because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  the seals sang back. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=154.32s)]
*  These people are delusional. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=155.84s)]
*  This is not good. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=157.72s)]
*  They need to seek help. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=158.72s)]
*  They need to stop talking to the press, stop airing their dirty laundry and actually get [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=159.72s)]
*  some professional medical help. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=163.24s)]
*  I wonder, I mean, you're obviously a man of the cloth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=166.68s)]
*  What does it do to your soul if you never stop talking about yourself? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=171.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=175.68s)]
*  It's the inner narcissism. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=176.68s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  It eats away at you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  It's not just talking about yourself. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  It's the fact that they don't seem to take any agency for themselves either. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  There's no personal responsibility. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, in a few of these excerpts we've seen that Harry says, oh, actually it was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=186.84s)]
*  Will and Kate who made me wear that Nazi uniform. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  And you're thinking, again, you're a grown adult. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=192.72s)]
*  You don't have to wear a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party if you don't find it funny. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  You clearly chose to do so. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=199.12s)]
*  You can blame everyone else. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  And the same, you know, he goes on to say that he had this altercation with his brother. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  And this is a trained army serviceman who's saying, I had a fight with my brother. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  I had to go seek therapy for that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=211.56s)]
*  It's like, first of all, you are a killer. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=213.0s)]
*  You're talking about how many people you've killed in service, which of course is uncouth. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  No one talks about how many people they killed in service. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=220.72s)]
*  But then on the other hand of the argument, you're saying, oh, I had an argument with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  my brother and I had to go and get therapy about this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=226.76s)]
*  None of it seems to add up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=230.04s)]
*  It's not balanced. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=231.04s)]
*  He does need prayer. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=232.04s)]
*  I think he needs all of our prayer. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=233.04s)]
*  They both do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=234.04s)]
*  And they need something more professional too. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=235.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=237.76s)]
*  I mean, no, I think, and you make a fair point that no one can make you wear a Nazi uniform [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=238.76s)]
*  to a dinner party. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=243.0s)]
*  You did that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=244.32s)]
*  It's a real one. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=245.32s)]
*  Father Calvin Robinson of the United Kingdom, thank you so much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=247.32s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-15V7GKECw&t=251.68s)]
