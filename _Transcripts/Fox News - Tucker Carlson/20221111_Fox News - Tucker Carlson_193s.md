# We have an obligation to keep our people safe; Pedro Gonzalez
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE)
*  and joins us tonight. Hey Pedro, thanks for coming on. How do you interpret this? I know it's only a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=0.0s)]
*  few days ago, but what do you make of it? Well Tucker, Latinos are not a monolith. Cubans in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=4.64s)]
*  Florida don't think and vote the same way as Mexicans in California. What we can say is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=10.4s)]
*  Republicans improved in some places, but Democrats seem to still maintain a hold over majority Latino [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=15.52s)]
*  support across the country. But these people are persuadable. They can be moved. But what was the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  GOP's ground game ahead of midterms? I think it's important to reflect on this. Democrats do outreach [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=27.84s)]
*  in key places. They spend millions rewriting voting rules and regulations in their favor. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=33.68s)]
*  The priority on the other hand of the political machine around Kevin McCarthy was to target [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=39.28s)]
*  America first candidates like Joe Kent in Washington and Anthony Sabatini in Florida [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  because they reviewed his threats to his power. What was the GOP's vision, its promise to Americans? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy said entitlement reform, in other words cuts to social security and Medicare, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=56.64s)]
*  would be a top GOP priority after midterms and also of course getting another 50 billion dollars [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=61.44s)]
*  for Ukraine by January. So we cut grandma's social security check and we mail it to Zelensky, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=67.6s)]
*  It's not hard to see why Republicans were underwhelming not just with Latinos but other [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=76.32s)]
*  persuadable voters when you have this kind of leadership. But this is also, Tucker, why I'm not [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=82.32s)]
*  pessimistic because when you have Washington generals like this running the party you can't [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=88.08s)]
*  really say that we've begun to fight. Well I think that's exactly right. So if you were going to make [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=93.44s)]
*  the, this is a long conversation, I hope you come back for another hour, but if you could like distill [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  the message that works not just to Latino voters but just to working-class voters, what would it be? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  That America is not a bizarre, it's not an open-air marketplace for the world to plunder. It's a home [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=107.04s)]
*  to a real people. It's a home that we, excuse me, sorry, that it's a home to a real flesh and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  blood people and that means that we have an obligation to keep our communities safe. We have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  an obligation to secure our border. We have an obligation to not just post memes about how [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=131.44s)]
*  Biden and the Democrats have failed on crime but to actually do something, propose solutions instead [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=136.72s)]
*  of just adopting the Democratic Party's policies on crime and then just reframing them as somehow [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=141.52s)]
*  fiscally conservative or America first, which is what the GOP has done historically. How about being [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=147.28s)]
*  an anti-war party or in this case anti-nuclear war? The reason that the GOP couldn't talk about this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=152.48s)]
*  of course is because the party leadership actually is pro-war but the thing about the war in Ukraine [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=158.48s)]
*  is that you can connect it to everything from the cost of fuel in your car to the rising cost [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=164.08s)]
*  of food on your table but again Republicans are frankly cowards and we're not willing to take on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  this issue. I think you're exactly over the target so to speak. Pedro Gonzalez, great to see you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BG4mJdOlE&t=174.64000000000001s)]
