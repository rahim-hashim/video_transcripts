# They are ‘enabling’ drug usage: Former addict
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng)
*  Gina McDonald knows a lot about this subject. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=0.0s)]
*  She's a recovering addict. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=2.1s)]
*  She was prescribed opioids after surgery [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=3.1s)]
*  and got addicted like so many other people have. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=4.96s)]
*  She's now the co-founder of Mothers Against Drug Deaths. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=6.98s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=9.36s)]
*  Gina, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  So you've seen every part of this epidemic, too much of it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of these ads? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=16.66s)]
*  Yes, too much of it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=19.26s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Tucker. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=20.22s)]
*  When I first saw these ads, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=22.3s)]
*  I thought to use the word empowerment to me was ridiculous. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=23.72s)]
*  First of all, my drug addiction robbed me of my dignity, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=28.7s)]
*  my health, my kids, my sanity. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=33.46s)]
*  There was no empowerment in my drug addiction. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=35.98s)]
*  And whether I used with a friend [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=39.14s)]
*  or whether I used a clean pipe, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  it still took me to the depths of hell. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=43.78s)]
*  So I don't understand how we're encouraging. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=45.54s)]
*  It sounds like, very much sounds like encouraging [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=48.94s)]
*  and empowering people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=51.84s)]
*  And in the very bottom, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=53.32s)]
*  and if you notice in the very bottom left-hand corner, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=54.36s)]
*  an afterthought is here's how you get help. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=57.22s)]
*  And I don't understand why they don't lead with that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=60.62s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the opposite. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=65.02s)]
*  I mean, addiction is the most degrading thing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=66.9s)]
*  that can happen to a person. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=69.58s)]
*  Most people who've been addicted to something [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=70.84s)]
*  will tell you they'd rather have cancer than an addiction. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=72.14s)]
*  So to have the authorities encouraging addiction, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=74.74s)]
*  I mean, what does this mean? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=76.98s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=79.06s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=79.9s)]
*  You know, I'm digging into that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=81.78s)]
*  And to me, it seems, I mean, people get paid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  It's a big industry. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=87.32s)]
*  Right, well, that's right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  You know, very big industry, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=89.56s)]
*  the addiction and treatment, treatment, you know. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=91.52s)]
*  But we have the same thing in San Francisco. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=95.52s)]
*  We've had posters like this and ads like this up for a while, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=97.36s)]
*  the know your overdose, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=101.36s)]
*  Muse with friends. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=103.32s)]
*  And the pictures they show [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=104.24s)]
*  are look like people partying and having a good time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it's enabling. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=109.36s)]
*  And they put these posters up and they hand people foil [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=113.08s)]
*  and they hand people straws and they hand people pipes [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=117.0s)]
*  and say, we're meeting them where they're at, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=119.84s)]
*  but they're leaving them in there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=122.0s)]
*  It's not compassionate to leave someone on the street. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=125.84s)]
*  If you gave this advice to your own children [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=128.8s)]
*  and help them use narcotics, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=131.68s)]
*  you would have them taken away by family services, correct? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=133.88s)]
*  Absolutely, that's what happened to me, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=137.96s)]
*  I mean, I was in the middle of a meth induced psychosis [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=140.88s)]
*  on the street and the police picked me up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=144.84s)]
*  I lost my kids, I lost everything. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=148.16s)]
*  They took me to a mental facility [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=149.84s)]
*  and they said, you can go in here or you can go to jail. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=152.6s)]
*  And we just aren't doing that anymore. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=155.6s)]
*  We need to do more of that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=157.2s)]
*  I think you're exactly, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  if you really wanted to save people's lives [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  and empower them and actually empower them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=162.84s)]
*  and return them their dignity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Gina McDonald, I appreciate your perspective [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=166.08s)]
*  and your bravery in saying so, thank you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tucker. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=170.2s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVZAvGKqng&t=172.24s)]
