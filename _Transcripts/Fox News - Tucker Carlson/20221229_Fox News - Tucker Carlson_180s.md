# Biden has $1.7T spending bill flown to Virgin Islands vacation home
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s)
*  Joe Biden, he's still on vacation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=0.0s)]
*  So he just had that massive spending bill [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=2.64s)]
*  flown to the Virgin Islands on a passenger jet [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=5.08s)]
*  so that he could sign it into law. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=8.56s)]
*  Now, thousands of Americans are trapped in airports tonight, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=10.52s)]
*  but somehow this particular jet took off with no problems. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=14.44s)]
*  The 4,000 page, $1.7 trillion spending bill is now law. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=18.28s)]
*  Now, Chris Bedford is executive editor [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=24.8s)]
*  at the Common Sense Society. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=26.92s)]
*  He joins us now to assess. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=29.68s)]
*  Bit of a double standard here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=32.64s)]
*  My first thought, Chris, was why did he leave Washington [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  in the first place knowing that his signature [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  was going to be needed very imminently? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  Because why not? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=45.74s)]
*  I mean, why not send a private jet down to St. Croix [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=46.88s)]
*  to bring him the bill to sign it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Why not leave Washington, D.C.? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=50.86s)]
*  Why care at all about all the people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  who are stuck in airports? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=54.2s)]
*  I mean, this entire bill is completely representative [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=55.6s)]
*  of how little D.C. cares about actual American interests, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=57.98s)]
*  about the American people, about their voters. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=61.58s)]
*  I mean, if you're a Republican, for example, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=64.1s)]
*  decided to stay home during the November election, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=65.86s)]
*  what better vindication do you have for that decision [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=69.7s)]
*  than this bill that Mitch McConnell pushed through [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=72.3s)]
*  with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=74.22s)]
*  at the end? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=76.9s)]
*  The absolute arrogance [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=77.74s)]
*  and where they're actually putting the priorities here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=78.66s)]
*  Now, for example, there's over $13 billion in this bill [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=82.06s)]
*  going to fix the Ukrainian energy grid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  Now, there's about 1 13th or 1 10th that amount or less [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=87.2s)]
*  going to Puerto Rico. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=90.84s)]
*  Puerto Rico is a famously corrupt energy grid [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=92.12s)]
*  where a lot of that money is siphoned off, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=94.62s)]
*  nothing works and hurricanes hit it, it's a disaster. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  But at least that's part of the United States. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=98.44s)]
*  Ukraine is where that money's going instead. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=100.68s)]
*  There are so many pet projects. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=102.66s)]
*  There's over $80 million going to save the grouse, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=104.2s)]
*  which is a beautiful bird that's being destroyed right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=107.18s)]
*  Their habitat's being destroyed by windmills [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=110.4s)]
*  and solar panels, which get billions and billions [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=112.16s)]
*  and billions of dollars in their own profit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=114.4s)]
*  So at that point, when there's so little caring, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=116.56s)]
*  when after an election, DC politicians are so arrogant, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you might as well just put that 4,000 page bill [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=121.56s)]
*  onto a private jet, fly it down to St. Croix [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=124.24s)]
*  and sign it while you're on vacation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=126.52s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, so there's so too many examples of, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=129.98s)]
*  the pork, the special projects, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=133.62s)]
*  the fluff that was shoved into that bill. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=136.12s)]
*  But I think one of the most egregious ones that I saw [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=137.82s)]
*  has to do with the crisis that's happening at the border, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=140.8s)]
*  where they allotted money to go towards customs [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=143.5s)]
*  and border protection, but they went out of their way [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=146.08s)]
*  to put language in that bill that says, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=148.52s)]
*  you're not actually allowed to use any of this money [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=150.84s)]
*  towards technologies and capabilities [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=153.36s)]
*  that will actually help secure the border, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  which is just, I mean, it is so offensive [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  and wrong on so many levels. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for bringing some sense [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=162.68s)]
*  to this insane situation, Chris, I appreciate it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojsg7qbBt_s&t=164.52s)]
