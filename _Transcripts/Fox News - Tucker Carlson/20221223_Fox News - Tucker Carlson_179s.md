# Woman who runs Libs of TikTok to reveal her identity on 'Tucker Carlson Today'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M)
*  The good news about the collapse of the traditional legacy media is that new media is moving to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=0.0s)]
*  fill the void they left behind. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=8.28s)]
*  And Libs of TikTok is honestly, well it's a Twitter account, but it's become one of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=10.52s)]
*  the most important sites of reporting in the new media. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=15.6s)]
*  And essentially what Libs of TikTok does is find videos that people have posted online [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=20.68s)]
*  about themselves publicly and hold them up for a bigger audience. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=25.8s)]
*  Libs of TikTok is one of the reasons we know what's happening in classrooms around the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=29.88s)]
*  country right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=32.8s)]
*  Here's a sample. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=34.04s)]
*  I have had multiple students come out to me, not just with their sexuality, but also with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=35.04s)]
*  their gender identity. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=40.56s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I think it's so important to be out and loud and proud. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=42.32s)]
*  I teach my elementary school students about gender identity. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=46.4s)]
*  Some people are girls, some are boys, some are both, some are neither. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=49.36s)]
*  I might tell this kid, we do have a flag in the class that you can pledge your allegiance [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=52.2s)]
*  to. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=58.04s)]
*  And he looks around and he goes, oh, that one? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=59.04s)]
*  So there's something really wrong in the country and in our classrooms. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=66.36s)]
*  Kids are being exposed to this without the knowledge of their parents. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=71.68s)]
*  And we wouldn't even know that were it not in a lot of cases for the reporting of Libs [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=74.36s)]
*  of TikTok, who by the way doesn't editorialize much, just holds up what people have said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=78.48s)]
*  about themselves. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=82.48s)]
*  For doing this, the left has really tried to hurt the person who runs Libs of TikTok. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=84.28s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz of the Washington Post wrote a whole piece trying to find out who this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=88.92s)]
*  person is so other people could harass her. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=94.16s)]
*  Well, the person who runs Libs of TikTok just sat down with us and for the first time revealed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  her identity. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=102.24s)]
*  For a new episode of Tucker Carlson today, here's part of it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=103.24s)]
*  People ask me all the time, this is one of the most common questions, is if you could [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  say one thing to Taylor, what would it be? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=111.24s)]
*  Or if you can ask her one question. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=113.88s)]
*  And I thought about this so much and I always I wasn't I was never sure how to answer the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=116.0s)]
*  question and I thought about it a lot. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=120.56s)]
*  And then I realized the answer is I don't want to talk to her. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=122.72s)]
*  She's a bad person and she's toxic. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=126.84s)]
*  And I don't want to we agree. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=129.88s)]
*  We disagree. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=132.2s)]
*  Sorry, we disagree on everything. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=133.2s)]
*  There's we have nothing in common. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=136.52s)]
*  She she's not a person I ever want to be in the same room with. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=138.64s)]
*  I never want to be in her presence. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=142.68s)]
*  So there's my answer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=144.88s)]
*  I don't want to talk to her. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=146.12s)]
*  So on Tuesday, we're going to take that off her face and you will see for the first time [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=149.52s)]
*  who runs Libs of TikTok, she will be public and we think a force in American media. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=154.96s)]
*  That's going to happen Tuesday right here on this show. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=162.0s)]
*  The whole interview drops that day on Fox Nation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=164.24s)]
*  We hope you watch. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwehwtgpm8M&t=166.8s)]
