# Tucker: He is a remarkable actor
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw)
*  Well, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're trying to find things to be happy about. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=3.4s)]
*  And actually, if you look hard enough, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  there are a lot of them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=6.7s)]
*  One of the best things about say, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=8.4s)]
*  a Supreme Court confirmation hearing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=9.88s)]
*  is that you get to see the US Senate in action. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=12.52s)]
*  And this is new. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=15.96s)]
*  If you're like most people, you know, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=16.8s)]
*  the Senate has a hundred members or two from every state [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=17.88s)]
*  and you know that they're somehow important. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=20.6s)]
*  They're in the constitution. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  So they wear dark suits and red ties to work. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=23.84s)]
*  They talk about laws. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=25.96s)]
*  Every summer they fly to foreign countries [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=27.52s)]
*  and act like their president. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=29.28s)]
*  Some of them you may even know by name. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=30.68s)]
*  The famous ones like Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=32.68s)]
*  Obviously the publicity addicts like Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=35.32s)]
*  And of course the ones you see on your own ballot [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=37.96s)]
*  every six years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=40.0s)]
*  So that's what you know. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=40.92s)]
*  But do you really know these people? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=42.28s)]
*  Who are they really? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=44.54s)]
*  What are they like? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=45.96s)]
*  Well, unless you happen to live next door to one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=47.56s)]
*  or you watch an inordinate amount of C-SPAN, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=49.46s)]
*  it's hard to know what they're like. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=52.0s)]
*  And that's why confirmation hearings are so great. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  You get to see US senators in their natural habitat. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=56.68s)]
*  Turns out there are confirmation hearings [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=60.36s)]
*  underway right now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=61.88s)]
*  You may have heard about them [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=62.72s)]
*  for a Biden appointee called Contangi Jackson. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=63.76s)]
*  Now Jackson is a world renowned legal genius [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=67.0s)]
*  who for reasons that are still not clear [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=69.44s)]
*  cannot determine what a woman is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=71.36s)]
*  We told you about her last night. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=73.02s)]
*  But so far the star of these hearings [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=74.88s)]
*  has not been Contangi Jackson. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=76.88s)]
*  It's been a junior senator from New Jersey [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=79.34s)]
*  called Cory Booker. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=81.6s)]
*  Now like Contangi Jackson, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=83.56s)]
*  Cory Booker is also a world famous legal scholar, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=85.24s)]
*  hence his seat on the Judiciary Committee. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=87.92s)]
*  Booker attended not only Stanford and Yale Law School, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  but then went all the way to Oxford University in England [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  on the coveted Rhodes Scholarship. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=95.94s)]
*  He has quite a resume. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=97.86s)]
*  If academic credentials still had any connection [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  to ability or achievement, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  Cory Booker would be a very impressive person. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=103.74s)]
*  But in his case, we're gonna have to grade on a curve [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=106.56s)]
*  because Cory Booker has come a long way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=108.38s)]
*  Cory Booker is from a world you have never been to. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=110.64s)]
*  He's from a hard, unforgiving world of crime, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=113.0s)]
*  decay, and raw urban authenticity. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=115.68s)]
*  Cory Booker is from the streets of Newark. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=118.56s)]
*  He once described his world in an interview, quote, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=121.08s)]
*  "'I still remember my first month on the street,' he said. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=123.48s)]
*  "'I walked up to this charismatic black guy my age [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=126.36s)]
*  "'called T-Bone, who was one of the drug lords. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=128.8s)]
*  "'I said, yo man, what's up?' [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=131.76s)]
*  "'And he leaped up in front of me, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=134.02s)]
*  "'looked me right in the eye and said, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=135.08s)]
*  "'Who the blank do you think you are? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=137.16s)]
*  "'If you ever so much as look at me again, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=138.72s)]
*  "'I'm gonna put a cap in your ass.' [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=140.92s)]
*  Now T-Bone, as you probably concluded, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=143.72s)]
*  was one of Newark's most notorious drug lords. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=145.56s)]
*  As Joe Biden might've said, he was a bad dude. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=148.2s)]
*  But Cory Booker's a bad dude too, in his own way. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=150.92s)]
*  And the two became close, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=153.88s)]
*  the Road Scholar and the Crack Slinger, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=155.4s)]
*  united by a common love of the street. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=157.44s)]
*  But then inevitably, tragedy struck. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=160.48s)]
*  Cory Booker learned that T-Bone was on the lam [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=162.98s)]
*  from the law. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=165.24s)]
*  By this point, Cory Booker was the mayor of Newark, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  so the friendship couldn't last. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=168.76s)]
*  As Booker later recalled with sadness, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=170.56s)]
*  "'That rift between me and T-Bone was inches. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=172.68s)]
*  "'We sat there, but I felt so alienated [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=174.96s)]
*  "'that there was a gulf as wide [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=177.46s)]
*  "'as the Grand Canyon between us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=178.68s)]
*  "'And I could not reach out to save this young man. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=180.72s)]
*  "'And we drove back to a housing project [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=183.28s)]
*  "'called Brick Towers, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=185.08s)]
*  "'and I've never seen him again since that day.'" [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=186.52s)]
*  It's a poignant story. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=190.28s)]
*  But Cory Booker isn't alone. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=191.8s)]
*  No one has seen T-Bone since that day. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=193.36s)]
*  In fact, no one has ever seen T-Bone at any point ever [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=196.12s)]
*  because T-Bone doesn't exist. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=200.12s)]
*  As we later learned, T-Bone is a fictional character. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=202.24s)]
*  Cory Booker made him up entirely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  But Cory Booker didn't stop there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  He also invented his own identity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=208.88s)]
*  It turns out that Cory Booker is not a product [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=211.6s)]
*  of the streets of Newark, not even close. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=213.52s)]
*  He is in fact a blue-eyed rich kid [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=215.6s)]
*  from an all-white suburb. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=217.24s)]
*  His parents were IBM executives. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=218.24s)]
*  Now you can judge, but you have to concede [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  that whatever else he is, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=222.96s)]
*  Cory Booker is a remarkable actor. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=224.36s)]
*  He is the Jussie Smollett of democratic politics, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=227.06s)]
*  a fraud, yes, but a deeply committed one, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=229.68s)]
*  a man who has honed his skills. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=233.4s)]
*  And those skills have been on full display this week [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  as Booker has emoted all over Kantonji Jackson. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  Now Jackson is an oppressed member [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=242.28s)]
*  of the professional class too. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=244.12s)]
*  She went to Harvard and Harvard Law School. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=245.4s)]
*  So the two of them have a lot in common. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  Watch their solidarity. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  Your family and you speak to service, service, service. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  And I'm telling you right now, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=257.56s)]
*  I'm not letting anybody in the Senate steal my joy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=259.96s)]
*  I told you this at the beginning. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=265.2s)]
*  I'm embarrassed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=267.16s)]
*  It happened earlier today. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=269.96s)]
*  I just look at you and I start getting full of emotion. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=271.36s)]
*  You didn't get here because of some dark money groups. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=275.0s)]
*  You got here how every black woman in America [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=280.16s)]
*  who's gotten anywhere has done. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=283.24s)]
*  By being like Ginger Rogers said, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=286.88s)]
*  I did everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards in heels. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=291.44s)]
*  They're gonna accuse you of this and that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=295.16s)]
*  Heck, in honor of your person who shares your birthday, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=296.84s)]
*  you might be called a communist. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=299.72s)]
*  But don't worry, my sister. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=303.04s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=306.04s)]
*  God has got you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=309.76s)]
*  Do we make that up? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=313.4s)]
*  Do we create that? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=314.96s)]
*  That actually happened in the United States. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  Service, service, service. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=318.8s)]
*  That's what we call hard edge striving now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=321.24s)]
*  It's service. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=323.68s)]
*  But the best was at the end. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=325.84s)]
*  Don't worry, my sister. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=328.96s)]
*  They're related? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, apparently they are, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=331.88s)]
*  at least in some hard to define spiritual sense. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  They have definitely seen each other at Whole Foods [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=334.48s)]
*  or on the flight to Edgerton. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=336.76s)]
*  For decades, these two pioneers [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=338.48s)]
*  have followed virtually identical paths. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=340.64s)]
*  Both grew up in white collar families. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=343.24s)]
*  Both went to multiple elite schools. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=344.72s)]
*  Neither one has ever left the tiny world [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=347.04s)]
*  of credential-mongering NPR listeners who run this country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=349.48s)]
*  Now it's been a struggle for both of them, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=353.92s)]
*  but they've made it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=356.36s)]
*  At this point, they're just sick and tired [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=357.68s)]
*  of being sick and tired. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  Cory Booker chokes up thinking about the journey. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  I was in the White House with my Democratic colleagues [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=364.48s)]
*  and again, I'm in my joy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  I can't help it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=368.56s)]
*  And the president's asking her advice, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  who should we nominate and whatever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=371.72s)]
*  And I look at Kamala and we have a knowing glance, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=374.16s)]
*  which we've had for years when she and I used to sit [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=377.8s)]
*  on this end of this committee at times. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  And then I try to get out to the president what it means. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  What it means. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=387.76000000000005s)]
*  And I wanna tell you, when I look at you, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  this is why I get emotional. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  It's hard for me not to look at you and not see my mom, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  not to see my cousins, one of them who had to come here [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=402.28s)]
*  and sit behind you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=406.84s)]
*  She had to have your back. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=408.44s)]
*  I see my ancestors and yours. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=413.52s)]
*  Nobody's gonna steal the joy of that woman in the street [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=417.32s)]
*  or the calls that I'm getting or the texts. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  Nobody's gonna steal that joy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=422.84s)]
*  You have earned this spot. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=426.08s)]
*  You are worthy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  Today you're my star. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=429.76s)]
*  You are my harbinger of hope. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=432.92s)]
*  That's not Jussie Smollett. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=436.28s)]
*  Did you see the footage from the sentencing? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=438.44s)]
*  That's not Jussie Smollett. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=440.64s)]
*  It's exactly Jussie Smollett. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  Now you can say, oh, I'm offended by it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=443.08s)]
*  But you can also acknowledge that's art. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=446.64s)]
*  The best part, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=449.24s)]
*  share a knowing glance as they have for years. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=451.52s)]
*  It's the mutual recognition of the totally fraudulent. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=454.36s)]
*  A faker knows a faker. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh, you're pretending to be someone you're not? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=458.76s)]
*  Me too. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=460.12s)]
*  It's easy to enjoy all this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=463.64s)]
*  Imagine if you worked at say, CNN or MSNBC or NBC News [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  and you had to pretend that that was an authentic scene [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=471.68s)]
*  that meant something, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  that was rooted in some observable physical reality [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=477.24s)]
*  that people who went to Ivy League schools [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=480.24s)]
*  somehow are oppressed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=485.84s)]
*  So you wouldn't want to acknowledge any of that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  You would want to point out that rather than ask [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=491.8s)]
*  a single actual question during the confirmation hearings, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=493.36s)]
*  Cory Booker just slobbered all over the nominee. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=496.92s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to say any of that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=500.44s)]
*  So you'd have to figure out a way to ignore it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=502.48s)]
*  And our media dutifully did. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=504.48s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=506.56s)]
*  Cory Booker had no questions, really. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  He just offered an extraordinary, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=510.44s)]
*  extemporaneous set of remarks. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=512.64s)]
*  That moment has kind of ruled the day [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=514.6s)]
*  after what was really Republicans hijacking [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=517.48s)]
*  so much of this hearing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=520.6s)]
*  What we saw Senator Padilla and Senator Booker do [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  to affirm her is something that is deeply touching in a way [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  because we know how deeply disrespected black women can be. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=528.7600000000001s)]
*  It's bringing tears to my eyes right now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=532.6400000000001s)]
*  Brought tears to my eyes yesterday. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=534.8800000000001s)]
*  You know, what Senator Booker said [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=537.6400000000001s)]
*  was the God's honest truth. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=541.12s)]
*  There are a lot of black women who watch Cory Booker [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=543.5200000000001s)]
*  and said this is someone who came to really give her [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=546.28s)]
*  the sort of flowers that she deserved. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=550.0s)]
*  You should know that not one of the people you just saw [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=553.64s)]
*  is a poor person. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=557.28s)]
*  Not one of them is oppressed. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=558.36s)]
*  Not one of them has anything at all [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=559.92s)]
*  in common with the people they claim to speak for. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  So they are, to a person, every bit as fraudulent [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=565.64s)]
*  as the people on stage. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=569.72s)]
*  Telling you from the peak of the fake meritocracy [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=571.88s)]
*  that they're somehow fighting against the current. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course the opposite is true. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=579.56s)]
*  But you're not allowed to say it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=582.12s)]
*  But imagine the reserve of energy it takes as a newsman [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  to pretend having shown the clips that we just did [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  that that was anything but horrifying. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  Anything but so fake that the hair on the back of your neck [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  goes up at the fraudulence. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=596.24s)]
*  That's honestly like telling you that Leah Thomas [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=597.88s)]
*  is a deeply accomplished female swimmer who's winning [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=601.88s)]
*  because she just practiced harder than the other girls. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=604.36s)]
*  A lot of the black women who watched that loved it, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=607.64s)]
*  said one NBC journalist, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=610.08s)]
*  person who can't define what a woman is. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=612.08s)]
*  The problem with all this is easy to make fun of, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=615.0s)]
*  but the problem is they are praising [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=616.96s)]
*  a sitting United States Senator, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=618.52s)]
*  remember the Judiciary Committee, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  for asking zero questions during a confirmation hearing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=621.0s)]
*  during which we're choosing the next Supreme Court justice. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=625.2s)]
*  They're saying it is immoral [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=628.96s)]
*  because the way that she looks to ask her real questions. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=631.32s)]
*  She wants to know what we're getting [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=635.32s)]
*  before she takes the seat for life. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  And of course this was the whole point. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  It's the Greta Thunberg play. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=640.6s)]
*  You throw someone up there who represents your views [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  who can't be questioned because anyone who questions [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  the person is of course mean or racist or sexist or whatever. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=647.84s)]
*  Pick your attack, but the person is immune [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  from sincere questions. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=654.12s)]
*  So that's what we're telling you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=656.36s)]
*  And yet somehow it gets even more nauseating. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=657.2s)]
*  The Washington Post editorial board saw that groveling [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=660.84s)]
*  was far enough. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=665.24s)]
*  So they published this headline yesterday, quote, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  Republicans boast they have not pulled a Kavanaugh. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=667.92s)]
*  In fact, they've treated Jackson worse. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=670.72s)]
*  So if you read the Post piece and you shouldn't, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=673.04s)]
*  obviously Jeff Bezos' newspaper is utter garbage. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=676.64s)]
*  You will find that the Post editorial board is a gas [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=679.92s)]
*  that Republicans asked Contangi Jackson about kiddie porn, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=682.88s)]
*  about the sentences she handed down, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=686.76s)]
*  sentences that fell far beneath federal sentencing guidelines. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=688.56s)]
*  And the explanation for her low sentences [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=692.88s)]
*  with the guidelines are written before the internet. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=694.6s)]
*  Now that people can amass huge amounts of kiddie porn, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  the guidelines are too strict. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=700.6s)]
*  That was honestly her explanation. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=702.12s)]
*  Or maybe you agree with it, maybe you don't. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  Tell us the legal principle behind that if you would judge. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=705.36s)]
*  Yet even if you agree that because the internet [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=709.12s)]
*  makes acquiring kiddie porn easier, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  we shouldn't be as tough on kiddie porn. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  If you think that's a fair standard, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  it's certainly fair to ask about it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  No, in a Supreme Court hearing. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=718.64s)]
*  For comparison's sake, and we didn't want to go here, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=721.4s)]
*  it's just too obvious, but we can't control ourselves. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=723.72s)]
*  This is how the emotive, weepy Cory Booker [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=726.24s)]
*  treated the last nominee to the Supreme Court, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=730.0s)]
*  someone whose politics he doesn't agree with. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=732.36s)]
*  He told us at the time that Brett Kavanaugh was so odious, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=734.64s)]
*  so morally filthy, so satanic that anyone who could vote [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=738.92s)]
*  for his nomination was guilty of a mortal sin. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=742.9599999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=745.72s)]
*  In a moral moment, there is no bystanders. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=746.76s)]
*  You are either complicit in the evil, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=751.24s)]
*  you are either contributing to the wrong, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=754.44s)]
*  or you are fighting against it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  And the fake priestess and the fake clerical collar nods. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=761.44s)]
*  It's just so funny. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=765.0s)]
*  If you were to take a survey of the people [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=766.36s)]
*  most likely to give you a moral lecture [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=768.48s)]
*  about your own moral shortcomings, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=771.2s)]
*  they would be the people whose personal lives [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=773.36s)]
*  could withstand the lightest scrutiny, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=775.4s)]
*  if you know what we mean. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=777.64s)]
*  That is a very consistent standard. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=779.16s)]
*  Anyway, no one has used language like that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=781.92s)]
*  to describe opponents of Contangi Jackson, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=785.48s)]
*  even though she let to restate industrial scale pedophiles [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  out of jail with three month jail sentences, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=792.12s)]
*  nor has anyone subjected her to questions [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=794.36s)]
*  about her high school drinking habits. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=797.36s)]
*  Hate to bring it up, but here's what it looked like. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=798.1999999999999s)]
*  Judge Kavanaugh, you drink on weekdays as well [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=801.0s)]
*  on high school, not just weekends. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=804.08s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  On weekdays? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=807.76s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=808.58s)]
*  I'd say that's rare. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=809.4200000000001s)]
*  Are you talking about during the school year? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=811.88s)]
*  I'm talking about the calendars that you provided [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  during these dates. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=815.2800000000001s)]
*  That's in the summer after a football workout [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  when we went over to... [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=819.1600000000001s)]
*  You drank on weekdays, yes or no, sir? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=820.0s)]
*  In the summer, when we went over to Timmy's house [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=822.6s)]
*  on July 1st, that would indicate yes. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=828.48s)]
*  Yes, in other words, that July 1st reference to skis [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=830.84s)]
*  when we went over for skis, that's brew skis, correct? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=834.3599999999999s)]
*  And after Tobin... [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=836.28s)]
*  Sir, sir, I just need a yes or no. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=837.7199999999999s)]
*  That brew skis, right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=838.8399999999999s)]
*  That's the guy lecturing you about God. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=842.16s)]
*  And like all funny people, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=844.76s)]
*  you see a little glints of cruelty and meanness beneath. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=846.16s)]
*  Did you have a beer? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=848.9599999999999s)]
*  Answer the question! [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=849.78s)]
*  And what's funny is that Brett Kavanaugh [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=851.42s)]
*  actually had to answer the question, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=852.92s)]
*  not that it mattered in the end. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  It wouldn't matter what he said. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=855.92s)]
*  Contagio Brown Jackson, meanwhile, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=857.92s)]
*  still is not explaining what the meaning of the word woman is. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=859.3199999999999s)]
*  Are women even real? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  Turns out that question is now above the pay grade [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=863.18s)]
*  of the US Supreme Court. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=865.02s)]
*  Maybe we're meant to think of women as an archetype, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=866.7399999999999s)]
*  a pastiche. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=869.38s)]
*  Maybe they're like T-Bone, the baddest drug lord in Newark. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=871.3399999999999s)]
*  One minute women are here, fully female and authentic, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=874.26s)]
*  filling you in on the gritty details of womanhood. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=876.8599999999999s)]
*  The next thing you know, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=879.3399999999999s)]
*  you drop them off at a housing project [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=880.18s)]
*  and they're gone forever. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2RoUKKNkZw&t=881.9399999999999s)]
