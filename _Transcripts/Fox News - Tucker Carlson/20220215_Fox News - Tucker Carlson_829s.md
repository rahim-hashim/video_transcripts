# Tucker: The media played a starring role in the death of Canadian democracy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight a lot happening in the news. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=2.88s)]
*  Here's one item that we noticed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=4.2s)]
*  Canada canceled democracy last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=5.98s)]
*  And the remarkable thing is no one in this country [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  seemed to notice that it happened. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  There was no outcry from our political class [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=12.14s)]
*  as their friend Justin Trudeau declared martial law [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=14.72s)]
*  in response to an entirely peaceful protest [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=17.26s)]
*  from his country's working class. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=19.46s)]
*  Our news media barely noted that it happened. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=21.42s)]
*  Weirdest of all, the State Department, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=24.18s)]
*  which exists these days, to denounce such attackers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=25.7s)]
*  as democracy is hungry in Poland, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=28.14s)]
*  didn't say a single word as democracy in Canada ended. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  That's pretty weird if you think about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=35.58s)]
*  Canada is not some exotic far away land [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=37.42s)]
*  with an alien culture and an unintelligible language. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=39.72s)]
*  It's not Ukraine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=42.92s)]
*  Canada is our neighbor. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=44.82s)]
*  It's our trading partner. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=46.08s)]
*  Canada is our closest ally on earth, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  especially part of our country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=48.92s)]
*  Our vice president grew up in Canada. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=50.68s)]
*  So did half of our comedians and actors and singers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Our border with Canada is the longest border [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=55.68s)]
*  in the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=57.580000000000005s)]
*  It stretches more than 5,500 miles. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  So on every level, we are deeply intertwined with Canada, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=61.06s)]
*  whether we notice it or not. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=64.78s)]
*  What happens there matters here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=66.06s)]
*  If nothing else, it's a preview of what will likely happen [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=69.08s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  So with that in mind, you should know that Justin Trudeau [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=73.72s)]
*  is no longer the prime minister of Canada. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=75.66s)]
*  Justin Trudeau is Canada's maximum leader. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=78.36s)]
*  It's strong man. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=81.1s)]
*  It's cardio. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=81.94s)]
*  It's potentate. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=82.78s)]
*  Justin Trudeau is the dictator of Canada. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=84.2s)]
*  If you think that's an overstatement, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  try to think of another way to describe [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=88.32s)]
*  what Justin Trudeau is now doing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=90.52s)]
*  For the first time in Canada's history, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=93.24s)]
*  Trudeau has invoked what's known as the Emergencies Act. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=94.86s)]
*  So the protests he is facing hardly qualify as an emergency. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=97.8s)]
*  But suddenly, Justin Trudeau has the power [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  to crush all political opposition to his rule. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=103.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what he's doing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  Trudeau has ended free speech in Canada. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=108.44s)]
*  He's banned free assembly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Trudeau's government has shut down political rallies [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  and arrested his political critics without probable cause. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  Trudeau has instituted internal passports [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=118.22s)]
*  that restrict travel within Canada [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=120.46s)]
*  to the politically obedient. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=122.5s)]
*  Canadians are no longer allowed to leave their own country [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  unless they obey Justin Trudeau. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=127.66s)]
*  And if they don't obey, they could be bankrupted [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=130.22s)]
*  and destroyed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  He now has the power to do that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=133.42s)]
*  Trudeau has claimed the power to freeze the financial assets [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=134.66s)]
*  of any Canadian who resists him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=137.78s)]
*  No court order is required to do this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=139.78s)]
*  He just decides. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=141.94s)]
*  Justin Trudeau can even dictate what you do for a living [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=143.44s)]
*  and how you do it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  Today, Trudeau threatened to arrest tow truck drivers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=147.6s)]
*  who refused to tow the trucks of protesters. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=150.44s)]
*  Is this really about stopping the spread of coronavirus? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=154.32s)]
*  No one in Canada is even pretending that it is anymore. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Trudeau himself didn't mention the risk of COVID [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  a single time yesterday. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=164.04s)]
*  He's not worried about unvaccinated truckers [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  spreading a virus. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Trudeau was worried about Canadians resisting his rule. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  That's why Trudeau's government announced yesterday [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=173.28s)]
*  they plan to regulate cryptocurrency forever. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=175.36s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=178.28s)]
*  We are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=180.32s)]
*  and terrorist financing rules [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=184.94s)]
*  so that they cover crowdfunding platforms [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=187.3s)]
*  and the payment service providers they use. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=190.96s)]
*  These changes cover all forms of transactions, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  including digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=198.44s)]
*  The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=203.8s)]
*  that crowdfunding platforms [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=206.72s)]
*  and some of the payment service providers they use [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=209.08s)]
*  are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=212.84s)]
*  and Terrorist Financing Act. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, the Terrorist Financing Act. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  So that was a law passed to defeat Al-Qaeda. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=223.0s)]
*  Now it's being used to stop law-abiding Canadians, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=225.72s)]
*  middle-class people, students, truck drivers [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  from protecting their earnings [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=230.74s)]
*  from the total mismanagement of Canada's central bank. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=232.38s)]
*  Justin Trudeau has wrecked the Canadian economy, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=236.06s)]
*  but thanks to the Terrorist Financing Act, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=238.62s)]
*  there is no escape from the consequences. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=240.74s)]
*  Canadians are gonna have to live with the consequences [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=242.82s)]
*  of Justin Trudeau's fiscal recklessness, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=245.18s)]
*  whether they want to or not. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=247.22s)]
*  Otherwise, they're terrorists. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=248.7s)]
*  It shouldn't surprise you that Trudeau's first move [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=251.06s)]
*  in the face of a trucker protest [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=253.46s)]
*  was to clamp down on cryptocurrency. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=255.46s)]
*  Democrats will try this in this country, guaranteed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=257.56s)]
*  They'll tell us Bitcoin is a Russian plot. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=260.34s)]
*  CNN will dutifully back them up. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=262.79999999999995s)]
*  Watch it happen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=264.35999999999996s)]
*  But at the same time, you've gotta wonder, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=265.96s)]
*  since we're speaking of terrorism, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=267.44s)]
*  what happened to the actual terrorists? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Those do exist. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=271.2s)]
*  How is Justin Trudeau treating them? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=274.28s)]
*  A few years ago, Justin Trudeau gave more than $10 million [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  in taxpayer money in a settlement [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  to a self-described Al-Qaeda soldier called Omar Khadr. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  Khadr murdered a US Army Sergeant. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, murdering a US Army Sergeant is bad, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  but it's not as bad as criticizing Justin Trudeau. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=289.92s)]
*  So Trudeau did not freeze Khadr's bank account. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=292.3s)]
*  Instead, he just made him rich and moved on. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  When anti-Christian arsonists burned [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  more than 50 Catholic churches across Canada, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=299.38s)]
*  Justin Trudeau did not declare an emergency. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=302.44s)]
*  Instead, he issued a statement sympathizing with them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  Quote, it is fully understandable, Trudeau said, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=307.54s)]
*  given the shameful history [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=310.26s)]
*  we're all becoming more aware of. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  In the beginning, see how this works? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=314.38s)]
*  In a dictatorship, the only real crime [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=316.14s)]
*  is opposing the regime. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=319.1s)]
*  So how did all of this happen so quickly [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  in a country as nice and moderate as Canada? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, it happened the way that it always happened. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=326.0s)]
*  It happened with maximum aggression [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=328.36s)]
*  and limited popular support. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  Justin Trudeau won re-election last year [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  with less than a third of the national vote. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  In fact, he finished the election [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=336.0s)]
*  behind his main competitor, the Conservative Party. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  Thanks to quirks in the parliamentary system, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  Trudeau took power anyway, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=341.88s)]
*  and he immediately began to crack down [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=343.48s)]
*  on anyone who opposed him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=345.04s)]
*  Trudeau had relatively few supporters, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=347.16s)]
*  but they turned out to be the right supporters. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=348.8s)]
*  They were the people with power. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  The woman, for example, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=352.66s)]
*  you just saw announcing the crackdown on cryptocurrency [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=353.5s)]
*  is Canada's deputy prime minister. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  But before she was that, she was a longtime journalist, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=357.94s)]
*  including in our country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=360.3s)]
*  She used to write for the Washington Post. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  She's currently married to a New York Times reporter. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  Why is that relevant? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=366.0s)]
*  Well, because up and down this story, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=367.38s)]
*  you see the starring role that media organizations [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=369.2s)]
*  have played in the death of Canadian democracy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=372.06s)]
*  The other day, for example, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=375.38s)]
*  somebody hacked the database of the crowdfunding website, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=376.56s)]
*  Give Fund Go, and then revealed the names [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=379.92s)]
*  of people who donated to the truckers protesting in Ottawa. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  You gotta ask yourself, who would have the tech savvy [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=386.12s)]
*  and the political motive to do something like that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, state intelligence agencies would. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, we can't really think of anybody else. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=394.6s)]
*  It would certainly be interesting to find out who did it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=396.94s)]
*  It's a big part of the story. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=398.72s)]
*  But media companies seem curiously uninterested [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  in finding out who did it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=402.72s)]
*  Instead, they immediately started using [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=404.24s)]
*  this stolen information to intimidate the donors. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=406.04s)]
*  Anyone who dared to send money [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=409.92s)]
*  to Justin Trudeau's political opponents [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=411.48s)]
*  was unmasked in public, shamed, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=413.0s)]
*  and of course, inevitably threatened, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=415.4s)]
*  because that's what happens. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=417.2s)]
*  Trudeau's state TV channel, the CBC, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=418.8s)]
*  has been working on this retribution project all day long. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=420.8s)]
*  They knew who their enemies are, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=423.68s)]
*  and they knew who their master is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  It's Justin Trudeau. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=426.6s)]
*  But Canada's National Post newspaper is doing the same thing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=428.36s)]
*  The National Post is supposedly independent of the government, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=430.94s)]
*  but they're still doing it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=433.68s)]
*  In this country, Vice Media 2, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=435.08s)]
*  its great and eternal shame has been doing the same thing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=436.7s)]
*  So what do all of these media companies have in common? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=440.78s)]
*  Well, they're all squarely on the side of entrenched power [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  against the population they supposedly serve. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  That's the opposite of what journalism was designed to do, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  but at this point, it is the rule, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=454.7s)]
*  not just in the United States, but around the world. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=456.18s)]
*  Reporters and politicians and big business [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=458.46s)]
*  all align against voters, against you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=464.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, the CBC warned Canadians [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=465.6s)]
*  that the word freedom has, quote, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=468.16s)]
*  become common among far-right groups. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=470.24s)]
*  So only QAnon wants freedom. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=473.36s)]
*  Remember that the next time you complained [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  about Justin Trudeau. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=476.6s)]
*  Media organizations have been agitating [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=478.68s)]
*  against democracy for years now, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=480.56s)]
*  even as they've posed loudly as its greatest defenders. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=482.24s)]
*  In February of 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  Vice Media ran this headline. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  Anti-vaxxers are terrified the government [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=490.16s)]
*  will enforce a vaccine for coronavirus. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  Anti-vaxx groups on social media are claiming [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=495.5s)]
*  that the spread of the disease will lead [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=497.62s)]
*  to mandatory vaccinations and unlimited surveillance. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=499.78s)]
*  Yeah, those conspiracy nuts. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=504.82s)]
*  Now that all of that has actually happened, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=508.26s)]
*  Vice has done apologize and said Vice is helping [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  Justin Trudeau to hurt anyone who complains about it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=512.78s)]
*  In October of that same year, 2020, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=516.5s)]
*  the CBC warned Canadians about a, quote, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=518.76s)]
*  disinformation campaign that, quote, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=521.0s)]
*  falsely suggests Canadians will be forcibly sent [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=523.12s)]
*  to quarantine sites. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=526.08s)]
*  A few months later, as if on cue, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=527.96s)]
*  the Trudeau government began forcibly sending Canadians [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=529.52s)]
*  to quarantine sites. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=532.12s)]
*  But the CBC never apologized for promoting [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=533.96s)]
*  what turned out to be disinformation. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=536.2s)]
*  Instead, they set about enforcing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=538.86s)]
*  Justin Trudeau's latest decrees. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  They see that as their job. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=543.0s)]
*  So by the way, there's the so-called academic community. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=544.98s)]
*  These are the university professors [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=547.88s)]
*  who have been granted lifetime job security [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=549.26s)]
*  precisely so they can think for themselves, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=551.7s)]
*  freely, independent from government control. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=553.82s)]
*  And yet in practice, no one is more controlled [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=556.48s)]
*  by the government than they are. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=559.26s)]
*  Here's a professor from Canada's Carleton University, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=561.58s)]
*  that's an institution heavily funded by Justin Trudeau, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=564.22s)]
*  telling CNN's viewers how dangerous and immoral it is [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=567.42s)]
*  to criticize Justin Trudeau in any way. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=570.46s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=573.3s)]
*  I think it's important to remember [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=574.5s)]
*  that at the core of this protest, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=575.94s)]
*  it was never really about mandates in the first place. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=579.04s)]
*  It's always been about a small group of people [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=581.4s)]
*  who called for a convoy who hold very anti-government views [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=583.74s)]
*  as well as kind of a racist and white supremacist views, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=589.34s)]
*  conspiratorial worldviews. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=591.92s)]
*  Oh, they hold anti-government views, that's the crime. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=594.54s)]
*  But isn't holding anti-government views allowed [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=598.08s)]
*  in a democracy? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=601.16s)]
*  In fact, isn't the measure of democratic government [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=602.86s)]
*  the degree to which you're allowed to question the people [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=605.92s)]
*  in charge? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=608.34s)]
*  Well, that used to be the definition of democracy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=609.5200000000001s)]
*  It's not anymore, certainly not on CNN. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  The CNN anchor who heard that just nodded. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=614.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes, it is indeed a scary problem [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=616.58s)]
*  when Canadians disagree with Justin Trudeau. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=618.46s)]
*  Arrest them. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  On MSNBC, which is less subtle, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  but a lot more straightforward most of the time, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=624.22s)]
*  they're telling Justin Trudeau to stop with the half measures. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=626.3000000000001s)]
*  The problem with Canada is it's not authoritarian enough. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=629.4000000000001s)]
*  Time to get the stick and start hurting people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=633.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=635.6400000000001s)]
*  I do have to ask one question though [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=637.12s)]
*  about the Liberal Prime Minister in Canada. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=638.86s)]
*  Seriously, I'm sorry. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=641.46s)]
*  I'm sorry, if I'm a mayor or I'm a prime minister, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=643.9s)]
*  your trucks get in my city street, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=646.46s)]
*  they're not gonna stay there a week. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, they're not gonna stay. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=652.4s)]
*  There's gonna be somebody with a stick [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=654.4s)]
*  and it's gonna be banging on the window. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=656.9s)]
*  It's gonna say, you got one of two options, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=658.6800000000001s)]
*  you can move this thing or we're gonna cuff you [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=660.44s)]
*  and take you to jail and we're gonna impound this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=662.38s)]
*  and we're gonna find your company. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=664.4200000000001s)]
*  Move it or lose it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=665.84s)]
*  Move it or lose it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  Settle down, tough guy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=669.5200000000001s)]
*  There's gonna be someone there with a stick. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=670.7800000000001s)]
*  It's interesting, it's always the very same people [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  who call for violence. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=675.72s)]
*  It's almost like it excites them. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=676.96s)]
*  That's not a good sign. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=679.86s)]
*  So clearly there is an appetite [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=681.32s)]
*  for Canadian-style tyranny in this country. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=682.96s)]
*  So the question is how long till we get it? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=685.6s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=687.2s)]
*  This morning we learned that American intelligence agencies [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=688.6s)]
*  are trying to censor a financial website called Zero Hedge. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=691.2600000000001s)]
*  Unnamed sources from Joe Biden's intel community [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=695.16s)]
*  told the Associated Press, off the record of course, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=697.6999999999999s)]
*  that Zero Hedge was quote, spreading Russian propaganda [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=699.9s)]
*  by which they meant criticizing Joe Biden. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=703.1s)]
*  We can't have that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=705.54s)]
*  So how long before they pull Zero Hedge off the internet? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=707.24s)]
*  How long before they try the same thing [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=710.58s)]
*  with Joe Biden's many other critics in the media, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=712.14s)]
*  all of whom we can tell you firsthand, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=714.18s)]
*  have also been accused of working for Vladimir Putin? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=716.22s)]
*  And when that does happen, when these voices are silenced, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=719.46s)]
*  what will we call it then? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=722.26s)]
*  CNN will of course describe it [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  as a necessary national security measure, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=725.2399999999999s)]
*  but it's not that, it's tyranny. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, since when does the CIA get to decide [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=730.16s)]
*  what websites Americans read? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=732.5799999999999s)]
*  Are there any civil libertarians left in this country? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=734.8199999999999s)]
*  Old fashioned liberals, anyone? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=736.8s)]
*  What do they think of this? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=738.26s)]
*  Maybe they don't notice it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=739.9s)]
*  In their defense, it's hard to notice sometimes [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  with leaders like Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=743.4s)]
*  They don't look very threatening. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=745.26s)]
*  They're not the Hollywood version of fascist. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=747.0s)]
*  Look at Justin Trudeau. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=749.54s)]
*  He's absurd. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=750.9s)]
*  The 70s haircut, all those little outfits [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=752.52s)]
*  where he feels like playing dress up. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=754.86s)]
*  He doesn't look dangerous, he looks ridiculous. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=756.96s)]
*  But maybe Justin Trudeau is smarter than he looks. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=759.76s)]
*  Leaders like Biden and Trudeau avoid the usual tells. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=762.6s)]
*  They don't use armies to invade other countries, for example. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=765.9s)]
*  Instead, they promote color revolutions [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=769.56s)]
*  and control foreign governments from afar. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=771.36s)]
*  That's exactly what they did in Ukraine, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=774.58s)]
*  which became a far more repressive place [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=776.24s)]
*  once Joe Biden began running it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=778.92s)]
*  And he does run Ukraine, make no mistake. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=780.54s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  This new class of dictator seizes power incrementally [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=784.78s)]
*  through the bureaucracy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=787.98s)]
*  They never raise their voices. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=789.52s)]
*  They don't wave their arms. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=791.0799999999999s)]
*  They smile and they tell you they're protecting democracy [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=792.42s)]
*  and public health. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=795.26s)]
*  They praise diversity, even as they demand conformity. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=796.76s)]
*  They're entirely passive aggressive. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=800.26s)]
*  But they're no less dangerous. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=803.1s)]
*  One morning you wake up and they've canceled your job [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=804.4s)]
*  and seized your bank account [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=806.5s)]
*  for the crime of disagreeing with them. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=807.8s)]
*  This is the architecture of tyranny. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=808.98s)]
*  And it's not just happening in Canada, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=811.1s)]
*  it's happening here in the United States. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=812.74s)]
*  It will be used against us. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=814.22s)]
*  Bet on it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2H3EO_zinU&t=816.02s)]
