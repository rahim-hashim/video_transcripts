# Chris Cuomo was carrying CNN's ratings: Coglianese
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84)
*  So what happens to CNN without Chris Cuomo? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, here is exclusive footage this show has just obtained [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=2.7s)]
*  of the Dwarf King and his minions, including Don LaMonde, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=5.44s)]
*  putting Chris Cuomo in a shallow grave. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=9.08s)]
*  Again, these images are just sent to our news department. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=10.78s)]
*  Of course, no one is going to be hit harder by today's news [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=13.52s)]
*  than Cuomo's best on-air friend, Don LaMonde. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=17.18s)]
*  You'll probably never see moments like this again [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  on national television. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=21.86s)]
*  People have been asking me, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=24.0s)]
*  what are you gonna give Chris for Valentine's Day? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=25.62s)]
*  And so here it is, Chris. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=28.56s)]
*  I have a card for you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=30.16s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=31.48s)]
*  And there you go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=32.92s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=33.92s)]
*  I knew you would think it was beautiful [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=35.76s)]
*  because you're surrounded. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=37.26s)]
*  You didn't want to put your face in here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=38.8s)]
*  Why? It wouldn't fit? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=40.6s)]
*  Because that would be like me loving myself. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=41.6s)]
*  That's what you're about. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=43.76s)]
*  First of all, can we just, for the sake of Valentine's Day, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=44.84s)]
*  can we stop this projection of where I am the one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=47.84s)]
*  who's so into myself? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Looking at moments like that, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=54.92s)]
*  you no longer really feel that sorry for Chris Cuomo. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  Assuming he can get a job or he's saved enough to live, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=60.28s)]
*  at least he won't have to do that again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=62.92s)]
*  Vince Colonese is a radio host in the city of Washington. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  We're always happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=69.18s)]
*  Vince, what do you make of this? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=70.72s)]
*  Well, boy, I tell you, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  I think I figured out why Chris Cuomo lifts so much. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=74.2s)]
*  It's because he was the only guy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=76.4s)]
*  carrying that network's ratings. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  As small as those ratings were, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  the reality is Chris Cuomo was the only draw [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=82.34s)]
*  that that network has had. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=84.66s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=85.86s)]
*  CNN once had a legendary status [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=86.84s)]
*  as being the type of place where you could turn to for news. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=89.2s)]
*  That's gone. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=91.14s)]
*  That's been gone for many years now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=91.98s)]
*  The last big star on the network was Larry King. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=93.7s)]
*  They tried making Anderson Cooper the face of the network. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=96.88s)]
*  They gave him multiple hours during prime time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=100.08s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=102.32s)]
*  So in 2018, they turned to their morning guy, Chris Cuomo, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=103.52s)]
*  and they said, please do something. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=106.16s)]
*  And he was the best that they could come up with. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=107.86s)]
*  As Jason Whitlock said, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=110.02s)]
*  the typical American meathead was about the only thing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=111.32s)]
*  that was actually getting an audience. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=113.82s)]
*  And that's why when you just played that Don Lemon clip, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=115.42s)]
*  that was happening every night. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=118.6s)]
*  The reason that was happening [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=119.8s)]
*  is because Don Lemon can't get ratings on his own. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=121.2s)]
*  They had to have 15 minute handoffs with Chris Cuomo [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=123.44s)]
*  just to get people to tune into something else [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=126.46s)]
*  on the network. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=129.3s)]
*  This is gonna be a big problem for CNN going forward. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=130.6s)]
*  That's such a good point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=133.38s)]
*  I mean, admittedly, being the highest rated anchor on CNN [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=134.4s)]
*  really is being like the best caterer in Uzbekistan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's a relative measure. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=140.68s)]
*  But I mean, he was number one, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  and they fired the number one guy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=145.12s)]
*  because the Atlantic Magazine told them to. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=146.78s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=149.46s)]
*  Isn't this supposed to be a business? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, isn't, right, you think of this as a business [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=152.72s)]
*  where the outcome is measurable, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=155.02s)]
*  the guy with the highest ratings, but didn't matter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=157.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  And what happens now is that this is kind of a good tell [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  for what our ruling class is interested in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  The elites are very insular. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=167.5s)]
*  They don't actually care [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=168.78s)]
*  what the average audience member is interested in. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't care that the way you probably have watched CNN [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=172.36s)]
*  through the last few years [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=174.8s)]
*  has been you accidentally bumped into it in an airport. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=175.86s)]
*  It's not about that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=178.16s)]
*  It's about what are their friends [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=179.3s)]
*  at the New York Times think? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=180.5s)]
*  The second the New York Times [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=181.54s)]
*  and the Atlantic turned against Chris Cuomo, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Chris Cuomo was thrown off the ship. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  This is, it's a, these are people who do not care [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=187.28s)]
*  about the average American. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=190.94s)]
*  They care more about the people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=192.78s)]
*  they're gonna encounter at lunch, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=194.02s)]
*  probably at a place that I can't afford. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=195.72s)]
*  Imagine working for a company [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=197.84s)]
*  in which your boss cares what the Atlantic Magazine thinks. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=200.04s)]
*  I mean, that's, it's beyond. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=203.84s)]
*  Imagine knowing someone [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=206.62s)]
*  who cares what the Atlantic Magazine thinks [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  or who reads the New York Times and takes it seriously. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=210.32s)]
*  Oh, find new friends. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=213.18s)]
*  Speaking of something you only bump into at an airport. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=214.66s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=216.76s)]
*  Right, it's totally right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=217.6s)]
*  Vince Colonese, great to see you, Jay. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=219.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXIvNszlS84&t=220.66s)]
