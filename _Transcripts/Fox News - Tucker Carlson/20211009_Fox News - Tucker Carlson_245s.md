# Fed up mom forms group to fight scholastic indoctrination
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0)
*  The Biden administration has now unleashed the most powerful law enforcement apparatus in the world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=0.0s)]
*  the U.S. Department of Justice, against American parents, middle-class parents whose kids go to public school, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=6.0s)]
*  and who voice any opposition whatsoever to the racism now being pushed on their kids. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=12.0s)]
*  Why are they doing this? Because something called the National School Boards Association [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=18.0s)]
*  has told DOJ that these parents are domestic terrorists. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=22.0s)]
*  At a recent briefing at the White House, Joe Biden's Chief Flack apparently agreed with that assessment. Watch. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=26.0s)]
*  Threats and violence are illegal. They're rarely prosecuted, if ever, when they're committed by loyal Democratic voters. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=56.0s)]
*  But that's not the point. The Department of Justice did not give a single example of threats or violence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=78.0s)]
*  These are thought crimes that are being prosecuted here. Erika Sanzi knows that well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=83.0s)]
*  She's a parent and founder of Parents Defending Education, and she joins us tonight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=87.0s)]
*  Erika, thanks so much for coming on. So you've basically, because you want some say in what your own children are taught by government schools, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=91.0s)]
*  you have been likened to a domestic terrorist. Where does this leave you? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=99.0s)]
*  So it leaves me frustrated, but not surprised. Over the summer, the teachers' union signaled, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=104.0s)]
*  actually they didn't signal, they said explicitly that they were going to invest money in investigating parent groups. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=112.0s)]
*  So we knew that something like this might be coming. And it's clear that school boards and school officials are simply not used to this level of scrutiny. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=119.0s)]
*  They are. I was on a school committee, so I can say that this is something new. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=130.0s)]
*  COVID blew the curtain wide open, and now parents are expressing concerns over a variety of things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=134.0s)]
*  And it seems that almost regardless of what it is that they are expressing frustration about, they are they are mocked, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=142.0s)]
*  they are dismissed, or they are told that it's going to cost them many thousands of dollars to get the information that they're asking for. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=150.0s)]
*  So we're obviously very concerned, particularly because it takes a lot of courage for parents to go before school boards [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=156.0s)]
*  and express their thoughts and how they're feeling about what's happening in their children's school. It doesn't come naturally to most people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=164.0s)]
*  And so when we saw this come down from the Department of Justice, we knew that it was an attempt to intimidate parents into silence, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=170.0s)]
*  even though they are not doing anything wrong. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=176.0s)]
*  No, no. In fact, they're they're doing what they're required to do as parents, which is look out for the best interests of their own children and as citizens, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=179.0s)]
*  which is to speak up with elected officials. So when there were concerns about police brutality and the misuse of police powers, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=185.0s)]
*  reformers pushed for body camps. And their argument was if you've got nothing to hide, why wouldn't you allow it to be on tape? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=191.0s)]
*  And that's happened across the country. Why don't we have cameras in classrooms, every single classroom? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=198.0s)]
*  So that's an interesting question. And the truth is, I still come down on the side against cameras, though I certainly understand the impulse for people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=203.0s)]
*  wanting that to happen. But I do take your point about the hypocrisy. The same people that wanted to defund the police now want to stick the FBI on parents. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=212.0s)]
*  And the same people that were for cameras are now saying that parents don't even have a right to see the curricular materials being used in their children's schools. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it really is like a deep question. Whose children are they? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=231.0s)]
*  Do they belong to the teachers union or do you? You are a brave person to persevere in the face of this. And I appreciate it. Hope you'll come back. Erica, thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfk10BZDaV0&t=235.0s)]
