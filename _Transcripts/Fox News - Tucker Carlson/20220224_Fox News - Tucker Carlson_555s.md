# Tucker: This is what we should be worried about
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po)
*  So what's happening in Ukraine, whatever its scale, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=0.0s)]
*  and it's not totally clear right now, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=3.66s)]
*  but whatever it is, it's a tragedy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=5.4s)]
*  because war always is a tragedy, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=6.9s)]
*  and the closer you get to it, the more horrifying it seems. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=8.76s)]
*  It's the ugliest thing that men do ever. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=12.36s)]
*  Vladimir Putin started this war, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=14.94s)]
*  so whatever the context of the decision that he made, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=16.72s)]
*  he did it, he fired the first shots. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=18.96s)]
*  He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight in Ukraine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=20.84s)]
*  The question is, once we've established that, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  and it's obvious, how should the United States respond [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  to what he has done? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=29.6s)]
*  So within minutes of the outbreak of the war last night, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=31.3s)]
*  the usual liars on television began leveraging this tragedy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=33.64s)]
*  for partisan political gain. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  If you ever watched the aftermath of a school shooting, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=38.44s)]
*  you're familiar with how they behave, it's contemptible. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=40.28s)]
*  But we're gonna ignore it tonight [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  because there is too much else going on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=43.92s)]
*  that actually matters, and the main thing that matters [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=45.92s)]
*  in any crisis is deciding what's most important, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=48.0s)]
*  creating a hierarchy of concern. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=51.24s)]
*  So until last night, the main purpose of our foreign policy [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=53.72s)]
*  was to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=56.52s)]
*  Obviously that failed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=58.56s)]
*  At some point we should figure out why. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=60.52s)]
*  But what's our top goal now? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, there's several of them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=65.28s)]
*  Here are the first three. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=66.44s)]
*  First and most obviously, avoid a full-scale war [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=68.08s)]
*  with a nuclear armed adversary. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=70.68s)]
*  And to be fair, very few people in Washington [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=72.72s)]
*  want anything like that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=74.84s)]
*  War with Russia is so obviously a bad idea. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=76.4s)]
*  But that doesn't mean we won't have one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=79.58s)]
*  Wars often break out accidentally, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=81.86s)]
*  or more often incrementally. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=83.72s)]
*  Things escalate, and the next thing you know, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=85.76s)]
*  you've got Verdun with many thousands dead. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=87.46s)]
*  Now that shooting has started in Ukraine, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  it is entirely possible, no matter what they assure you, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=92.66s)]
*  that Americans could wind up getting hurt in Eastern Europe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  We should prevent that, but preventing it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=99.96s)]
*  will require wisdom and farsightedness [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=101.61999999999999s)]
*  and emotional control, all of which are never [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=104.02s)]
*  in abundant supply in Washington, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  and especially now that everyone is justifiably upset. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=109.41999999999999s)]
*  Again, what Russia has done is awful, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=113.3s)]
*  but we could still make it worse. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=115.64s)]
*  Mark Warner, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=118.08s)]
*  just announced that Russia could be potentially close [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=120.24s)]
*  to triggering what's known as Article 5 of the NATO alliance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=123.92s)]
*  That's a collective defense principle. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=127.56s)]
*  So if Russia were to launch a cyber attack on Ukraine, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=129.68s)]
*  Warner explained, an attack that affects nearby NATO members [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=133.12s)]
*  like Poland or Lithuania, then possibly every NATO country, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=135.86s)]
*  including ours, the United States, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=140.32s)]
*  would be obligated to declare war on Russia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=142.58s)]
*  Here he is explaining. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=145.78s)]
*  One of the things that I'm gravely concerned about [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=147.9s)]
*  is if Russia unleashes its full cyber power against Ukraine, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=150.78s)]
*  once you put malware into the wild, in a sense, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=156.18s)]
*  it knows no geographic boundaries. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  So if the Russians decide they're going to try [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  to turn off the power, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  turn off all the electricity all across Ukraine, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=166.02s)]
*  very likely that may turn off the power in Eastern Poland [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=168.86s)]
*  and Eastern Romania. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=172.38s)]
*  That could affect our troops. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=173.78s)]
*  If suddenly hospitals are shut down, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=175.62s)]
*  if those NATO troops, American troops, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  somehow have a car accident [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  because the stoplights don't work, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=182.78s)]
*  we are suddenly in an area of, hypothetically, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=185.54s)]
*  an Article 5 where one NATO country is attacked. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=188.46s)]
*  We all have to come to each other's aid. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=191.74s)]
*  So Warner is certainly right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=194.66s)]
*  That could add, that hypothetical that he outlined [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=195.94s)]
*  could happen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=198.74s)]
*  Any cyber attack on Ukraine could well affect [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=199.62s)]
*  the infrastructure of their Eastern European countries. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=203.1s)]
*  That would be bad. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=205.94s)]
*  It would be a crime. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=206.78s)]
*  The civilized world would deplore it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=207.62s)]
*  But Article 5 is not a mechanical mechanism. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=210.3s)]
*  Human beings have to decide to invoke it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=214.26s)]
*  And the question is, is what the Senator just described [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  something that is worth risking a nuclear conflict over? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=221.3s)]
*  And that is something we should pause very deeply [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=225.34s)]
*  to think about in the most sober possible way. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=228.1s)]
*  And we hope that our leaders are. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=231.06s)]
*  But not all of them seem sober right now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=233.34s)]
*  Some of them seem reckless and as usual ignorant. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=235.3s)]
*  Congressman Adam Kinziger of Illinois, for example, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=238.78s)]
*  spends a lot of time on cable television [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=240.9s)]
*  talking about world affairs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=242.54s)]
*  He seems like an expert. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  And yet by temperament, he's certainly the last person [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=245.82s)]
*  you want anywhere near a nuclear button. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=247.86s)]
*  Today, Kinziger informed us that Russia's seizure [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=249.5s)]
*  of the defunct Chernobyl plant might, quote, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  trigger Article 5. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=254.18s)]
*  Okay, it could be interpreted that way. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=256.22s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=258.22s)]
*  Clearly Adam Kinziger hasn't thought about that, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=260.3s)]
*  not for a moment. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=262.18s)]
*  So you see the problem here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=263.02s)]
*  The question is not who's at fault. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=264.7s)]
*  We can say that Vladimir Putin is at fault [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=267.06s)]
*  for what happened last night. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=269.42s)]
*  But then what? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=271.38s)]
*  And that's the larger problem. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=273.62s)]
*  Once conflict starts, especially when that conflict [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=274.74s)]
*  is televised, it's really hard to know what happens next. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=277.18s)]
*  So anyone who thinks the invasion of Ukraine [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=281.26s)]
*  couldn't become a world war either lacks imagination [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=283.5s)]
*  or is lying to you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=287.26s)]
*  It certainly could become a world war. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=288.26s)]
*  So that's the first goal, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  not making a terrible thing much, much worse. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=291.58s)]
*  Here's the second goal, keep the energy flowing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=295.34s)]
*  Cheap energy, we take it for granted, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  but it is the basis of all we have. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  No energy, no civilization. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=303.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, a huge percentage of Europe's energy [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=306.46s)]
*  now comes from Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  The European Union relies on Russia [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=311.26s)]
*  for roughly 40% of its natural gas. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=313.06s)]
*  In Germany, which is one of the biggest economies [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  in the world, that percentage is over half, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=317.54s)]
*  most of its energy in the form of natural gas [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=319.34s)]
*  comes from Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=322.38s)]
*  So you don't hear that very often on television. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=324.66s)]
*  This debate is framed exclusively in moral terms [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=326.66s)]
*  and those are important, we shouldn't ignore them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=328.82s)]
*  But they're not the only terms we should consider. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  The fact is that Vladimir Putin has the power [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=333.98s)]
*  to send Europe and for that matter, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  potentially the United States into an economic depression. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=337.82s)]
*  Putin has the power to turn off the lights. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=341.5s)]
*  So where did Vladimir Putin get this power? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=344.98s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of reasons, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=348.3s)]
*  but a big reason is the climate people gave him this power. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=349.3s)]
*  Thanks to pressure from zealots like John Kerry, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=352.42s)]
*  Europe has been shutting down nuclear power plants for years. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=354.54s)]
*  And that's a very confusing strategy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=359.26s)]
*  If you're worried about climate, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=361.66s)]
*  nuclear energy is not the problem, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=362.66s)]
*  nuclear energy is the solution. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=364.18s)]
*  It's reliable, it's domestically produced, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=365.98s)]
*  it emits no carbon. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=367.9s)]
*  So if you were genuinely worried about temperature rises, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=368.9s)]
*  global warming, you would embrace nuclear energy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=371.9s)]
*  But our leaders and not just ours globally across the West [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=375.38s)]
*  have done the opposite, why? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=378.26s)]
*  Maybe their donors and families are invested [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=380.29999999999995s)]
*  in so-called renewable technologies, who knows? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=382.02s)]
*  Whatever the reason, because of a series [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=383.9s)]
*  of very specific decisions made over time, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  the West is now dangerously dependent [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=389.78s)]
*  on Vladimir Putin for energy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  Now our leaders may act like this is not a big deal. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  It is definitely a big deal, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=397.9s)]
*  and we ought to make decisions based on that fact. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=399.34s)]
*  And finally, a topic no one ever brings up, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=402.7s)]
*  we must protect the US dollar. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=405.06s)]
*  America's power derives from its wealth. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=407.94s)]
*  Rich countries get to do what they want. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=410.94s)]
*  Poor countries must obey their masters or they get invaded. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=413.38s)]
*  We just saw that happen, that is the unchanging rule. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=416.9s)]
*  In this country, control of the US dollar [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=420.17999999999995s)]
*  is the key to our wealth. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=422.5s)]
*  Our entire financialized debt-based economy [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=424.62s)]
*  rests on the unique privilege [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=427.5s)]
*  of issuing the world's reserve currency. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=429.41999999999996s)]
*  If the US dollar is ever replaced, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  we are in legitimate trouble. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  Our debt will come due, our government will go bankrupt, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=437.34s)]
*  and millions of Americans will become poor immediately. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=440.18s)]
*  So this is the main thing we ought to be worried about, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=443.74s)]
*  and it is a greater risk now than ever before. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  Sanctions are an emotionally satisfying way [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=449.97999999999996s)]
*  to punish someone like Vladimir Putin [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=452.26s)]
*  who clearly does deserve to be punished. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=453.85999999999996s)]
*  No one's really against sanctions. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=456.06s)]
*  But the question is, do they work? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=458.66s)]
*  Clearly, multiple sanctions did not prevent [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=461.9s)]
*  last night's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=464.26s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=466.06s)]
*  At the same time, sanctions give Russia [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  and many other countries across the world [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=469.94s)]
*  a strong incentive to dump the US dollar, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=471.82s)]
*  which is the means by which we enforce sanctions. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  So last summer, for example, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=477.9s)]
*  in a story that most people didn't pay enough attention to, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=479.58s)]
*  Russia, in response to sanctions, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=482.3s)]
*  completely removed the US dollar, its assets, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=484.54s)]
*  from its sovereign wealth fund, its national wealth fund. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=487.02000000000004s)]
*  The Chinese noticed, they understand exactly how this works, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=490.22s)]
*  and in their effort to displace the United States, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=493.54s)]
*  they are strongly in favor of it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  China is trying to become the first major country [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=497.74s)]
*  in the world whose central bank [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=499.70000000000005s)]
*  issues sovereign digital currency. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=501.3s)]
*  If that works, and many efforts like it, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=504.5s)]
*  it would be a huge loss for the United States, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=506.5s)]
*  an irreplaceable loss that would change this country forever, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=509.26s)]
*  much more than an invasion of Ukraine. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=512.14s)]
*  So we should be watching that, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=515.9s)]
*  attacks on the primacy of the US dollar globally, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=517.38s)]
*  every bit as intently as we watch the coverage [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=520.46s)]
*  currently on television of the hot war. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=522.86s)]
*  If at the end of this conflict, whenever that is, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=525.78s)]
*  countries around the world have come to see [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=528.3s)]
*  the Chinese yuan as a stronger, more stable currency [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=530.42s)]
*  than the US dollar, then this country will have lost [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=534.46s)]
*  more than we understand. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=537.5s)]
*  Somebody needs to be paying attention to this. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=539.02s)]
*  Let's fervently hope that somebody is. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnKez4bL0po&t=541.34s)]
