# The DOJ's double standards becoming clear: Maron
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI)
*  The BLM riots last summer caused several deaths, probably a dozen, more than a billion dollars [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=0.0s)]
*  in property damage in this country, most of which has not been rebuilt. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=5.32s)]
*  In case you've forgotten, here's what they look like. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=8.6s)]
*  We got a bear scream! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=11.36s)]
*  We got a bear scream! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=14.36s)]
*  Give me your arms! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=17.36s)]
*  That's all been memory holed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=30.0s)]
*  Save it on your hard drive. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=39.36s)]
*  It probably won't be available soon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=40.36s)]
*  But the spirit lives on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=43.2s)]
*  Just days ago, a BLM activist called Hawk Newsome threatened the newly elected mayor [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=44.2s)]
*  of New York City, Eric Adams, who for the record is also black, but whatever. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=48.64s)]
*  Newsome promised, quote, riots and bloodshed if the new mayor dares to enforce the law. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=53.2s)]
*  The existing laws of the city of New York are going to kill people if you dare do that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=61.32000000000001s)]
*  So that's a threat of violence. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=66.72s)]
*  What's interesting is that Merrick Garland, who's our attorney general, our chief law [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=68.16s)]
*  enforcement officer, hasn't even acknowledged it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=71.76s)]
*  Instead, he's been targeting parents who complain about school boards because they're terrorists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=74.76s)]
*  Today, a DOJ whistleblower came forward with evidence that Merrick Garland has been using [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=80.08s)]
*  counterterrorism tools to investigate parents who don't like being told that they're racist. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=83.88s)]
*  Because you have to sit there and take it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  You're racist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=91.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=92.8s)]
*  So, counterterrorism officials created a so-called threat tag to allow multiple federal agencies [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=93.8s)]
*  to track parents as if they were domestic terrorists, like they're ISIS. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=99.64s)]
*  So if this is true, it would mean it's time to impeach and prosecute Merrick Garland because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=104.16s)]
*  he just lied under oath during his recent sworn testimony on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=109.36s)]
*  Maud Marin is a lawyer and parents' rights advocate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=114.56s)]
*  We need a lot more of those. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=116.92s)]
*  Also, a former New York City council candidate joins us now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=117.92s)]
*  Maud, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=121.32s)]
*  So here you have... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=124.52s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=125.92s)]
*  ...a guy threatening the new mayor of New York with violence if he dares to enforce [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=126.92s)]
*  the law. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=131.6s)]
*  The Justice Department ignores it and spends its time classifying people like you as al-Qaeda. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=132.6s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=138.0s)]
*  Well, I was pretty shocked, I have to say, when I read the letter that Merrick Garland [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=139.8s)]
*  wrote responding to the National School Board Association letter. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=145.96s)]
*  And that letter from the National School Board Association asked the government to classify [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  parents like me as domestic terrorists. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  And Merrick Garland responded very quickly to that letter and said that he would take [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=157.8s)]
*  action, that he would create a federal task force. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=161.72s)]
*  And he doubled down on the letter that he wrote when he was testifying before Congress. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=164.52s)]
*  That doubling down and that enthusiasm for prosecuting parents could not stand in any [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=169.52s)]
*  stronger opposition to the silence that we're hearing now when, as you correctly point out, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  activists who were rioting last summer in New York City are now telling our new mayor-elect [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=181.44s)]
*  that if he implements the policies that he campaigned on to get the rising violence in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=187.28s)]
*  New York City in check, that if he implements those policies, there will be fire, riots, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  and bloodshed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=198.92s)]
*  That's their words. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=199.92s)]
*  It's almost like some people in authority consider lunatics like that, threatening violence, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  like their own personal militia, that they don't restrain them from doing the bidding [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=207.32s)]
*  of a political party. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=211.2s)]
*  It almost seems that way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=212.2s)]
*  Well, what we heard a lot last summer, while riots were going on in New York City, in my [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=213.2s)]
*  neighborhood, the stores were broken into and there was broken glass on the street for [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=220.56s)]
*  days as we saw stores boarding up their windows. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  What we saw was a discussion of those riots as protests. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=229.2s)]
*  There's a big difference between protests and riots, and everyday parents and the families [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=232.76s)]
*  of New York City know the difference. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=236.72s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  And you can't destroy our cities. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  Not everybody can move to Montana. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  You can't let our biggest city become a cesspool. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  And so I'm just grateful that you're fighting all of this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=247.96s)]
*  Ma Maren, I hope you'll come back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=250.88s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=251.88s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYtdYb60RI&t=254.16s)]
