# Tulsi Gabbard: This is government bureaucracy at its worst
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY)
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a former congresswoman and presidential candidate, joins us now to react. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, this is your party, I understand it, but does this help Americans to put the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=4.4s)]
*  IRS on steroids and double their personnel? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=9.64s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  You know, you look at those numbers that you broke out and the messaging that's coming [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=16.2s)]
*  out of the Democrats in Congress saying, hey, this will only apply to the wealthy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=20.36s)]
*  We're only taxing the wealthy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=23.88s)]
*  Well, that's only 1 to 2 percent of all taxpayers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=25.0s)]
*  So why in the world do they need $80 billion and 87,000 new hires in order to go after [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=28.56s)]
*  1 to 2 percent of taxpayers? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=35.76s)]
*  Their math absolutely does not add up, which should be frightening and concerning because [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=37.72s)]
*  this means exactly what you said. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  They're coming after us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=44.56s)]
*  They're coming after entrepreneurs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=45.56s)]
*  They're coming after small business owners. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=46.56s)]
*  They're coming after our middle class, hardworking Americans. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=48.44s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  And then you layer on top of that what you just mentioned. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=53.36s)]
*  with the power of enforcement of a gun, essentially, and how we have already seen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=57.88s)]
*  It's not a theory that the IRS has also, like many of these other federal agencies, abused [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=63.84s)]
*  their power to go after political opponents. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  We have seen them do this with Lois Lerner under the Obama administration. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  There were no consequences there, and she was directly targeting blatantly conservative [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=75.84s)]
*  organizations. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=81.88s)]
*  And so this dangerous trend that we are seeing that happened gradually over years, but everything [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=83.42s)]
*  from the IRS to Department of Homeland Security, their counterterrorism division, the FBI, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  the Department of Justice, we are seeing how they are more blatantly in broad daylight [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  being weaponized to target political opponents of those in power and anyone who dares to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=99.18s)]
*  dissent or question or challenge their actions and policies. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=104.56s)]
*  Do you realize that their system is so antiquated that I think they were using cobalt and they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=109.06s)]
*  can't keep up with the amount of calls? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=114.62s)]
*  I think they get 1,200 calls per second around the country with people who are confused about [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=116.34s)]
*  our complex tax system, which keeps changing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=120.66000000000001s)]
*  Do you know that out of all the money that's earmarked for the IRS, only five of the $87 [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=123.86s)]
*  billion is improving the technology? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=128.54000000000002s)]
*  How dumb is that? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  It's worse than dumb. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=135.82s)]
*  This is government bureaucracy at its worst. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=137.38s)]
*  Rather than actually identifying the problem and saying, hey, how do we more efficiently [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  serve the needs of the American people and increase our ability to deliver and serve [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=144.94s)]
*  them, they are taking our money. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=150.66s)]
*  This is money that is coming out of our pockets and our paychecks to go and plus up their [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=152.9s)]
*  force and their ability to go and take more money from us rather than actually fixing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=157.3s)]
*  the inefficiencies in their antiquated systems. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=162.98s)]
*  51% of the audits last year went after taxpayers who made less than $75,000. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=165.7s)]
*  So unless they're going to change their doctrine all of a sudden, I'm pretty sure that the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  average American is going to feel the scrutiny of the IRS in a way that we're not prepared [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  for nor do we have the high-price accounting firms to fight for us for in many cases, unless [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=180.94s)]
*  someone to TurboTax is going to help us out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  Thanks so much, Congresswoman. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  It was great to see you, Tulsi. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=190.17999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=193.14s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=194.14s)]
*  Thanks for Friday night. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  You're going to be hosting Tucker. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  So 8 o'clock Eastern time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  That's what I hear. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  No, you can't get out of it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  You're going to be here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-VB6GeEhqY&t=201.57999999999998s)]
