# Attorney speaks out on litigation to stop trans teacher from wearing Z-cup breasts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM)
*  So you may remember in the deep recesses of your brain, that creepy shop teacher in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada who decided to sexualize the kids in his shop class, getting them involved [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=5.24s)]
*  in his weird fetish life. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=10.24s)]
*  The guy uses the name Kayla Lemieux and then shows up to class at Oakville [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=12.88s)]
*  Trafalgar School wearing gigantic prosthetic breasts, apparently emulating a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=16.92s)]
*  style of Japanese pornography called exploding milk porn. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Not making this up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=24.48s)]
*  Wish we were. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=25.64s)]
*  The Halton District School Board and the Oakville Trafalgar School have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=26.48s)]
*  defended this guy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=29.36s)]
*  Now finally, some parents are considering legal action. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Rishi Bandhu is with the Bandhu law firm. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=33.72s)]
*  He's also a parent of a sixth, a ninth grader rather at Oakville. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=36.84s)]
*  He joins us to explain. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=39.32s)]
*  Sure appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=41.28s)]
*  Um, and thank you for having the bravery to make your position public. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=43.28s)]
*  What, what is your position about this shop teacher? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=47.56s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Tucker. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=51.2s)]
*  We really appreciate your interest in this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=52.64s)]
*  Well, what we've done is we've asked the board essentially to do three things. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Number one is we've asked them to apply the student dress code to the teachers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=59.28s)]
*  because one doesn't exist for the teachers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=63.88s)]
*  Um, and in our view, it's just illogical and absurd to suggest that, that the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=66.48s)]
*  teachers would be held to a lower standard than the, than the students in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  terms of, of their attire. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=73.4s)]
*  Secondly, once we've established what that standard is, if the school board is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=75.68s)]
*  creating exceptions from that standard, we want to know specifically what those [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  exceptions are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=85.72s)]
*  And then thirdly, uh, we would like the school board to cease and desist from [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=87.32s)]
*  interfering with the right of the parents to discuss this matter. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  And they've repeatedly done that in, uh, in school council meetings since [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=95.72s)]
*  the beginning of the year. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=99.28s)]
*  It just, what this reveals is their priorities and they seem much more [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=100.88s)]
*  concerned with protecting and affirming this guy's personal sexual journey than [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=104.56s)]
*  they are with your kids. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=108.56s)]
*  And it's a school, shouldn't they be primarily concerned with the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=109.96s)]
*  kids who go to the school? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=112.72s)]
*  Well, I do agree with that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=113.96s)]
*  And look, this is an issue about gender identity and expression and human rights [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=115.92s)]
*  by their nature are complex, but, but gender identity and expression are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=120.36s)]
*  relatively new grounds that have been introduced into the Ontario's code in, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=124.48s)]
*  in 2012. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=128.68s)]
*  So we don't have a lot of jurisprudence or direction from that, from our [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=129.56s)]
*  tribunal or the courts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=134.12s)]
*  And so I think what the board is doing is they've taken an overly risk averse [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=136.6s)]
*  approach to this issue. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=142.04s)]
*  And look, I can understand it and appreciate that they have a diversity and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=144.04s)]
*  inclusion mandate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=147.08s)]
*  And as a racialized person with racialized children in those schools, I [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=148.04s)]
*  commend that approach and I, and I appreciate that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=153.6s)]
*  However, what they're missing is that, is that when it comes to human rights and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=156.52s)]
*  particularly gender identity and expression, context is important. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  And there's a very delicate balancing of interests that have to happen here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=164.76s)]
*  And I don't think that they've done that appropriately. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=169.08s)]
*  And as you've pointed out, Tucker, I think the context that they're missing here is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=172.56s)]
*  that this is a school and these are children and their adolescents and their, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=176.68s)]
*  their maturity is still, is still developing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=180.4s)]
*  Now, on the other hand, I think, I think there's some extreme views taken of this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=183.36s)]
*  as well, which say that transgendered individuals don't have any rights on the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=186.44s)]
*  law. And the problem is, is that, is that that's an extreme view. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  And, and, and the parents that I represent and the parents that support them, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  are being labeled as discriminatory or, or bigoted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's the problem. It polarizes us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=202.52s)]
*  And what we need is, is a constructive approach, some constructive dialogue and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  some common sense on this issue. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, you're not going to get constructive dialogue if no dialogue is allowed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  If parents aren't allowed to talk. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  So I hope at the very least you win that battle and get freedom of speech back. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=217.12s)]
*  I think that's a prerequisite. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=221.68s)]
*  Rishi Bandu, I appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm hopeful that we will. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=224.96s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=226.44s)]
*  Appreciate you having me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=227.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwmV-5apQM&t=228.08s)]
