# Tucker Carlson: Shame on NBC News
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig)
*  What we saw in the body cam footage is both horrifying, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=0.0s)]
*  seeing poor Paul Pelosi in his 80s get hit with a hammer. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=3.12s)]
*  It's just absolutely awful. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=6.0s)]
*  But it's also weird, standing there with a drink. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  What was that? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=10.08s)]
*  We can't even speculate as to what that was. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=10.92s)]
*  And then the 911 call reveals above all [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=13.88s)]
*  that the 911 operator should be fired immediately. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=16.36s)]
*  Has there ever been a dumber 911 operator? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=20.04s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=22.28s)]
*  We can't have dumb 911 operators. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=23.12s)]
*  It really matters. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=25.04s)]
*  But above all, and we hate to defend NBC News, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=26.92s)]
*  but we just got to be honest, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=29.68s)]
*  the body cam footage completely vindicates [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=31.2s)]
*  reporting from NBC's Miguel Amaguar back in November. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=35.48s)]
*  Here's what he reported. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=40.72s)]
*  Sources familiar with what unfolded [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=43.16s)]
*  in the Pelosi residence now revealing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=45.12s)]
*  when officers responded to the high priority call, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=48.0s)]
*  they were seemingly unaware they'd been called [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  to the home of the Speaker of the House. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=53.64s)]
*  After a knock and announce, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=57.68s)]
*  The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=60.44s)]
*  or tried to leave his home, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=64.44s)]
*  but instead began walking several feet back into the foyer [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=66.28s)]
*  toward the assailant and away from police. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=70.16s)]
*  Why Pelosi didn't try to flee or tell responding officers [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=73.28s)]
*  he was in distress is unclear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  We still don't know exactly what unfolded [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=79.88s)]
*  between Mr. Pelosi and the suspect. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=81.88s)]
*  For the 30 minutes they were alone inside that house [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=84.0s)]
*  before police arrived. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=86.98s)]
*  So that's kind of amazing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=89.62s)]
*  I mean, the guy was just doing his job. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  He clearly talked to someone who saw the body cam footage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=93.26s)]
*  Now we can see the body cam footage [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=95.66s)]
*  and we know he was basically right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=96.9s)]
*  That's what it showed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=98.78s)]
*  So news organizations don't typically punish reporters [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=100.42s)]
*  for getting the story right, but NBC punished that guy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=102.76s)]
*  They suspended him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=105.94s)]
*  Then they deleted that report from their website. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=107.72s)]
*  We asked NBC today, why would they do that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=110.44s)]
*  But they did not respond. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Of course, we didn't know the answer, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  which is that body cam footage, whatever else it proves, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=115.9s)]
*  and once again, we're not exactly sure what it proves, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=118.9s)]
*  it definitely puts a crimp in their preferred story, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=121.5s)]
*  which was that the Pelosi household was invaded [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  by QAnon activists or something, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=128.32s)]
*  or this was some right-wing militia attack [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=130.32s)]
*  on the speaker of the house's husband. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=132.72s)]
*  That's not what it shows. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=135.58s)]
*  And that NBC reporter was honest enough [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=137.58s)]
*  just to kind of describe what it does show. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=140.1s)]
*  And for his efforts at telling the truth, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=143.28s)]
*  he was suspended. Shame on NBC News. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNFjA8Fmig&t=144.78s)]
