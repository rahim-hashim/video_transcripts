# Video journalist gives Tucker on-the-ground insight into the Ohio train derailment
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw)
*  Nick Sartor is a video journalist who is on the ground there in East Palestine, Ohio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=0.0s)]
*  He's spoken to business owners and residents of the town. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=4.68s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=7.08s)]
*  Nick, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=8.08s)]
*  Makes me feel bad we're not there, but we're glad that you are. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=11.28s)]
*  What's your assessment of the town right now? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=14.56s)]
*  So what's going on on the ground is a little bit different from what you might see in the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=18.52s)]
*  media. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=23.44s)]
*  The sentiment from the residents seems to be that they are super annoyed at how the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=24.68s)]
*  federal government, how the Biden administration in particular is handling this situation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=29.8s)]
*  You have the EPA in particular, they won't talk to any of the residents. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=34.96s)]
*  You have people that are right up there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I spoke with a small business owner that was their business was right in front of where [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=42.08s)]
*  the explosion was. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=49.04s)]
*  They can't get anything out of the EPA. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=50.36s)]
*  The federal government came in for a few days, took over their entire business, would not [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=52.48s)]
*  let them in, but also wouldn't talk to them and wouldn't give them a plan, wouldn't tell [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=56.72s)]
*  them anything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=62.08s)]
*  That's exactly how it's going for everybody that's in this town. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=63.08s)]
*  They don't know if they're going to be abandoned by the federal government and they don't know [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=67.0s)]
*  if their town is going to be wiped off the map. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=71.4s)]
*  It's really sad when you're talking to these people because they are terrified that this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=74.64s)]
*  town that they grew up in, that they've lived in for their entire lives is going to be completely [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=79.0s)]
*  demolished by people having to leave, people scared to even come back to the town. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=86.0s)]
*  There's a myriad of people that do not believe the EPA's assessment that the town is okay [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  to go back into. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=98.6s)]
*  So they just haven't bothered. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  And that is a really scary thing to think that the federal government cannot be trusted [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=102.12s)]
*  enough to be able to tell us whether or not it's safe to go in an area like this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=107.08s)]
*  Well, they forced the COVID vaccines on the country, so I think they can't be trusted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=112.08s)]
*  But I'm just interested as a factual matter, is the EPA tracking where this cloud of chemicals [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=116.24s)]
*  went? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was a local problem, it became a regional problem. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Do we have any information on the effects of those clouds of chemicals? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=127.0s)]
*  So Tucker, the EPA is not releasing a lot of the data that they've supposedly been collecting. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=133.48s)]
*  They were supposed to release data last week on water samples. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=140.32s)]
*  Was the water supply contaminated? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=146.12s)]
*  Was groundwater contaminated? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=148.92s)]
*  They have not done any of that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=150.68s)]
*  That's another thing that residents are complaining about a lot because they don't even know if [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=152.88s)]
*  they can trust their own tap water. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=157.0s)]
*  They don't want to turn on their taps. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=159.88s)]
*  A lot of these people do have wells, but they have no clue if their groundwater has been [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=161.2s)]
*  contaminated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=165.68s)]
*  It's just beyond belief. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=166.68s)]
*  This is America. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=169.48s)]
*  This is a first world country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=170.48s)]
*  I mean, yeah, or was. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=171.48s)]
*  Nick Sorter, I sure appreciate that report from the scene in East Palestine, Ohio. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=174.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTNm3vwvzw&t=179.07999999999998s)]
