# Kyle Rittenhouse has a message for Biden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 22, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY)
*  Red Nose doesn't seem eager to talk about it, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=0.0s)]
*  but he spent months in jail after turning himself [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=2.16s)]
*  into police, much of it in an adult lockup, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=4.96s)]
*  despite the fact he was a minor. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=8.16s)]
*  It was during that time that his family desperately, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=10.24s)]
*  his mother mostly desperately looked [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=12.32s)]
*  for legal counsel, for representation, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=14.36s)]
*  someone who can get out of jail. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=15.92s)]
*  In the end, the family was represented [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  by a pair of lawyers called Linwood and John Pierce. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=19.04s)]
*  This came up out of nowhere. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=23.54s)]
*  We were not expecting to have this conversation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=24.92s)]
*  We were taken by surprise a little bit, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=26.84s)]
*  but it's really interesting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=29.0s)]
*  Here's Kyle Rittenhouse's description [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=30.04s)]
*  of what his lawyers did to him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=31.8s)]
*  So you get arrested, what happens then? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=36.04s)]
*  Once I'm arrested, I go to Depke Juvenile Facility, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=38.24s)]
*  and I gotta say thank you to them [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=43.28s)]
*  for their professionalism. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=45.06s)]
*  The jailers? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=47.92s)]
*  The guards at Depke, they were the utmost [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=49.36s)]
*  professional people I've ever met. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=53.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=56.0s)]
*  Exactly, they were some of the most professional people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=57.6s)]
*  I've ever met. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=60.84s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  Like they treated me with respect, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=63.96s)]
*  and they didn't talk down to you like you've seen [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=65.92s)]
*  in some videos, they just treated me like I was a human. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=69.68s)]
*  How long were you there? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  I was in jail for 87 days, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=74.4s)]
*  and this goes as follows in with Linwood, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=76.44s)]
*  who Linwood was raising money on my behalf, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=79.92s)]
*  and he held me in jail for 87 days, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=85.24s)]
*  disrespected my wishes, put me on media interviews, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=88.48s)]
*  which I should never have done, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=92.44s)]
*  which he said, oh, you're gonna go talk [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=94.48s)]
*  to the Washington Post, which was not a good idea, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  along with John Pierce. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=98.84s)]
*  They said I was safer in jail [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=100.04s)]
*  instead of at home with my family. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=102.28s)]
*  And then after I'm bailed out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=104.44s)]
*  Your lawyer said that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  My lawyer said that, John Pierce and Linwood. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  87 days is a long time to be in jail. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=110.6s)]
*  It was very long. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  I lost a lot of weight in there since then gained it back. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=115.28s)]
*  I know the feeling. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=119.8s)]
*  But 87 days of not being with my family [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=121.84s)]
*  for defending myself and being taken advantage to, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=126.08s)]
*  being used for a cause by John Pierce and Linwood, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=129.88s)]
*  trying to raise money so they can take it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=134.96s)]
*  for their own benefit, not trying to set me free. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=139.32s)]
*  So you think they could have raised the money [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  for bail faster, but they didn't? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=146.64s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=150.72s)]
*  I believe sometime in September, September 5th, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=152.2s)]
*  I wanna say they had over a million dollars [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=154.88s)]
*  and bail was set and able to be posted in September. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=158.48s)]
*  So they could have had me sign the waiver for extradition [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=162.16s)]
*  and had me back in Wisconsin [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=165.2s)]
*  and I could have been bailed out by mid September, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=166.76s)]
*  but they wanted to keep me in jail until November 20th. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=170.2s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=174.64s)]
*  It was scary in jail. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  You had to watch over yourself [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=178.4s)]
*  and not a lot of people liked me in jail until they, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=180.2s)]
*  the funny thing is a lot of people didn't like me in jail, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=184.32s)]
*  but they got to hear my story and they got to understand me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=186.76s)]
*  He's actually a really decent person, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=190.8s)]
*  not this person that the media painted him out to be. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=193.56s)]
*  And it was scary, but I was able to make friends, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=197.52s)]
*  I'd say, acquaintance in jail [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  and like play spades card games with them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=203.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=206.8s)]
*  So you're in jail for 87 days. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=207.8s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how your case is being talked about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  in the outside world? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Not really when I'm in jail, but once I am bailed out, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=213.88s)]
*  John Pierce said I was in an unorganized militia, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  which is just blatantly false. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=219.8s)]
*  I didn't know what a militia was. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=221.88s)]
*  Wait, your lawyer said you were in a militia? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  John Pierce said that and it's blatantly false. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=225.8s)]
*  I didn't know what a militia was until after the fact, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=229.84s)]
*  until November 25th, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=234.12s)]
*  after I was watching some of the interviews he did, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  I was like, I am not in a militia, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  Sorry to laugh. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=244.52s)]
*  And I was like, what the heck? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=246.52s)]
*  And I'm like, no wonder people are saying I'm in a militia, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=249.44s)]
*  it's because he painted that narrative, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=252.68s)]
*  which he should never have gone there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=255.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's untrue. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=257.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=259.12s)]
*  Were you surprised to, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=261.04s)]
*  so I haven't heard you mention race at all [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=263.16s)]
*  in this conversation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=266.36s)]
*  You said you saw your community on fire, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=267.36s)]
*  you wanted to help, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=270.24s)]
*  you asked a business owner if you could help. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=271.56s)]
*  Were you surprised to see this framed as a racial story? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=274.44s)]
*  To be honest, Tucker, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  this case has nothing to do with race. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  It never had anything to do with race, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=284.72s)]
*  it had to do with the right to self-defense. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=286.56s)]
*  What a sweet kid. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=292.0s)]
*  I think that comes through loud and clear, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=293.0s)]
*  playing hearts in jail. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=295.2s)]
*  But he seems confused by the descriptions of this case [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  as pertaining somehow to race. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  What he didn't know when he was locked away for 87 days [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=305.68s)]
*  is that the media, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=308.2s)]
*  spurred on by democratic politicians like Joe Biden, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=309.04s)]
*  immediately branded him a white supremacist. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=311.24s)]
*  Again, the President of the United States did that, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=314.32s)]
*  so did several members of Congress. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Now during the trial, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=318.92s)]
*  one of the prosecutors, Thomas Binger, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=319.76s)]
*  particularly loathsome character, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=321.92s)]
*  the government lawyer, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=323.36s)]
*  mocked Kyle Rittenhouse for putting out fires in Kenosha. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=324.28s)]
*  It's dishonorable to put out fires, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=328.84s)]
*  apparently when BLM sets them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=330.52s)]
*  So we asked Kyle Rittenhouse about that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=332.44s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=333.76s)]
*  I'm not a racist person. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=337.36s)]
*  I support the BLM movement. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=338.68s)]
*  I support peacefully demonstrating. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=340.12s)]
*  And I believe there needs to be change. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=343.0s)]
*  I believe there's a lot of prosecutorial misconduct, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  not just in my case, but in other cases. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=348.4s)]
*  And it's just amazing to see [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=351.23999999999995s)]
*  how much a prosecutor can take advantage of somebody. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  Like if they did this to me, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  imagine what they could have done to a person of color [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=359.52s)]
*  who doesn't maybe have the resources I do, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  or is not widely published, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  and it's like my case. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  What did you make of the President of the United States [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=366.96s)]
*  calling you a white supremacist? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=368.76s)]
*  Mr. President, if I could say one thing to you, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=371.36s)]
*  I would urge you to go back and watch the trial [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=373.88s)]
*  and understand the facts before you make a statement. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  That's not a small thing to be called that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=381.48s)]
*  No, it's actual malice, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=383.56s)]
*  defaming my character for him to say something like that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, why do you think, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  and it's not simply Biden who said that, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=393.92s)]
*  it's a lot of people on television have said that, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=396.24s)]
*  dozens of people have said that, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=399.88s)]
*  I'm sorry to tell you in case you haven't seen it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=401.12s)]
*  It's actually quite hysterical [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=403.64s)]
*  how nobody can go back and look at the facts of the case. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=406.4s)]
*  He crossed eight lines, false. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  He's a white supremacist, false. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  None of that is true, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=415.2s)]
*  and the lies that they can just get away with spreading [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=417.0s)]
*  is just sickening, and it's a disgrace to this country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=420.0s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=425.79999999999995s)]
*  So before this, I mean, you're 17 years old, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  so you're probably not watching cable news all day [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  or deeply into politics, or maybe you were, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  but did you know how dishonest media coverage [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=435.56s)]
*  of events could be? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  I've never seen something so polarizing in my life [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=442.2s)]
*  when it's obvious self-defense. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  If you look at the case, you look at the facts, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  no matter what your opinion is or where you stand, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  this wasn't a political case. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=455.56s)]
*  It shouldn't have been a political case. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=457.36s)]
*  It was made a political case. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=459.6s)]
*  This had nothing to do with race, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=461.48s)]
*  and the ways people are twisting this is just sickening. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=464.16s)]
*  I think a lot of people watching [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=469.0s)]
*  have reached the same conclusion, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=470.36s)]
*  and they would like to see you help make this better [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=472.88s)]
*  by holding some of these liars to account. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=477.08s)]
*  Do you plan to do that? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=479.64s)]
*  I have really good lawyers [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=481.44s)]
*  who are taking care of that right now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=483.04s)]
*  So I'm hoping one day there will be accountability [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=486.2s)]
*  for their actions that they did. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=490.24s)]
*  Okay, so you're intent on not, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=491.84s)]
*  you're not gonna let that go? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=494.08s)]
*  Like I said, really good lawyers are handling that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=496.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=498.92s)]
*  So during the trial, was there ever a point [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=502.04s)]
*  where you thought, despite the fact [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=504.52s)]
*  you had all this video evidence on your side [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  bolstering your story, did you ever think, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=509.68s)]
*  I might go to jail for the rest of my life? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=511.8s)]
*  That was a thought I had every single day [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=514.16s)]
*  until I got the not guilty verdict. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=516.92s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=519.12s)]
*  It was, are you aware who JoEllen Demetrius is? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=519.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=525.16s)]
*  So JoEllen selected my jury, which she did an amazing job, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=526.6s)]
*  but you still have that feeling in your stomach and knots [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=530.8s)]
*  to where like, what if somebody snuck their way [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=534.68s)]
*  onto my jury to convict me? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=536.6s)]
*  So that was something that always went through my head, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  but I know where I stand and I know I defended myself. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=541.84s)]
*  Were you surprised by the verdict? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=545.08s)]
*  I wasn't, I thought they came to the correct verdict [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  because it wasn't Kyle Rittenhouse on trial in Wisconsin, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  it was the right to self-defense on trial. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  And if I was convicted, no one would ever be privileged [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=557.64s)]
*  to defend their life against attackers. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=565.0400000000001s)]
*  And thank God they came to the correct verdict [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=568.52s)]
*  and not guilty. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=570.5999999999999s)]
*  So the media lies about the police shooting of Jacob Blake. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=574.68s)]
*  A riot ensues, young people from throughout the area [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=579.52s)]
*  rushed to the riot to set things on fire. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse shows up to prevent things [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=585.4s)]
*  from being burned to the ground, to stop arson. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=587.68s)]
*  Guess whose side our leaders take? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=590.28s)]
*  They call him a white supremacist, they slander him. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=593.2399999999999s)]
*  Watching him speak, you realize just how disgusting [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  what they did to him is. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=599.84s)]
*  Just ahead, he describes the months that he spent in jail [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=601.96s)]
*  and the conditions there. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm7_wSuahXY&t=605.2800000000001s)]
