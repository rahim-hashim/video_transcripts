# PGA Tour fires golfers paid with Saudi funding
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4)
*  But we have one more piece of news about the live golf tour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=0.0s)]
*  Some of the golfers playing on it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=4.0s)]
*  are now taking legal action against the PGA Tour. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=5.16s)]
*  They've left the PGA, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=8.92s)]
*  and now they're being told they can never play in it again. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=10.44s)]
*  Fox's Bill Mlugin has been tracking the developments [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=12.68s)]
*  for us tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=15.18s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=16.2s)]
*  Hey Bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=17.04s)]
*  Hey Tucker, that's right. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=18.42s)]
*  Today, 11 members of the Saudi-backed live golf circuit [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=19.32s)]
*  all filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=23.04s)]
*  and they're accusing the tour [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  of illegally crushing competition, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  as well as retaliating against players. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=30.68s)]
*  So the PGA Tour has suspended golfers [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=32.16s)]
*  who were lured to live golf [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=34.64s)]
*  through some significant appearance fees, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=35.92s)]
*  as well as massive prize funds. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=38.28s)]
*  And the tour has pointed to its own bylaws [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=40.28s)]
*  that banned members from taking part in any other events [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  without the permission of the commissioner. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=46.16s)]
*  Effectively, what the tour is doing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=48.16s)]
*  is they're banishing tour players [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=50.4s)]
*  if they decide to take part in the live golf circuit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=52.24s)]
*  Now, Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=55.32s)]
*  are both part of the lawsuit. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  They are suing the PGA Tour [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=59.36s)]
*  all in an effort to challenge their suspensions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=61.28s)]
*  And part of that lawsuit reads in part, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=63.78s)]
*  "'The tour's conduct serves no purpose [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=66.16s)]
*  "'other than to harm players [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=68.48s)]
*  "'and foreclosed the entry [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=70.12s)]
*  "'of the first meaningful competitive threat [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=71.52s)]
*  "'the tour has faced in decades.'" [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=74.24s)]
*  Here's what live golfers in the lawsuit [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=76.4s)]
*  had to say about the tour this past weekend, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=78.16s)]
*  exclusively to your show. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=80.48s)]
*  I think it's unfortunate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=83.16s)]
*  that we couldn't try to bring this all together. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=84.12s)]
*  I think everybody would have benefited. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=86.38s)]
*  I'm not worried about what that tour does anymore. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=87.92s)]
*  They've separated themselves from us. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=90.2s)]
*  Everybody's, like I said, is against us [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=91.48s)]
*  and has basically treated us like [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=93.84s)]
*  the black cats of the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=96.84s)]
*  So PGA Tour is saying anyone who participates in live [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=98.0s)]
*  will be banned for life from PGA Tour. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=100.56s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make sense. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  You're 28, are you worried about that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=103.6s)]
*  No, no, I think it'll get figured out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=105.4s)]
*  And then I personally know that it will get figured out, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=107.32s)]
*  whether it's legally or whether they come to the table [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=109.44s)]
*  and work out terms. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  I definitely think it'll all wash itself out [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=113.24s)]
*  in the future pretty shortly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=115.32s)]
*  And Tucker, live golf and the mountain of money behind it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=118.8s)]
*  has really sent the sport [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=122.36s)]
*  into some pretty tumultuous times. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=123.92s)]
*  Live golf is offering $25 million in prize money [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=126.0s)]
*  at its tournaments. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=130.12s)]
*  That's a heck of a lot more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=130.96s)]
*  than the PGA Tour currently offers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=132.2s)]
*  And top pros are also being offered [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=134.2s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars as signup bonuses. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=136.76s)]
*  That's obviously a hard offer to not at least consider. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=139.96s)]
*  The PGA Tour may soon be forced to work with live golf though, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=143.2s)]
*  as the Justice Department is also investigating the PGA Tour [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=147.24s)]
*  over potential antitrust violations as well. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=150.28s)]
*  So the tension continues to increase. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=153.72s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't lose your force, thank you so much. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=158.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gbOoMfGD4&t=160.12s)]
