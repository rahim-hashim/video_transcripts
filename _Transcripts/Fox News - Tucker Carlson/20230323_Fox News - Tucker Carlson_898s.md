# Tucker: What is the science behind this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's enter fantasy land for a moment. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=2.5s)]
*  Let's pretend for a sec that our country had a news media [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=4.76s)]
*  that was interested in bringing you the news. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=7.58s)]
*  Not in lecturing you about your moral inferiority. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=10.26s)]
*  You're so bad. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=12.64s)]
*  Or lying to you in transparently obvious ways. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=14.16s)]
*  January 6th was an insurrection, guys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=17.72s)]
*  Or even enforcing you to repeat [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=20.48s)]
*  whatever childish slogans [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=21.78s)]
*  they've come up with this week. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=24.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=26.7s)]
*  Trans women are women. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=27.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=29.32s)]
*  Say it or else. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=30.16s)]
*  Let's imagine instead that we live [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=32.28s)]
*  somewhere completely different [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=33.64s)]
*  in a country where the media felt obligated [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=34.96s)]
*  to tell you what was actually happening in the world [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=36.94s)]
*  and why it matters. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=39.8s)]
*  What stories would we be talking about right now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  if we lived in that country? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=43.8s)]
*  Well, here are the first two. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Earlier this month, Iran and Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=47.2s)]
*  the two most significant powers in the Muslim world, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=49.6s)]
*  announced that after generations of proxy wars [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=52.44s)]
*  and snarling hostility to one another, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=55.28s)]
*  they will be resuming diplomatic relations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=57.52s)]
*  Peace has broken out between blood enemies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  As recently as last year, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  very few would have thought that could happen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=65.12s)]
*  And now it has happened. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=66.68s)]
*  And it's happened, and here's the significant thing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=68.08s)]
*  from an American perspective, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=70.36s)]
*  it's happened because China, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=72.22s)]
*  not the US State Department, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=73.84s)]
*  but the communist Chinese government brokered the deal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=75.08s)]
*  The world's largest atheist state [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=79.04s)]
*  has halted religious conflict between two theocracies. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=81.36s)]
*  Did you see that coming? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Probably not, but there's more. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=86.84s)]
*  Yesterday, China's President Xi turned up in Moscow [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=89.12s)]
*  to announce a new partnership with Russia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=92.08s)]
*  Going forward, Russia will supply much of China's oil [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=94.66s)]
*  and natural gas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=97.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin also agreed to use Chinese currency [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=98.44s)]
*  in trade with Asia, Africa, and Latin America. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=101.36s)]
*  Once again, holy smokes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  As with the Iran-Saudi summit, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=108.28s)]
*  very few people imagined anything like this could happen [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=109.98s)]
*  just 18 months ago. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=112.48s)]
*  Quote, change that hasn't happened in a hundred years, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=114.64s)]
*  Xi said, is coming, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  and we are driving this change together. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=119.36s)]
*  Now what change was Xi talking about? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, the end of American global hegemony, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=125.28s)]
*  the end of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=128.48s)]
*  For a hundred years, he got it right, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=131.72s)]
*  since the close of the First World War, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=133.32s)]
*  the United States has been the preeminent nation on earth. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=134.76s)]
*  For 40 of those years, we were locked in a cold war [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=137.84s)]
*  with the Soviet Union, of course, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=139.82s)]
*  but at no time, no matter what they may have claimed, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=141.4s)]
*  was there ever really a question [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=143.84s)]
*  about who was the most powerful country? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=145.84s)]
*  We were the most powerful country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  It was the American era. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=149.56s)]
*  That era just ended, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=151.28s)]
*  a little over two years into Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  But amazingly, no one in this country [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=155.84s)]
*  seems to notice that it happened. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  That story is not leading the news tonight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=158.72s)]
*  Instead, we're arguing about whether or not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  to arrest Donald Trump for a fake crime [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=162.44s)]
*  to keep him from running for president again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=164.8s)]
*  Over at the White House, our Senile president [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  just gave some sort of medal to a sitcom actress, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=169.46s)]
*  presumably for her bravery. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=172.26s)]
*  You read those scripts so boldly. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=173.82s)]
*  Sena is covering that story like it's the moonwalk. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=175.98s)]
*  On Twitter, meanwhile, people seem excited [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=178.7s)]
*  that our vice president has sent a letter [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=180.5s)]
*  to a transvestite TikTok star called Dylan Mulvaney, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  who is famous for dressing like a six-year-old girl. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=185.34s)]
*  Kamala Harris is very proud of him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=187.64s)]
*  That's the news we're getting. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=189.94s)]
*  It is Weimar, but dumber. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, the world beyond morning Joe [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=193.66s)]
*  is changing faster than at any time, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=195.66s)]
*  and well, as Chairman G correctly noted, about a hundred years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=197.62s)]
*  None of these changes will make life better [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=202.02s)]
*  for your grandchildren. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=204.18s)]
*  But since many Americans don't even know they're happening, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  the outcry here has been limited to a few insightful [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=207.84s)]
*  but deeply frustrated bloggers on social media. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  They see clearly what's happening. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  No one else seems to. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  It's driving them insane. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=215.28s)]
*  There are still people in this country, for example, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  who seem to believe that the so-called climate agenda [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=219.58s)]
*  is actually about the climate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  or about the environment of the earth or something, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=224.02s)]
*  and not a coordinated effort by the government of China [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=226.22s)]
*  to hobble the US and the West [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=229.18s)]
*  and take its place as the leader of the world, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  which of course is exactly what's going on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=233.38000000000002s)]
*  It's pretty obvious when you think about it, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=235.5s)]
*  but most people don't get a chance to think about it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  because the propaganda is just too thick. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=239.02s)]
*  It's unceasing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=241.34s)]
*  It never ends. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=242.18s)]
*  Here's the latest on the front page [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=243.5s)]
*  of papers around the country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  The head of the United Nations demanding the United States [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=246.34s)]
*  blow up its own economy, otherwise the world will end. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=248.74s)]
*  Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=252.9s)]
*  over the last 200 years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=256.02s)]
*  The rate of temperature rise in the last half century [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=258.6s)]
*  is the highest in 2000 years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=261.12s)]
*  Concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=264.24s)]
*  in at least 2 million years. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=267.52s)]
*  The climate time bomb is ticking. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=270.54s)]
*  So when someone who knows nothing about science, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=275.2s)]
*  whose job it is to act as a proxy, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=278.08s)]
*  a puppet of the Chinese government, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=281.16s)]
*  starts wagging his finger in your face, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=283.3s)]
*  claiming scientific expertise [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=285.44s)]
*  and telling you what to do with your economy, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=287.08s)]
*  at the very least you should pause for a moment. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=290.4s)]
*  And you should also remember that the United Nations [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=292.44s)]
*  has been saying pretty much the same thing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  since at least 1989. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  That's the year that the Associated Press reported that, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  and we're quoting, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=299.96s)]
*  a senior UN environmental official says, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=300.8s)]
*  entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  by rising sea levels if the global warming trend [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=305.56s)]
*  is not reversed by the year 2000. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  That was 34 years ago. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=311.24s)]
*  Happy to report we're still here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=312.24s)]
*  So has the science changed? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=314.12s)]
*  Well, apparently it has, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=315.48s)]
*  not that anyone will acknowledge that, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=317.04s)]
*  but the shouting remains exactly the same. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  And the AP doesn't seem to have archives it can check [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=322.56s)]
*  to find out, have we written the story before? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=325.0s)]
*  So they just keep writing the same story. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=327.0s)]
*  Two days ago, they wrote this, and we're quoting, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=328.62s)]
*  humanity still has a chance, close to the last, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=331.16s)]
*  to prevent the worst of climate change's future harms, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=334.36s)]
*  a top United Nations panel of scientists said Monday, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  but doing so requires quickly slashing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=341.0s)]
*  nearly two thirds of carbon pollution by 2035. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=343.44s)]
*  Okay, Associated Press. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  There's even a quote from the UN secretary general, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  again, not a scientist, a puppet of China, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  but pretty good at slogans, and we're quoting, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  humanity is on thin ice, and that ice is melting fast. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=360.08s)]
*  Are they publishing the same piece [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=365.23999999999995s)]
*  and just moving the dates around? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=366.64s)]
*  Not really, actually, because if you read it closely, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=369.12s)]
*  if you took a look at the UN's entire report, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=371.88s)]
*  and actually we spent the day doing that, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=373.6s)]
*  there are big differences in how they plan [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=375.84s)]
*  to solve global warming. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=378.4s)]
*  This time, the plan is much more explicit, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=380.56s)]
*  make the West, the United States primarily, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=383.36s)]
*  but also Western Europe, blow up its own economy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=385.6s)]
*  while China, the fastest growing economy in the world, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=389.36s)]
*  doesn't have to do anything. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=393.46s)]
*  And in fact, they're not doing anything. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=395.3s)]
*  China is currently building, well, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=396.48s)]
*  two new coal plants every week, every week. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=398.48s)]
*  Not good at math, but that's like 104 a year. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=402.68s)]
*  That's a lot of coal plants. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=406.56s)]
*  How many are we building a week? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=407.8s)]
*  Zero. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  Pretty weird for a country [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=409.92s)]
*  committed to fighting climate change. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=411.1s)]
*  Well, the report says that compared to Eastern Asia, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=413.44s)]
*  North American countries have a 33% greater obligation. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=415.76s)]
*  How do you measure obligation? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=420.1s)]
*  Is there a scientific scale for that? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=421.48s)]
*  But a greater obligation, 33% more, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=422.92s)]
*  to accelerate spending on, quote, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=425.36s)]
*  mitigation investment flows to, quote, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=427.16s)]
*  limit global warming. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=429.56s)]
*  Okay, the West has that obligation. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, if you were to go by like real numbers, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=434.04s)]
*  you might notice that China's carbon emissions today [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  are more than double our carbon emissions [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=439.2s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  So we're spewing less carbon, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=444.32s)]
*  they're spewing a lot more carbon, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  but we have to spend more [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=448.66s)]
*  because we have a moral obligation [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=450.68s)]
*  because why, that's not explained. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=452.16s)]
*  But later in the report, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=454.32s)]
*  the United Nations does say this, quote, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=455.42s)]
*  actions that prioritize equity, climate justice, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=457.36s)]
*  social justice, and inclusion [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=460.52s)]
*  lead to more sustainable outcomes, co-benefits, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=462.52s)]
*  reduced trade-offs, support transformative change, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=465.2s)]
*  and advanced climate resilient development. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=468.28s)]
*  Adaptation responses are immediately needed [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=470.96s)]
*  to reduce rising climate risks, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=473.14s)]
*  especially for the most vulnerable. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=475.0s)]
*  Equity, inclusion, and just transitions [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  are key to progress on adaptation [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=478.76s)]
*  and deep societal ambitions for accelerated migration. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=481.24s)]
*  Oh, that's science. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=484.54s)]
*  Try not to use a swear word on TV, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=487.48s)]
*  but I think we know what that is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=489.2s)]
*  It's BS. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=491.24s)]
*  The report continues, we need, quote, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=493.88s)]
*  meaningful participation and inclusive planning [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=495.72s)]
*  informed by cultural values and indigenous knowledge. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=498.24s)]
*  Indigenous knowledge. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=501.54s)]
*  Now, how much of that, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=502.68s)]
*  that's directly from the UN report, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=504.0s)]
*  how much of that sounded to you, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  probably not a credential scientist, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=507.62s)]
*  but a person with common sense, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=510.0s)]
*  how much of that sounded like science? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  All of it, says CNN, all of it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=512.92s)]
*  Humanity is on thin ice and that ice melting fast. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=517.04s)]
*  That warning, courtesy of the United Nations [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=519.64s)]
*  Secretary General, made in tandem [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=521.6s)]
*  with a brand new United Nations report [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=523.56s)]
*  labeling the planet a ticking time bomb. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=525.24s)]
*  It is worse than we ever thought it was gonna be, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=527.12s)]
*  and the time is ticking [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=529.24s)]
*  in order to diffuse this climate bomb. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  The climate time bomb is ticking, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=532.76s)]
*  that's according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=534.68s)]
*  on Climate Changes report. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=537.24s)]
*  There's no such thing as climate alarmism anymore. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=539.28s)]
*  The time bomb is ticking. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=542.4s)]
*  The new UN report warns the climate time bomb is ticking [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=543.6s)]
*  and the world is running out of time to avoid catastrophe. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=547.76s)]
*  There's no such thing as climate alarmism anymore. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=552.48s)]
*  Nothing you say can be too extreme, it doesn't matter. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=555.3199999999999s)]
*  That's science. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  For the Chinese, it's just so easy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  How do you win a war without fighting? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=562.64s)]
*  By getting your adversary to kill himself. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=565.56s)]
*  Well, how do you convince a strong, self-respecting, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=568.08s)]
*  powerful country like ours that has ruled the world [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  for a hundred years to do that? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=573.4000000000001s)]
*  Turns out it's pretty easy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=574.76s)]
*  You take a collection of dumb, desperate people [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=576.32s)]
*  in middle age, hoping to keep on to their stupid TV jobs. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=578.64s)]
*  You add scripts and some hairspray [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=582.84s)]
*  and they just repeat the lies for you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  And then all the people in the countries are nodding, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  yeah, that's exactly right, we gotta do that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=589.6s)]
*  Respect indigenous knowledge, stop driving our cars. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=591.46s)]
*  And the amazing thing is it's kind of working. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=595.1600000000001s)]
*  So what exactly is the science behind all this? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=598.08s)]
*  Well, on Substack, actual scientists now reside, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=602.86s)]
*  a political scientist called Roger Pilkey did a deep dive [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=605.88s)]
*  on where these people got the idea that the world will end [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=609.2s)]
*  if temperatures jump 1.5 degrees Celsius. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=612.6s)]
*  That's the globally accepted goal, according to the AP. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=617.82s)]
*  Well, it turns out that globally accepted goal [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=621.74s)]
*  originated in a newspaper advertisement [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=624.2s)]
*  and a draft paper that was not even peer reviewed. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=626.58s)]
*  Now it's in the Paris Climate Agreement. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=629.62s)]
*  That's the power of marketing. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=633.9000000000001s)]
*  But what's the point, of course? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=637.36s)]
*  What's the point of the marketing? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=639.22s)]
*  It's to destroy one civilization to be supplanted [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=640.82s)]
*  by the next civilization. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=644.4200000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're the one being destroyed [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=645.98s)]
*  or that is destroying itself. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=647.7s)]
*  And no one at the UN, by the way, cares about the data [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=649.26s)]
*  where it came from because the real goal [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=651.26s)]
*  has nothing to do with the environment, of course. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=652.7s)]
*  Duh, look at the pollution. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=655.02s)]
*  If you cared about the environment, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=657.42s)]
*  this is a tough time to live. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  But ever since Julian Huxley took over UNESCO [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=661.0s)]
*  in the 1940s, pushing Malthusianism, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=663.46s)]
*  the idea that the world's overpopulated [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=665.42s)]
*  has been the dominant way of thinking [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=666.98s)]
*  for the people in charge, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=668.78s)]
*  except with respect to their own families, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=670.18s)]
*  they have as many kids as they want, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=671.92s)]
*  but you're not allowed to. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=673.88s)]
*  And that leads to moments like the one we saw a month ago [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=675.22s)]
*  where the Harvard historian, Naomi Oreskes, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  wrote an op-ed in Scientific American [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=681.38s)]
*  entitled, Eight Billion People in the World as a Crisis, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=683.46s)]
*  Not an Achievement. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=686.86s)]
*  Well, if you're one of those eight billion, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  that seems like hostility. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=690.46s)]
*  If some chick is writing a piece in a science magazine [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  about how your existence is bad, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=694.82s)]
*  that might make you nervous, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=697.74s)]
*  It should. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=699.94s)]
*  And it may explain why these people oppose nuclear energy, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=701.4200000000001s)]
*  which seems like a solution, but they're against that too. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=705.12s)]
*  So it's not really about carbon emissions, is it? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=708.2s)]
*  It's about hurting people, specific people. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=711.1s)]
*  They think there are too many people. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=714.22s)]
*  And this view is very widespread. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=716.9s)]
*  It's why the leaders of the Democratic Party [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=718.66s)]
*  are always in your face telling you to get an abortion, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=720.02s)]
*  hurry up and get an abortion, it'll help the GDP. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=722.1s)]
*  Doesn't hurt, of course, that getting rid of fossil fuels [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=726.66s)]
*  would mean a lot of Democratic Party leaders [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  will get a lot richer. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=731.02s)]
*  Their donors certainly will, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=732.1800000000001s)]
*  the ones in the renewable industry. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=733.22s)]
*  It also means a ton of money for people [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=735.1s)]
*  with no skills at all, like Jen Granholm [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=736.74s)]
*  was now the energy secretary, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=738.86s)]
*  who owns stock in these green energy companies [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=740.58s)]
*  while she was in office. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=742.66s)]
*  It's also corrupt, it's unbelievable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=744.34s)]
*  And they're in your face, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=747.1s)]
*  they're just as sick as climate alarmism, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=747.94s)]
*  shut up and accept it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=749.26s)]
*  This would explain why Joe Biden campaigned [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=751.04s)]
*  on ending fossil fuels and bringing about [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=752.74s)]
*  economic devastation for millions of Americans back in 2020. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=754.42s)]
*  Would there be any place for fossil fuels, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=758.94s)]
*  including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=761.54s)]
*  No, we would work it out. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=765.98s)]
*  We would make sure it's eliminated [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=768.26s)]
*  and no more subsidies for either one of those, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=769.86s)]
*  either any fossil fuel. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=772.7s)]
*  No more subsidies for fossil fuel industry, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=774.1s)]
*  no more drilling on federal lands, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=776.18s)]
*  no more drilling, including offshore. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=777.96s)]
*  No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=780.54s)]
*  But I want you to look in my eyes. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=784.58s)]
*  I guarantee you, I guarantee you, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=787.26s)]
*  we're gonna end fossil fuel [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=790.3s)]
*  and I am not gonna cooperate with them, okay? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=791.86s)]
*  Imagine living under the rule of people like that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=794.1800000000001s)]
*  Imagine living in a system where we, with a straight face, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=798.7s)]
*  ask someone who's never had a real job in his entire life, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=801.08s)]
*  who has no idea where electricity comes from, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=803.7s)]
*  probably can't even change a light bulb at this point [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=806.22s)]
*  about our energy policy. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=808.5s)]
*  And then taking his answer seriously. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=810.98s)]
*  And what do you get when you do that? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=812.78s)]
*  And apparently we did 81 million votes he got, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=814.1800000000001s)]
*  more than Obama, really. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=816.78s)]
*  Shut up and accept it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=818.98s)]
*  Well, the result is now our strategic petroleum reserve, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=820.02s)]
*  maybe the most valuable thing [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=822.5s)]
*  the United States government owns, is depleted. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=823.42s)]
*  And Russia, which we say we hate, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=825.9399999999999s)]
*  is now once again one of the most important [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=827.88s)]
*  energy suppliers in the world. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=829.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, your energy prices went up [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=833.66s)]
*  at double the rate of inflation last year. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=835.26s)]
*  So why are we looking at here? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=838.14s)]
*  Well, there are people with economic agendas, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=841.36s)]
*  benefiting from solar panels and the wind farms [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=844.6999999999999s)]
*  that kill endangered species. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=847.0999999999999s)]
*  And there are the illiterate cultists in academia [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  who are just for this because they're for it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=852.22s)]
*  As if to prove that point, Greta Thunberg, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=855.46s)]
*  who just deleted her tweet from five years ago, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=857.1800000000001s)]
*  saying the world's gonna end in five years, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=858.7s)]
*  is about to get an honorary degree [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=860.94s)]
*  from the University of Helsinki. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=862.26s)]
*  This is a girl who made a living by not attending school. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=864.38s)]
*  So what's the degree in? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=866.7s)]
*  Well, it's not science, not climatology, it's theology. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=868.26s)]
*  But the real agenda, of course, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=872.22s)]
*  is much bigger than any of that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=873.8000000000001s)]
*  It's the great global reshuffling that is going on now, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=875.7s)]
*  beneath the notice to most Americans. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=880.1s)]
*  We're gonna wake up one day and realize [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=881.62s)]
*  we're not in charge, and this is part of the reason. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEw0NGH9fo&t=882.82s)]
