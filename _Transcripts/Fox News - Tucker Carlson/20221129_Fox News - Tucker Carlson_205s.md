# John Ratcliffe on China protests: No one knows how this will play out
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU)
*  John Ratcliffe joins us tonight with his reaction to what is happening in that country tonight. Mr. Ratcliffe, thank you so much for coming on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=0.0s)]
*  So it's hard to have perspective on this for most people including me when you see these videos [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=7.0s)]
*  How significant how serious are these protests potentially do you think? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=12.38s)]
*  Well, we've never seen protests like this in over 30 years in China [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  And it really will force the Chinese government to change their governance model ever since Tiananmen Square [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Tucker what the Chinese Communist Party has done. They said we're not going to let that happen again [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=28.36s)]
*  We're going to engage in the largest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=32.68s)]
*  Massive surveillance state in the history of the world against our own citizens and if we get even a whiff of discontent [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  We're going to stamp it out and they've been successful in doing that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=42.2s)]
*  this is the first time in 33 years that we've now seen nationwide protests and it's not just a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=47.16s)]
*  Problem or the challenge for Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party is it's moved from just a one issue [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=53.44s)]
*  COVID issue to now a call for his removal and for regime change [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=58.64s)]
*  So I don't think anyone knows exactly how this will play out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=62.92s)]
*  But it's very serious and very clearly the Chinese Communist Party is going to have to adopt a different [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=66.04s)]
*  Governance model going forward in light of what's happening there [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=71.88s)]
*  I don't think a day has passed in the last two years where the rest of us haven't gotten a lecture about quote [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=74.92s)]
*  democracy from the Biden administration [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=80.28s)]
*  Given their commitment to democracy. How can they not have a position on this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=82.76s)]
*  Well, the president's statement today was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=89.2s)]
*  Let's just be nice. It was it was late slow weak and cowardly. That's about the kindest thing you can say [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=92.44s)]
*  I mean, this is the same president who? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=99.1s)]
*  had an opportunity to confront the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=101.64s)]
*  Chinese president after three years and a million Americans were killed by a virus that originated in China and he didn't do it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=103.82s)]
*  So as disheartening as it is, it's not surprising [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=111.1s)]
*  And you know, I thought you and Laura really outlined, you know, what's happened here? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=114.5s)]
*  The silence from the left is deafening, you know as DNI I saw this type of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=118.94s)]
*  You know intelligence on a daily basis about how brutal the Chinese Communist Party could be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=123.06s)]
*  but on the left on the left what we've seen is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  You know some are silent because of greed. That's your Hollywood crowd your [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=131.82s)]
*  Wall Street crowd your NBA groups and organizations that want access to 1.4 billion Chinese and no matter what they do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=136.1s)]
*  It's not going to be enough to turn them away from that. But the other as Laura said are the group that's complicit [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=144.7s)]
*  That's your Washington politicians your blue state governors your dr. Anthony Fauci's your teachers union president Randy Weingarten [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  These are the people who can't condemn the Chinese Communist Party because to do so would be to condemn condemn themselves [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  They are the group that has praised and protected and defended and in some cases [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=163.06s)]
*  Emulated the same lockdown measures that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in right now and to condemn the Chinese Communist Party [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=167.86s)]
*  Would be to condemn themselves and to the emit the American people that they've been lying for three years and that they were wrong [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=174.46s)]
*  And I don't think we're gonna see that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=179.82s)]
*  Anyone who's awake at all can see exactly what's going on here [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=182.26s)]
*  And I think they're playing with fire. You can't you can't keep lying to this level forever [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=185.58s)]
*  I would say John Ratcliffe great to see you tonight. Thank you so much you too. Thanks Tucker [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkFy1jqa4qU&t=190.06s)]
