# Tucker: Under this new standard, we are in trouble
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=0.0s)]
*  Remember when political debates were the highlight of the political year? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=6.0s)]
*  Like boxing matches, everyone would watch them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=9.6s)]
*  It doesn't happen anymore. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=11.96s)]
*  The ratings for the last presidential debates were terrible and there's a reason for that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=12.96s)]
*  They're boring. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Everything is scripted. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  You know what they're going to say before they say it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  But if you keep watching the lower tier, the debates lower on the fight card, sometimes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=21.26s)]
*  you see something interesting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=27.0s)]
*  It happens invariably by accident, but it reveals a lot about the country and the people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=28.12s)]
*  who are trying to lead it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=32.92s)]
*  That just happened last month in Virginia during a governor's debate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=34.08s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe was the governor of Virginia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=38.88s)]
*  He gravely damaged the state. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=41.28s)]
*  He's the career Clinton operative, who you may remember from his many brushes with apparent [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=43.32s)]
*  indictment. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=49.24s)]
*  The Washington Post is always telling you he was about to get indicted. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=50.24s)]
*  He never was. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=52.16s)]
*  Instead, he ran Virginia and he ran it into the ground and now he wants to hurt it even [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=53.16s)]
*  more so he wants to be reelected. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=56.08s)]
*  And at the debate last month, Terry McAuliffe announced, just kind of welled up within him [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=58.02s)]
*  and he told us that parents no longer have a say in their own children's education, the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=62.7s)]
*  one that they pay for. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=68.62s)]
*  Instead, Terry McAuliffe informed the state of Virginia, the government is in charge of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=70.5s)]
*  your child, period. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=75.7s)]
*  I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=77.26s)]
*  You know, I get really tired of everybody running down teachers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=79.86s)]
*  I love our teachers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=83.9s)]
*  And what they have done through COVID, these are real heroes that deserve our respect. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=84.98s)]
*  Lisa hack, a liar and a demagogue, but ignore the second part of the sentence. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=90.54s)]
*  I don't think parents have any right telling teachers what to teach, really. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=93.78s)]
*  So parents don't control their own kids. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=99.4s)]
*  Do you have a right to tell the pediatrician what kind of medical treatment your kids should [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=101.14000000000001s)]
*  get? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  This is the new rule. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  The government makes all key decisions about your children. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  That's not just true in the state of Virginia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=112.18s)]
*  It is now orthodoxy throughout the entire Democratic Party. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  And as of yesterday, this idea, unprecedented in the history of America, has the full backing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=117.18s)]
*  of the Biden administration, in other words, of the entire federal government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  And if you disagree with that, if you're one of those troglodytes who thinks you should [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  have some say in what your children are taught in the schools that you pay for, you should [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=130.1s)]
*  know the Biden administration now views you as a domestic terrorist. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=134.46s)]
*  And they are fully willing to use armed agents of the state to compel you to shut up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=138.74s)]
*  Joe Biden's Justice Department has made that very, very clear. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland, remember the moderate, soft-spoken one who turned out [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=147.46s)]
*  to be not moderate at all, but a wild-eyed, radical, crazy person? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=150.86s)]
*  He's now the attorney general. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=153.86s)]
*  He issued a memorandum yesterday calling on the FBI to crack down on parents who complain [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=155.5s)]
*  about their school board. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=161.38s)]
*  Now keep in mind, at this exact moment that Garland wrote that, we learned that murders [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  in the United States since the advent of Black Lives Matter have gone up 30%. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=167.24s)]
*  So that's thousands more dead people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=171.52s)]
*  This is the attorney general, our chief law enforcement officer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  He did not issue a memo about that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  He issued instead a memo about people who are committing wrong-think. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=177.68s)]
*  Garland directed, quote, federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local law enforcement leaders [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  to discuss strategies for addressing this disturbing trend. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  This disturbing trend being parents complaining. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=190.56s)]
*  In the coming days, Garland wrote, the department will announce a series of measures designed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=193.04s)]
*  to address the rise in criminal conduct directed towards school personnel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  Criminal conduct? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=203.84s)]
*  What does that consist of? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=204.84s)]
*  Bombings? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=206.64s)]
*  Assaults? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=207.64s)]
*  No. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=208.64s)]
*  Complaining. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=209.64s)]
*  It is now criminal to disagree with your kid's school. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=210.64s)]
*  What have we learned from this? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, among other things we've learned, the Biden administration no longer believes in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  the most basic precepts of liberal democracy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=219.34s)]
*  Among them, your freedom of speech should never be abridged. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=222.66s)]
*  The government must convince you, not compel you, almost always. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=225.44s)]
*  And you, and not the government, is in charge of your children. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  Merrick Garland did not give birth to your kids. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=234.38s)]
*  They're yours, not his. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=236.56s)]
*  But they don't acknowledge that anymore. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=238.46s)]
*  So they're happy to use armed agents of the state to enforce their ideology. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=240.32s)]
*  And they have to, because that ideology is deeply unpopular with most Americans. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=245.16s)]
*  Now why did the DOJ issue this letter? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=250.44s)]
*  Well because they'd received a complaint from the National School Boards Association, huge [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  donors of course to the Democratic Party. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=258.84s)]
*  And that complaint cited citizens who were upset over the teachings of quote, critical [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  race theory and of masking of children, which is medically unnecessary. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=265.5s)]
*  So the group wrote to the Biden administration and said that some of the actions against [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  school boards quote, could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  Oh, so school administrators are now a protected group. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  If you disagree with them, you're committing a hate crime, not voicing an opinion, which [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  is constitutionally protected. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  No, it's an act of violence to disagree with them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=289.72s)]
*  Let's get specific. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=292.24s)]
*  According to the National School Boards Association, it's things like this quote, earlier this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=293.24s)]
*  month a student in Tennessee was mocked during a board meeting for advocating masks in schools [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  after testifying that his grandmother, who was an educator, died because of COVID-19. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  Now the association went on to say that the feds should use quote, the Patriot Act created [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=307.64s)]
*  after 9-11 to the regret of most thinking people and that postal inspectors should probe [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=312.2s)]
*  the quote, cyber bullying school board members claim they have faced. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  So where does this leave us? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=321.76s)]
*  Really simple. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=322.76s)]
*  Mocking someone who calls for medically unnecessary mask mandates is now domestic terrorism and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=324.52s)]
*  a chief concern of the FBI. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  What you're not allowed to do going forward because it's a hate crime is point out that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=333.88s)]
*  children and teens actually aren't dying from COVID. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=337.32s)]
*  They're dying from a lot of things, but not from COVID. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=341.04s)]
*  Take a look at this chart. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=344.64s)]
*  We're going to put it on the screen and it tells you everything. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=345.64s)]
*  It tells you that a lot of kids are dying of a lot of different things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=348.32s)]
*  Drowning as always is at the top of the list. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=350.92s)]
*  Car crashes too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  But you'll notice that more students are dying from suicide, in some cases directly traceable [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  to these policies, than are dying from COVID. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=359.56s)]
*  So that is a national crisis. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=362.6s)]
*  It's completely unaddressed by the Department of Justice or anyone else in our government. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=364.72s)]
*  All that's addressed are the ideological crimes, people disagreeing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=368.88s)]
*  Now for a long time, school boards have tried to shut up anyone who challenges their orthodoxy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  on COVID or anything else. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  In May in Loudoun County, Virginia, the newly radical Loudoun County, the school board used [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=380.92s)]
*  mask mandates as justification to silence a parent who complained they were indoctrinating [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  his child. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to read an excerpt from a freshman honors English class in Stonebridge. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=391.24s)]
*  She's a hoe, just like her sister. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  Every dude on the courts. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  It's time for LCPS to get their acts in their house in order. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=401.28s)]
*  The curtain has been pulled back and people can now see the deficient leadership that's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  been in this county. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=408.84s)]
*  My five-year-old is being peddled transgender books in her library. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=409.96s)]
*  Teenagers are being served pornography under the guise of young adult literature. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=414.2s)]
*  Do something! [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=418.52s)]
*  Be a leader! [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=420.04s)]
*  Because if you know what, the citizens of this county deserve better. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=422.32s)]
*  And if you're not willing to do it... [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=425.36s)]
*  Can you please cover your nose with your mask? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=427.48s)]
*  You're all vaccinated. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=429.56s)]
*  What the freak? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=430.56s)]
*  What the freak? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=431.56s)]
*  Give me 10 seconds back. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=432.56s)]
*  Give me 10 seconds back. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  Sir, you know the rules. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  I have 10 seconds to be stopped in the middle of my speech. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  10 seconds! [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  So they cut his mic. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=443.76s)]
*  You're violating COVID law! [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  No, they just didn't want to hear him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  That's a parent who's paying for the school whose five-year-old is in the care of these [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=448.04s)]
*  lunatics. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=452.44s)]
*  So they just cut his mic. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=453.44s)]
*  Now they've upped the ante. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  They can throw you in jail if you point out that what they're doing is hurting your children. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  By that standard, we're in trouble. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=462.56s)]
*  A whole lot more conduct is about to become criminal in the eyes of the Department of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  Justice. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=469.76s)]
*  Remember all those parents from school board meetings this summer? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=470.76s)]
*  Presumably Merrick Garland is going to investigate them too. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  In March, my child had to watch a TED Talk in English class, not on anything related [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=476.32s)]
*  to English, but rather oppression and acknowledging privilege. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=480.52s)]
*  Any parent with a pulse knows that this is wrong. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=484.24s)]
*  Why has public school become so mired in extremist politics and a permissive culture that seems [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=488.32s)]
*  to celebrate the latest popular fads like gender fluidity? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=494.7s)]
*  And we oppose your efforts to impose critical race theory, an overtly racist doctrine that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=498.92s)]
*  teaches our children to judge and categorize others based solely on the color of their [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=506.44s)]
*  skin. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=511.88s)]
*  Their job is to teach our kids math, science, biology, literature, and that's it, not ideology. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=512.88s)]
*  If I equally dislike all of you, you've all equally done a really bad job, and maybe it's [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  a good time to change something. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=527.36s)]
*  Maybe start right now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=529.96s)]
*  A lot of those you may have noticed are immigrant parents who moved here because of our famously [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=530.96s)]
*  good education system, only to find out that was a lie. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=536.08s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=539.24s)]
*  Now, for a lot of parents, the answer is going to be really simple in coming years. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=540.24s)]
*  Pull away. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=544.72s)]
*  Leave. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=545.72s)]
*  Home school. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=546.72s)]
*  Start your own school. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=547.72s)]
*  Parents won't put up with this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=548.72s)]
*  It's their children who are being hurt by it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=549.72s)]
*  On the other hand, you've got to ask yourself, why let the lunatics take control of a system [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=551.38s)]
*  they didn't build? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=555.76s)]
*  It's not theirs. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=557.36s)]
*  They don't get to wreck it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=558.36s)]
*  Maybe we should stay and fight and take back the schools, which belong to us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=559.36s)]
*  They're ours. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=563.6s)]
*  They don't belong to the teachers union or the National Association of School Boards, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=564.6s)]
*  much less Merrick Garland, whoever that is. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=567.2s)]
*  They belong to us, American citizens. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, the backdrop to all of this is the people you just saw are now designated as criminals [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=573.44s)]
*  by the Biden administration, by the Department of Justice, so-called. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  But at the very same time, criminality, actual criminality, actual violence, actual murders, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=583.12s)]
*  not metaphorical violence, hate crimes, but real violence, where people shoot each other [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=589.28s)]
*  and die, is rising dramatically faster than it ever has in American history. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=593.28s)]
*  What's the Biden administration doing about this? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=599.28s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=601.88s)]
*  Because a lot of these people are their voters. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=602.88s)]
*  They're political allies. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=604.96s)]
*  And speaking of political allies, the Biden administration has no problem when its political [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=605.96s)]
*  allies terrorize sitting U.S. senators in bathrooms. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=609.52s)]
*  It is not normal to harass someone in a ladies' room. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=639.52s)]
*  Period. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=646.28s)]
*  It's not acceptable. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=647.28s)]
*  Joe Biden has no problem with it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=648.28s)]
*  He said that yesterday. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=649.28s)]
*  But you should have a huge problem with it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=650.28s)]
*  This is the path to chaos and violence. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=651.68s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  But again, the DLJ has no problem with that whatsoever. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  They have a problem with you, the person who pays taxes, sends your child to public school. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=657.64s)]
*  They're telling you you have no right to be outraged when the school teaches your children [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=661.84s)]
*  that can change their gender at will and that white people are evil. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  There's not a problem at all. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=668.64s)]
*  The problem is you complaining about it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=669.76s)]
*  And if you do, the DLJ will target you like a domestic terrorist using the Patriot Act. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=671.28s)]
*  And yet, if you come to this country illegally, like the woman you just saw taking that video [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=676.84s)]
*  in the ladies' room, and harass a United States senator in the bathroom for not voting the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  way you think she should, you face no consequences at all. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=686.28s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just illegal aliens who get a pass on this stuff. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=689.72s)]
*  We told you actual crime is being ignored, yet is, at scale. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=693.92s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  Prosecutors in Chicago just rejected charges against five men involved in a shootout in [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  the middle of the morning. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=703.52s)]
*  The shootout killed one man and sent two others to the hospital. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=704.52s)]
*  But no big deal, because prosecutors in Chicago decided these were, quote, mutual combatants. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=707.52s)]
*  Huh? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  They're the gang members shooting each other. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not really our concern. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=715.04s)]
*  The guy died. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=716.04s)]
*  Last week, prosecutors in Chicago announced they wouldn't pursue murder charges because [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=718.3599999999999s)]
*  a teenager who was stabbed to death was, they said, engaging in, quote, mutual combat. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=721.3599999999999s)]
*  Again, it's totally fine. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=727.52s)]
*  Some kid got stabbed to death. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=729.44s)]
*  Not a big deal. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=730.96s)]
*  That's nothing like disagreeing with a school board. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=731.96s)]
*  And on some level, it's not. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  Gang members can shoot each other. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  They can stab children to death. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=739.08s)]
*  But that's not the same as challenging Joe Biden's authority to indoctrinate your children. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=740.36s)]
*  That's what they fear. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZscriarQJg&t=744.76s)]
