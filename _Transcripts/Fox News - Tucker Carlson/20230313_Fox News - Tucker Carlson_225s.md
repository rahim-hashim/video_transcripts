# Tucker speaks with animal control officer who rescued sheep from slaughterhouse
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI)
*  Here's a pretty great story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=0.0s)]
*  Not many of them. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=1.16s)]
*  We search high and low to find them. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=2.08s)]
*  So last month, people driving through Patterson, New Jersey [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=3.68s)]
*  noticed something weird. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=6.28s)]
*  Seven sheep were wandering around. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  They just escaped a slaughterhouse. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Police later rounded all the sheep up. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=12.52s)]
*  Sheep are not allowed to wander on the highway in Patterson. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=14.96s)]
*  And here's the happy ending. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=17.6s)]
*  These sheep are not going back to the slaughterhouse, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=18.68s)]
*  kind of like when the hangman's rope breaks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=20.8s)]
*  You're free. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=23.96s)]
*  So the sheep are now at the Skylands Animal Sanctuary [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=25.12s)]
*  in Sussex County, New Jersey. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=28.32s)]
*  John DeCando is an animal control officer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=30.32s)]
*  Mike Sturra is the founder of Skylands Sanctuary Animal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=32.8s)]
*  Rescue, and they join us tonight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=36.04s)]
*  Thank you guys so much for coming. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=40.0s)]
*  So officer, first to you, if you would, what did you see? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  What were these sheep doing when you apprehended them? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=44.72s)]
*  Tucker was around, maybe around 6 o'clock in the morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=48.36s)]
*  911 calls were coming in from the Patterson Police [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=51.96s)]
*  Department. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=54.44s)]
*  There were sheep running around in town. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  We got there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=58.8s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=59.6s)]
*  We had three sheep trapped in one place. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=61.12s)]
*  One sheep was down by Dunkin' Donuts, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=64.04s)]
*  and the other one was down by Stevie Mattress. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=65.84s)]
*  And it wasn't easy getting them because they [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=68.32s)]
*  weighed about 200 pounds each. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=70.12s)]
*  But once they escaped from the slaughterhouse, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=72.52s)]
*  they're not ever going back there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=74.92s)]
*  They're going to the sanctuary. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=76.32s)]
*  We end up getting two sheep. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  We put them back in two police cars, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=79.64s)]
*  and we escort them to the animal shelter. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=81.76s)]
*  And lights and sirens all the way up to the shelter, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=84.2s)]
*  and we came back, and we rescued the other ones. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=87.0s)]
*  And you had to see it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=90.0s)]
*  It was something, something unbelievable. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=91.68s)]
*  Well, if I could just really quickly single out [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=94.12s)]
*  the sheep at Dunkin' Donuts for a second, what did he order? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=97.52s)]
*  I think it was a, I don't know, probably cream light, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  one sugar, and probably a bagel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=105.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm thinking crawlers, but I'm not surprised. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Mike, you're a good man to take these sheep. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=110.0s)]
*  They're rescued. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=113.8s)]
*  What's their life going to look like now? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=115.4s)]
*  Well, Tucker, they, well, you're looking at it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=119.56s)]
*  They get, they, this is their, this is our sheep barn. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=122.36s)]
*  And they have a big field up here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  And they get to live their life out, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=128.28s)]
*  and hopefully, you know, pass away from old age, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  a long time from now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they do whatever they want. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=135.84s)]
*  Do they have any sense, do you think, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=137.56s)]
*  of how lucky they are comparing their lives [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=139.6s)]
*  to their compatriots back at the abattoir? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=141.72s)]
*  I mean, they're pretty fortunate sheep. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you, they're, they pay attention [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=147.92s)]
*  better than we think, you know? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  They've only been here a couple days, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=152.28s)]
*  and we just got the okay to let them in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=153.84s)]
*  with some of our other sheep here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=157.64s)]
*  And you can see already how much they've calmed down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=159.44s)]
*  They know that they're safe now, or at least, they, you know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=163.04s)]
*  It's the way the other sheep treat us, you know? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  The way they come right up to us and all that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=171.12s)]
*  These guys learn that from, you know, from them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=173.04s)]
*  Really quick, John, officer, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  for sheep watching this show tonight, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=178.44s)]
*  any sense of how these guys get out of the slaughterhouse? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=181.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know what happened, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=186.56s)]
*  but they probably opened up a truck, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=187.88s)]
*  and the guy wasn't watching what he was doing, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  and the sheep said probably now or never. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  And once I get them, they're going by mic, absolutely. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=194.68s)]
*  And you guys are so great. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=198.64s)]
*  You're making me proud to be American, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=201.08s)]
*  and it's such an important point. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlGco0t6lI&t=203.28s)]
