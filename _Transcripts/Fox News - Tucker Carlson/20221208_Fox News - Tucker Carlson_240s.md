# Tucker: Why are libraries scared of Kirk Cameron's book?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI)
*  So let's say you want to host a drag time story hour with seven-year-olds. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=0.0s)]
*  You obviously can use your public library for that, but you can't read a book about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=4.4s)]
*  God at a public library. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=8.86s)]
*  And the actor Kirk Cameron just learned that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=10.8s)]
*  Dozens of public libraries refused to give him a slot to speak to kids about his new [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=12.8s)]
*  faith-based book called As You Grow. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=16.92s)]
*  One Rhode Island library told him, quote, we are a very queer-friendly library. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=19.56s)]
*  Our messaging does not align. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=23.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Kirk Cameron joins us tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=26.96s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=27.96s)]
*  So they wouldn't let you read this book? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=30.8s)]
*  This book was banned in libraries? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=33.36s)]
*  How controversial is this book? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=35.68s)]
*  Well, it's a book that teaches biblical wisdom through the seasons of life to children and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  the value of growing the fruit of the spirit, like love, joy, kindness, patience, gentleness, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=46.92s)]
*  self-control. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=51.96s)]
*  And I wanted to do a book reading at a public library, and I was denied by over 50 woke [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=53.26s)]
*  libraries that have hosted drag queens' story hours. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=58.42s)]
*  One of the most outrageous denials was Alameda County Public Library that said they didn't [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  want that book teaching kids biblical values, while at the same time they're hosting a gender [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=68.3s)]
*  name change clinic tomorrow. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=74.6s)]
*  And I'm thinking, wow, if we're so committed to diversity, why am I being excluded? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=77.9s)]
*  Why can't I use your facility to read my book? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  You're a library. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=86.86000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  So we began the show with a story about how the president of Ukraine has banned a Christian [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  religion in Ukraine, and then we get to your story where the libraries ban your book. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=94.42s)]
*  So the thread here appears to be fear and hatred of Christianity. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think a religion based on peace and tolerance, turning the other cheek, not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=103.94s)]
*  showing vengeance, is so scary? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=108.14s)]
*  Well, my understanding of history is that the family and the church are two great pillars [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=111.14s)]
*  of Western civilization, and those two things need to be removed and taken out of the way [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=119.62s)]
*  in order to fundamentally change the power structure and the moral value code of the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  nation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=132.14s)]
*  And that's why parents are fighting back. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=133.3s)]
*  In fact, Tucker, hundreds of parents and librarians are now emailing us saying, we want your book [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  and we want to host our own Brave Books story hour in our public library. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=143.10000000000002s)]
*  So here's my call to action. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  I want every parent and every grandparent in America to get their favorite children's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  story book, my book or other Brave Books or a book of the Bible. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=153.74s)]
*  Call your local public library that has hosted a drag queen story hour and say, I'd like [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=158.02s)]
*  the chance to read my book in the library. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=162.52s)]
*  And if they say no, they're likely breaking the law and violating the Constitution. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=165.96s)]
*  And they can contact BraveBooks.com. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=172.24s)]
*  We'll give them free books and all that they need to turn that denial into a revival in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=174.96s)]
*  their community. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=180.34s)]
*  I think the posture that you're taking, which is gentle and calm and brave and persistent [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=181.88s)]
*  is something I personally can learn from. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=188.32s)]
*  Less outrage, more rational response. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think that really works. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  And I hope that you inspire other people to do the same. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=194.88s)]
*  Tell your story. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=197.68s)]
*  Don't get mad. Be honest. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=198.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=200.48s)]
*  Thank you. I think you're right, Tucker. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=202.84s)]
*  And to Christians particularly, we often get told no in the public square. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=204.72s)]
*  We go home with our tail between our legs, crying in our Chick-fil-A soup, waiting for the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=209.32s)]
*  rapture rather than getting on the offense and saying, let's invest in our children [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=213.48s)]
*  and teach them the values we want them to learn. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=218.04s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  And the way you're doing it is the way to do it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=223.56s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=225.56s)]
*  Kirk Cameron, thanks. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=226.56s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXCx6kKbKI&t=229.04s)]
