# Tucker: You should be worried about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, one upside of the very sad war in Ukraine [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=2.4s)]
*  is the national conversation underway in this country [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=5.66s)]
*  about freedom and democracy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=7.88s)]
*  Those are words on everyone's lips. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=10.32s)]
*  And so it set us off on a nationwide search [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=12.92s)]
*  for Americans who are living as if this were a free country, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  like it was say, 1989. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=19.28s)]
*  And one of the first people we found, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=22.0s)]
*  we have to tell you, is Kid Rock. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=23.04s)]
*  We spent the weekend with him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=24.48s)]
*  We've got an interview with him in just a moment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=25.46s)]
*  But first time, what exactly is democracy? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=28.86s)]
*  Well, pluralism is the hallmark of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=31.04s)]
*  In a democracy, citizens can have any opinion [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=33.96s)]
*  they wanna have. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=36.78s)]
*  They can express any opinion they want in public [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=37.62s)]
*  whenever they care to express it, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=40.18s)]
*  including through mass media. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=41.82s)]
*  If citizens are dissatisfied with their political leadership, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  they can challenge their leaders for office. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=46.44s)]
*  Now, all of these things are true in every free country [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=49.44s)]
*  in any period, always. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=52.96s)]
*  These are not just features of democracy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  These are prerequisites for democracy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=56.84s)]
*  So with that in mind, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=59.72s)]
*  you should know about a political party in Ukraine [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=60.56s)]
*  called Opposition Platform for Life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=62.34s)]
*  With 43 seats in parliament, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=64.44s)]
*  it is the largest opposition party in that country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=65.9s)]
*  Over the weekend, the president of Ukraine, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=69.24s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, banned that party. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=71.28s)]
*  Opposition Platform for Life has now prohibited [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  from quote, all activity within Ukraine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=76.08s)]
*  So with a single command, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=78.94s)]
*  Zelensky made it impossible for anybody [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=80.28s)]
*  to run against him for president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=82.16s)]
*  He did this not just to Opposition Platform for Life, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=84.5s)]
*  but to 10 other political parties [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  that he believed were insufficiently loyal to him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=88.94s)]
*  They're all illegal now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=91.54s)]
*  Obviously there's a war underway in Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  And on that basis, Zelensky has declared martial law. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=95.54s)]
*  But we must tell you, there is no evidence [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=98.76s)]
*  that the opposition parties he banned [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  Opposition Platform for Life, for example, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=105.14s)]
*  denounced the Russian invasion the moment it happened, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=107.06s)]
*  just like everybody else. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  But Zelensky took the opportunity to turn Ukraine [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  into effectively a one-party state, which it now is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=113.9s)]
*  So having banned all opposition, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=117.0s)]
*  he then seized control of the country's media outlets. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=118.56s)]
*  Zelensky signed a decree that combines [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=121.36s)]
*  all national television channels [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=123.28s)]
*  into a single platform that he controls. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=124.84s)]
*  He described this as a quote, unified information policy, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  and it certainly is unified. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=130.96s)]
*  So if all of these details seem shocking to you, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=133.36s)]
*  if this is not the Zelensky you've heard about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=135.62s)]
*  on the Today Show, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=137.44s)]
*  then you may not have been paying attention to Ukraine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=138.78s)]
*  Zelensky has been solidifying complete control [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=141.38000000000002s)]
*  over Ukraine for a long time, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=143.9s)]
*  since long before the Russian invasion and the war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=145.66000000000003s)]
*  Last year, he had his main political opponent arrested [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  and his assets seized by the state. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, Zelensky shut down [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=154.36s)]
*  three of Ukraine's most popular television networks, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=156.3s)]
*  channels that not coincidentally had criticized him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  So how should we as Americans assess this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=162.58s)]
*  Well, first and most obviously, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=165.9s)]
*  by admitting this is authoritarianism, it's not democracy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=166.94000000000003s)]
*  And then second, by acknowledging that actually [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=170.82s)]
*  it's pretty common around the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=172.82s)]
*  Even in 2022, real democracy is a rare thing anywhere. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=174.76s)]
*  Most countries are still governed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=178.4s)]
*  by some variety of dictatorship, whatever they may call it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=180.16s)]
*  And that includes close American allies. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  The kingdoms of Jordan and Saudi Arabia come to mind, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=184.98s)]
*  but there are others. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=187.2s)]
*  We're not moralizing about this, by the way. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, we'd prefer democracy everywhere, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=190.84s)]
*  in every country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=193.06s)]
*  But as Americans, it's probably a waste of time [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=194.34s)]
*  to get too involved in the internal affairs [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=196.64s)]
*  of other countries. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=198.64s)]
*  We're not going to change. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=199.61999999999998s)]
*  What we care about, what all Americans should care about [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  is what happens here in the United States. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  The United States is, despite the fact [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  it's also a bumper sticker, doesn't make it untrue, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=208.98s)]
*  is a beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=211.04s)]
*  How do we maintain that inspiring position? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=215.42s)]
*  Not simply by sending people missiles, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  but by remaining free ourselves. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=220.42s)]
*  The United States cannot be a beacon of freedom, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  of light in the world if we are not free. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=226.12s)]
*  So that's the first thing we do [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=230.0s)]
*  if we want to inspire and change the world. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine included, is make sure that we stay free. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=234.68s)]
*  And with that concern in mind, you should be very worried [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  by your leader's response to what's happening in Ukraine, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=242.2s)]
*  the growing dictatorship there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=245.0s)]
*  And that's the word for it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=246.38s)]
*  What's another word for it? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=247.34s)]
*  If you have ideas, send it to us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=249.12s)]
*  On the very same day that Zelensky shut down [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=251.1s)]
*  opposition media and all opposition political parties, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=253.92s)]
*  professional liar and Atlantic magazine pundit David Frum [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=256.78s)]
*  posted this on Twitter verbatim, quote, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=259.58s)]
*  Ukraine may be the first example in human history [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=261.94s)]
*  of a country that under the pressure of war [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=265.62s)]
*  is becoming more tolerant and more liberal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=268.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=272.14s)]
*  So when you outlaw all criticism of yourself, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  that's called tolerance, it's called democracy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=275.46s)]
*  Don't take the word of a single [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=278.94s)]
*  Canadian warmonger propagandist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=279.94s)]
*  David Frum is hardly alone in telling you that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=281.76s)]
*  All of Washington is telling you that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=285.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=287.6s)]
*  So proud of President Zelensky [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=288.92s)]
*  and the courage that he has shown. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=290.64s)]
*  And in Congress, we are trying to get [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=292.68s)]
*  the administration on board. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=295.16s)]
*  President Biden is showing moral leadership, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  just like President Zelensky is showing moral leadership. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=299.04s)]
*  He, of course, by his example, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=301.68s)]

*  People. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=325.62s)]

*  is actually the world's newest George Washington. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=329.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=332.38s)]

*  Because it's absurd. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=340.56s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the word from Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  a Republican. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=344.48s)]
*  And again, on one level, you can understand [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=345.72s)]
*  why people are whipped into an emotional frenzy [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=347.74s)]
*  when they talk about Ukraine. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  Why wouldn't they be? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=350.92s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine was shocking. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  It was wrong. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=354.0s)]
*  The suffering of civilians there is entirely real. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=355.32000000000005s)]
*  We're watching it on TV. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=358.6s)]
*  So it's entirely natural to root for the Ukrainians [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=360.06s)]
*  to expel the invaders. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=362.76s)]
*  And obviously we are rooting for them [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  to expel the invaders. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  Russia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=368.0s)]
*  But just because what Russia has done in Ukraine was wrong, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=368.88s)]
*  doesn't mean you have to lie about the Ukrainian government. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=372.88s)]
*  In fact, if you really cared about the Ukrainian people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  and all the people you just saw on TV, we care so much. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=380.04s)]
*  You wouldn't want them to live under a dictator. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=382.88s)]
*  So you'd be highly upset about what Zelensky just did. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=385.76s)]
*  But our leaders are not upset in the slightest. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=390.08s)]
*  They're cheering it on, even when they know better. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  So some of them are just too dumb to know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=394.6s)]
*  But some of them do know. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=396.36s)]
*  Michael McFaul, for example. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=397.46s)]
*  He's Barack Obama's ambassador to Russia. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=398.46s)]
*  Unlike shallow gas bags like Dick Durbin or Ben Sasse, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=400.46s)]
*  McFaul actually understands Eastern Europe. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=403.38s)]
*  He has lived there. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=405.3s)]
*  He knows exactly who Zelensky is and exactly what he's doing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=407.02s)]
*  So here's his assessment of the Ukrainian government, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=410.82s)]
*  not the people, the government, as of this afternoon. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=413.26s)]
*  Quote, if Zelensky remains in power, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=415.86s)]
*  Ukrainian democracy is preserved. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=418.5s)]
*  That guy teaches at Stanford. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=421.5s)]
*  But that's not even the case. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=424.74s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=426.8s)]
*  So again, Ukraine was invaded by its neighbors, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=429.0s)]
*  and we oppose that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=431.64s)]
*  We should oppose that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=432.8s)]
*  But that doesn't mean Ukraine is a democracy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=437.08s)]
*  And we shouldn't tell Americans it is, because that's a lie. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=438.04s)]
*  We should tell the truth. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=441.06s)]
*  But virtually no one is telling the truth. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=442.36s)]
*  Everyone is lying. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=444.44s)]
*  So why? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=445.48s)]
*  Why is everyone lying? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=446.32s)]
*  Why not just say, look, it's outrageous that Russia did this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=447.14s)]
*  and we're gonna, we like Ukraine better. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=449.72s)]
*  We're gonna support Ukraine. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=452.4s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=453.44s)]
*  Why go the extra step to tell us that Ukraine [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=454.68s)]
*  is a model democracy when it's not at all? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=457.62s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=461.5s)]
*  Maybe because Ukraine now has exactly the sort of democracy [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=463.42s)]
*  they'd like to see here in the United States. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=466.74s)]
*  They hate to think that could be true. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=469.42s)]
*  It's scary to think that's true. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  But ask yourself, play this word game. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=472.4s)]
*  If they could find a, quote, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=475.42s)]

*  do you think Adam Schiff and Kamala Harris [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  or Mitch McConnell would pause for even a second [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=482.64s)]
*  before banning their political opponents [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=486.0s)]
*  for running from office in this country? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=487.44s)]
*  Do you think they would hesitate [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=489.92s)]
*  before pulling this show off the air forever? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=490.92s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=493.86s)]
*  They do it in a flash. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=495.38s)]
*  Then they call it democracy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=496.76s)]
*  So maybe you're starting to conclude [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  that these people love Zelensky, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=500.52s)]
*  not because he represents the Ukrainian people, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=501.8s)]
*  but because Zelensky is exactly the leader [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=504.52s)]
*  they would like to be, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=506.72s)]

*  Maybe that's what's going on. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=515.66s)]
*  It seems kind of obvious when you think about it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=516.5s)]
*  Now, of course, we pray they never have the power [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=518.54s)]
*  to do any of that in this country, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=520.02s)]

*  We should not let them do that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=524.34s)]
*  because freedom in America is not just important to us, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=525.5799999999999s)]
*  our children and grandchildren. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  It's important to the globe. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=529.42s)]
*  Again, we are the last free country. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=531.06s)]
*  We must remain free. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oifqp1bJp8Y&t=533.98s)]
