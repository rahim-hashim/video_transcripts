# Where on earth is Governor Gavin Newsom?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw)
*  Well, here's quite a mystery. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=0.0s)]
*  The governor of the largest state in America has gone missing, not seen since he had his [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=1.56s)]
*  COVID-19 booster, probably totally unrelated. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=6.96s)]
*  Been about 12 days now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=10.08s)]
*  Fox's Bill Mollugian is on the case for us tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=12.0s)]
*  Hey, Bill. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=14.4s)]
*  Hey, Tucker. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=15.4s)]
*  Good evening to you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=16.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Look, California Governor Gavin Newsom has been MIA now for 11 straight days. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  He has made zero public appearances since late October, and really nobody knows, worries [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=21.84s)]
*  at or what he's been up to. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=26.84s)]
*  Take a look at this video right here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=28.64s)]
*  This was the very last time Newsom was seen in public back on October 27th. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=29.76s)]
*  You see him flexing there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=33.6s)]
*  This is right after he got his COVID-19 booster shot in Oakland at the time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=34.96s)]
*  He said it was painless. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=39.02s)]
*  He posed for the cameras, again, flexing in that t-shirt again, and he also urged others [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  to get their booster shots as well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=44.6s)]
*  Well, just a couple of days after that, on October 29th, Newsom's office very abruptly [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=46.64s)]
*  announced the governor was canceling a planned trip to participate in the United Nations [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=52.08s)]
*  climate summit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=56.88s)]
*  His office cited unspecified family obligations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=58.64s)]
*  Now Newsom's office went on to say the governor would attend that conference virtually, but [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=61.6s)]
*  to this day, he still has not appeared in that conference. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=66.2s)]
*  Now since then, Governor Newsom has only appeared in prerecorded video statements and in family [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=69.76s)]
*  Halloween photos. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=75.28s)]
*  You can see he posted the day after Halloween. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=76.4s)]
*  He showed an Instagram photo of his family, all of them dressed up as pirates. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=79.78s)]
*  And then on Sunday, yesterday, his wife posted this on Twitter. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=85.12s)]
*  Take a look at this tweet right here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=89.08s)]
*  She wrote, quote, it's funny how certain folks can't handle the truth. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=90.08s)]
*  When someone cancels something, maybe they're just in the office working. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=94.34s)]
*  Maybe in their free time, they're at home with their family at their kids' sports matches [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=98.28s)]
*  or dining out with their wife. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Please stop hating and get a life. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=104.68s)]
*  Well, she deleted that tweet just a few minutes after she posted it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=107.12s)]
*  In Tucker, Governor Newsom's office has refused to clarify to the media exactly what family [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=111.32s)]
*  obligations have been keeping him out of the public eye. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  However, his press secretary did confirm to Fox News late this afternoon that he will [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  resume public appearances sometime this week. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=123.41999999999999s)]
*  That spokesman also went on to say that his absence has had nothing to do whatsoever with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=126.58s)]
*  this COVID booster shot. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  Send it back to you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=132.72s)]
*  Bill Molluchin, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=133.72s)]
*  You too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTpTWgHTBw&t=138.35999999999999s)]
