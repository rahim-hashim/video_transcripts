# Hospital allows employees with natural immunity to defer COVID vaccine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w)
*  Several studies suggest that natural immunity, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=0.0s)]
*  the antibodies your body produces [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=2.32s)]
*  when you recover from COVID, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=3.92s)]
*  offer stronger protection than any of the Corona vaccines. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=5.08s)]
*  So why force vaccines on people who've recovered from COVID [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=7.98s)]
*  and have those antibodies? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Jerry is the Senior Vice President [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=13.8s)]
*  of Medical and Academic Affairs [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  at St. Luke's University Hospital, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=16.52s)]
*  which is allowing employees with natural impunity [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=18.0s)]
*  to defer taking the COVID shot for a year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=20.6s)]
*  He joins us to explain. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Jerry, thanks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=26.12s)]
*  I appreciate your coming on, doctor. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=26.96s)]
*  This seems like a sensible science-based solution. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=28.4s)]
*  Why isn't everyone doing it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=34.12s)]
*  But tell us, why are you doing this? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=35.16s)]
*  We're doing it because we're following the science. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=38.18s)]
*  It's important for us to state [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=40.36s)]
*  that we're absolutely committed to vaccination. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=42.0s)]
*  And we're also absolutely committed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=44.56s)]
*  to actually mandating it in healthcare. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=47.08s)]
*  It's very different in healthcare than other businesses. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=49.92s)]
*  But with that in mind, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=52.44s)]
*  those of us who make this decision, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  not only took into account what was going on nationally [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=55.92s)]
*  and internationally, like the Israeli study, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=59.24s)]
*  but more to the point, those of us who make that decision, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=61.72s)]
*  we're not doing this behind the desk or behind a computer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=65.44s)]
*  We're actually seeing patients. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=68.0s)]
*  And we knew that even once the Delta variant had hit, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  that it was very apparent to us [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=73.56s)]
*  that those individuals who had a verified natural infection [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=75.2s)]
*  were at least as protected, if not better protected, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=80.0s)]
*  than those who had gotten two shots of an mRNA vaccine [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=84.56s)]
*  or a single shot of the J&J vaccine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=87.56s)]
*  So we offered this deferment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=89.76s)]
*  And it is a deferment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=92.4s)]
*  We don't know how long it's going to last, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=93.48s)]
*  but as the data actually accumulates, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=95.68s)]
*  we'll change our policy in accordance with the science. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=98.28s)]
*  So you're using numbers science [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=101.06s)]
*  that's available to the CDC as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=103.56s)]
*  Why aren't they recommending the same? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=106.48s)]
*  Well, I can't speak for the CDC. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=109.68s)]
*  And in fact, we do support giving a single dose [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  of an mRNA vaccine after getting natural immunity, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  because we know that it increases your protection [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  by 10-fold. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=122.12s)]
*  The CDC, unfortunately, is still insisting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=123.28s)]
*  on two doses of an mRNA vaccine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=125.72s)]
*  And we don't think that that actually is supported [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=129.16s)]
*  by the science that we look at. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  And again, we're practicing doctors, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=133.56s)]
*  and we're able to interpret it that way. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that they have, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=139.48s)]
*  are they looking at different, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=141.6s)]
*  just for the non-scientists watching, including me, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=142.72s)]
*  do you think they have different data sets [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  that they're looking at? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=147.12s)]
*  Or are you looking at the same numbers? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  I think that we're all looking at different data sets. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  There is, we do not adhere to a bureaucracy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=153.6s)]
*  We've always been very adherent [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=157.04s)]
*  to collaboration and communication [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=158.88s)]
*  and making decisions very quickly based on [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=161.2s)]
*  what is proper for our patient population [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=163.72s)]
*  and for our staff and their families. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=166.48s)]
*  And that's what we've done so. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=169.18s)]
*  I think when you have government agencies, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=170.22s)]
*  it tends to work in a slower fashion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=172.62s)]
*  Yeah, apparently. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=175.1s)]
*  Dr. Jerry, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=176.7s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=177.94s)]
*  St. Luke's Hospital in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=178.78s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=179.62s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ1FyK6CQ9w&t=180.46s)]
