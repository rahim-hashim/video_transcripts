# Tucker: This is collective punishment
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ)
*  In the weeks before Joe Biden took office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a little over a year ago, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  federal officials met to decide [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=3.64s)]
*  how they were gonna distribute the new COVID vaccines. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=5.28s)]
*  If you'll think back, you'll remember that December of 2020 [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=8.0s)]
*  was the deadliest month to date in the COVID pandemic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=10.94s)]
*  More than 65,000 Americans had died that month. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=13.98s)]
*  People were very afraid of the virus then. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=17.52s)]
*  There was no treatment protocol for it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=19.56s)]
*  Vaccines seemed like the only hope. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=21.62s)]
*  So the meeting was very significant. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=24.2s)]
*  The CDC's chief medical officer, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=26.36s)]
*  a person called Kathleen Dooling, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=28.360000000000003s)]
*  unveiled her plan to distribute the vaccines nationally. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=30.5s)]
*  She began by acknowledging that older Americans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=34.36s)]
*  indeed faced the greatest risk, as everyone understood. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=36.6s)]
*  So logically, if you wanted to save [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=40.04s)]
*  as many Americans as possible from dying, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=41.74s)]
*  you would give preference, the very first shots, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  to people over 65. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=46.3s)]
*  That's the obvious policy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=47.88s)]
*  It might be the only morally defensible policy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=49.38s)]
*  But there was a problem with doing that, she explained. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=52.14s)]
*  Older Americans were too white. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=54.88s)]
*  As Dooling put it, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=57.34s)]
*  quote, racial and ethnic minority groups [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=58.54s)]
*  are underrepresented among adults age 65 and older. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=60.14s)]
*  And this meant, according to Dooling, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=64.58s)]
*  they could not be allowed to get the first COVID shots, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=66.42s)]
*  whether they needed them or not. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=69.92s)]
*  So instead, Dooling recommended giving priority [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=72.32s)]
*  to a group the government started calling essential workers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=74.36s)]
*  Their main qualification was not that they were essential, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=77.2s)]
*  but they were less white than old people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=79.6s)]
*  So that's what the CDC went with. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=82.2s)]
*  Its panel overwhelmingly approved [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=83.8s)]
*  Kathleen Dooling's recommendation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=85.96s)]
*  None of this got a lot of notice at the time, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=88.2s)]
*  but it was a major change. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=90.96s)]
*  Never in American history, modern history in any case, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=93.16s)]
*  has the federal government made it official policy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=96.48s)]
*  to withhold life-saving medical treatment from Americans [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=98.9s)]
*  on the basis of their skin color. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=102.34s)]
*  But that's exactly what the CDC did. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=104.52s)]
*  Those most likely to die of COVID [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=107.12s)]
*  had to wait weeks until their vaccines were approved. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=109.12s)]
*  How many of them died in the meantime as they waited? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=112.52s)]
*  No one kept track of those numbers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  because nobody seemed to care. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=117.22s)]
*  And because nobody cared, the trend continued. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  Race had become a deciding factor [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=122.22s)]
*  in the distribution of critical healthcare in this country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=124.56s)]
*  Several states made it explicit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=127.66s)]
*  Whites would go last in the COVID vaccine queue, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=129.5s)]
*  regardless of need. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=132.0s)]
*  The state of Vermont did this, so did the state of Montana. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=133.6s)]
*  And then the moment he was declared president-elect, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=136.54s)]
*  Joe Biden made it official. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=138.64s)]
*  A concept called equity, a kind of hyper-aggressive, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=140.72s)]
*  racially hostile affirmative action, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=143.96s)]
*  would form the basis of everything [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=146.1s)]
*  the new administration did, beginning with COVID policy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=148.34s)]
*  Here's Biden before even being sworn in last year. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=151.8s)]
*  I want to be very clear what my priorities are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=154.6s)]
*  for distributing this emergency aid swiftly and equitably. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=158.06s)]
*  Our focus will be on small businesses on Main Street [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=162.12s)]
*  that aren't wealthy and well-connected, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=165.76s)]
*  that are facing real economic hardships [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=168.18s)]
*  through no fault of their own. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=170.26s)]
*  Our priority will be black, Latino, Asian, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=172.18s)]
*  and Native American-owned small businesses, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=174.22000000000003s)]
*  women-owned businesses. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=176.08s)]
*  So you'll notice the assumption in that sentence, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=178.56s)]
*  which undergirds all the assumptions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=181.46s)]
*  behind the administration's equity policy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=183.36s)]
*  And that is that non-white means poor [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  and non-white means less healthy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=189.66000000000003s)]
*  As a factual matter, that's certainly not true [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=192.44000000000003s)]
*  across the board. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=194.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not even close to true. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=195.38000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the highest income groups in this country [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=196.78000000000003s)]
*  are not white. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  But they've run with it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  But they've run with it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=201.24s)]
*  And he made good on that promise. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=202.48s)]
*  In its first year, the Biden administration [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=204.44s)]
*  awarded billions of dollars in COVID relief, for example, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=206.34s)]
*  to black farmers purely on the basis of their skin color. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=209.18s)]
*  Race was the only criterion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=211.62s)]
*  Now, doing that was illegal, obviously. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=213.42s)]
*  It violated all kinds of federal laws, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  and the federal court soon struck it down. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=217.92s)]
*  But the White House didn't stop. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=220.06s)]
*  They accelerated, and they applied that same standard [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=221.36s)]
*  to everything, very much including [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=223.96s)]
*  the allocation of healthcare. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=226.14s)]
*  Healthcare for all, that was the slogan for generations. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  The new slogan under the Biden administration [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=230.94s)]
*  was healthcare for favored groups. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=233.38s)]
*  And those policies continue tonight. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  They're illegal, they're immoral, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  and yet they are all but ignored by the media [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=239.38s)]
*  and, by the way, by Republican lawmakers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=241.46s)]
*  Several weeks ago, for example, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=244.46s)]
*  the Food and Drug Administration released a fact sheet [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=245.66s)]
*  on a monoclonal antibody called Sotrovimab. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=248.06s)]
*  Sotrovimab is at this point [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=250.96s)]
*  the only monoclonal antibody treatment [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=252.36s)]
*  that has proven effective against the latest variant [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  of the coronavirus. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=256.98s)]
*  The FDA provided guidance for physicians in all 50 states, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=258.6s)]
*  telling them how to determine [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=261.68s)]
*  which patients should get this treatment, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=263.16s)]
*  this critical treatment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  Physicians, the FDA explained, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=266.86s)]
*  should consider, quote, race and ethnicity [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=268.44s)]
*  as they administer treatments. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=271.16s)]
*  And so physicians are doing that across the country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=272.48s)]
*  In Utah, COVID patients are triaged by a scoring system [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  that determines whether or not they qualify [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=278.92s)]
*  for these potentially life-saving antibody treatments. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Look at this chart. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=283.6s)]
*  It shows the scoring system. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=284.44s)]
*  You'll notice that race often counts more [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=286.14s)]
*  than physical health. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=288.44s)]
*  The state of Utah, for example, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=290.28s)]
*  gives two points to anyone simply for not being white. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  You win if you're not white. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=294.78s)]
*  If you have congestive heart failure at the same time, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  you get one point. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=299.2s)]
*  So if you're a white congestive heart failure patient, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=300.8s)]
*  that's not enough for you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=303.4s)]
*  It's the same story in Minnesota. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=305.0s)]
*  Minnesota awards two points to so-called BIPOC patients. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=306.76s)]
*  That means anyone who's not white. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ywWgNEYuQ&t=310.21999999999997s)]
