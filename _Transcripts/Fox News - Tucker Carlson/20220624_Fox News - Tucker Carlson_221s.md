# Missouri becomes the first state to ban abortion: AG Eric Schmitt
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc)
*  So as he said a minute ago, this is not a surprise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=0.0s)]
*  The law, and that matters because it's the Supreme Court we're talking about, the law [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=3.36s)]
*  behind the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 was so shoddy and ridiculous, because of course abortion [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=7.36s)]
*  is not mentioned in the Constitution, not even alluded to, that a lot of people figured out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=13.52s)]
*  a long time ago that it would at some point be overturned because it was too absurd to continue. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=18.72s)]
*  And so a lot of states have been preparing for it. More than a dozen of them have what are called [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=23.76s)]
*  trigger laws that will take effect now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=27.68s)]
*  And a lot of them will outlaw most abortion. So eventually roughly half the country is expected [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=32.0s)]
*  to implement significant new restrictions on abortion. And that matches public opinion polling [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=37.28s)]
*  on abortion, which is to say a lot of people don't like abortion. If you live in New York City, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  you might not know any of them. But if you live in Mississippi, you know quite a few. The point is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  people will get to live with the laws they want. How's that bad? Today the state of Missouri became [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=52.8s)]
*  the very first state to ban abortion. The state's attorney general is Eric Schmidt, and we're happy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=59.04s)]
*  to have him join us tonight. Mr. General, thanks so much for coming on. So what is the state of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=62.8s)]
*  abortion law in Missouri now? Yeah, Missouri became the first state after the decision, the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=67.84s)]
*  Dobs decision day to effectively end abortion. And this is something that's been worked on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=73.28s)]
*  for decades. People have prayed upon this. It's a long time coming. Thankfully, President Trump [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=77.44s)]
*  appointed three conservative justices that knew that the Roe decision, as Justice Alito said, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=82.08s)]
*  the day it was issued was on a collision course with the Constitution. And we see that here today [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=86.88s)]
*  now. And so this issue will be decided as it should have been 49 years ago to the states. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=91.92s)]
*  Missouri, interestingly, in 1825 was the first state to formally prohibit abortion. That was [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=96.88s)]
*  the law of our state until Roe v. Wade. And now we're back to where it should have always been. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=102.08s)]
*  And so it's a big day. And I think, as you've pointed out, it's a big day for democracy, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=107.12s)]
*  for the voters now to have a say, as opposed to nine justices, unelected justices back [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=112.0s)]
*  49 years ago that decided this for everybody in the country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=116.96s)]
*  And I think what you're seeing now with this night of rage that's been talked about, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=120.64s)]
*  the Justice Department has no interest in condemning it. They haven't done anything to stop it. You've [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=125.28s)]
*  seen an assassination attempt of a Supreme Court justice. You see this intimidation that's going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=130.64s)]
*  to continue. The Justice Department's way more interested, evidently, in sickening the FBI and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=135.92s)]
*  going after parents who show up to school board meetings under the Patriot Act than arresting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  folks who are intimidating Supreme Court justices. This is out of a banana Third World Republic. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=146.16s)]
*  But thankfully, the rule of law was buttressed today, and Missouri was the first state to take [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  action. I was proud to do that as the state's chief legal officer. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm glad this is back in the political arena where it belongs, where voters can decide. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=160.72s)]
*  And one effect is people are going to have to start affirmatively defending abortion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=167.2s)]
*  and not hiding behind these stupid slogans and euphemisms. Oh, it's choice. It's a health [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=171.44s)]
*  care procedure. It's a human right. Really? Well, what is it? And why don't you tell us why you're [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=177.04s)]
*  for it? You look forward to that conversation? Absolutely. And that's where it should have been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=180.64s)]
*  all along, Tucker. And so here we are now, 49 years later with the reset and the people get to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=185.04s)]
*  weigh in. It's what was always intended as opposed to Roe v. Wade, which was made out of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=189.92s)]
*  a constitutional right made out of whole cloth. Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, they hate democracy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=194.48s)]
*  like the devil hates holy water. It is just amazing to see it. Eric Schmidt, state of Missouri. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWetCiBeCmc&t=202.0s)]
