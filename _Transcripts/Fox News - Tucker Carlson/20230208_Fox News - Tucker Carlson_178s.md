# Glenn Greenwald tells Tucker this story was too revealing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs)
*  So the now disgraced and criminally charged crypto exchange FTX has just sent out letters to politicians who they sent money to saying, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=0.0s)]
*  hey, can you return the money we sent you because a million people got defrauded, maybe they should have some of the money. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=7.88s)]
*  It's not clear if that's ever going to happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=15.52s)]
*  It's also not clear if any of the many media outlets that took ill gotten gains from FTX, like the left wing blog Semaphore, will ever pay that money back. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, this is the biggest financial scandal probably in history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=26.84s)]
*  Joe Biden is expected to ignore it completely tonight, even though the Democratic Party was the main political beneficiary of the money from FTX. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald is a journalist working on Substack, finds the story interesting and joins us tonight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=46.08s)]
*  It's a little weird, like the cynical among us when the FTX story broke said to one another, this will be out of the news in a week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  And actually it was. Does that shock you? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=54.96s)]
*  Yes and no. I mean, it would be like, you know, if Bernie Madoff was found to be with his tentacles in a bunch of political offices, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=59.92s)]
*  you would think that would be a story that would go on for a long time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=67.36s)]
*  I think the reason why they wanted to get rid of this is it's too revealing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=70.6s)]
*  You know, I remember the time that Trump boasted the fact that he could, before being president, get anyone on the phone in Washington by just offering them up a check and they would do whatever he asked for. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=74.04s)]
*  That, of course, is how DC works. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=82.2s)]
*  And this shows it. There are politicians who are very liberal, who usually would be in favor of regulating a new currency, a cryptocurrency, who suddenly got adamant that the government should stay out of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=83.84s)]
*  It turns out they were getting big money from FTX. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  There are, you know, he said in an interview Sam McBain-Free did that he purposely touted his donations to Democrats and hid the ones he made to Republicans, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  because the only way to be popular among the media is by having them think that you're donating to Democrats. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  If they donate to Republicans, they hate you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=114.04s)]
*  So there's so much going on here that reveals a little bit too bright of a light on how Washington really works. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  And I wonder if is there any hope you spent so many years in the media that somebody, well-funded news organization, will just get to the bottom of it, write a clear series on what happened ever? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=122.64s)]
*  The problem is that he was buying out media outlets as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=136.04s)]
*  I mean, so many of them were recipients of huge amounts of money. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=138.88s)]
*  The Intercept, where I used to work, I founded it and then quit, got huge grant from him and to this day refuses to return it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  And everyone knows, including these politicians, it's not their money. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  That money was stolen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  It was a Ponzi scheme. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  And people are out without their money while these media outlets and politicians keep the money that doesn't belong to them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=154.44s)]
*  It's really unbelievable. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=160.76s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, thank you for that perspective. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=163.64s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkRVfziQgs&t=165.72s)]
