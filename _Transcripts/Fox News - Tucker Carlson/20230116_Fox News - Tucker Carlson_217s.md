# ‘The Chicken Lady’ joins Tucker to talk skyrocketing egg prices
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs)
*  So we saw this story and we thought who can we consult about the price of eggs in the first name that came to mind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=0.0s)]
*  Was tiara solemn a chicken enthusiast a longtime chicken expert working informally for this show and someone whose life has been vindicated [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=5.96s)]
*  By the current news tiara. Thank you so much for coming on tonight. So you have been keeping chickens [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=14.08s)]
*  Famously for years now now there is an egg shortage. You must feel like the smartest person in America [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  You know, I will say my heart goes out to all the chickens that lost their lives to this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=26.16s)]
*  Yes, horrendous bird flu that's going on but for like local chicken owners and like small farms [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=32.32s)]
*  This is great for us because now people are turning to us wanting our eggs and finally respecting chickens [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=40.08s)]
*  Like they deserve [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=47.44s)]
*  Well, so that must feel really good because I know you've been on the show a number of times [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=49.84s)]
*  We've always been grateful to have you and we've gotten a big response every time and most has been positive [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=53.36s)]
*  Some of it has been mocking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=57.44s)]
*  I'm sure that you have been mocked by your family friends and neighbors for keeping so many chickens for being a chicken enthusiast [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=59.2s)]
*  They're not making fun of you anymore. Are they? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=64.48s)]
*  No, they're actually coming to me and wanting my eggs and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=68.24s)]
*  finally [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=72.72s)]
*  Needing me for something and i'm like, oh it's about time. You're welcome [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=74.16s)]
*  Yes, and do they look at the chickens a little differently [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=78.72s)]
*  You know, I feel like at this point yes [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=83.28s)]
*  Oh dear [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=87.12s)]
*  So so really I mean the the the two themes i'm taking away from your life [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=88.8s)]
*  Are self-sufficiency and love of animals [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=96.0s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=99.68s)]
*  You know, yeah, because finally [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  After the years of people making fun of my chickens and thinking that i'm weird that I have so many roosters and so many hens [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Yes, i'm now like, oh told you so chickens are finally having their glow up and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=109.28s)]
*  I'm so grateful for it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  Now but we we should just say in the interest of animal husbandry and accuracy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  I'm so grateful for it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=122.0s)]
*  I'm so grateful for it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  Now but we we should just say in the interest of animal husbandry and accuracy roosters don't lay eggs, correct [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=127.6s)]
*  No, so [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=136.16s)]
*  Funny thing is my hens sleep in a different coop. And so right now we're in front of all my roosters [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=137.76s)]
*  So a lot of people will probably be like, oh my gosh roosters don't lay eggs [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=143.04s)]
*  No [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=147.2s)]
*  But this is easier. And if you remember last time there's bad boy halo from the very very first time I was on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=148.24s)]
*  He's uh right there in the center. He was a little star [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=155.12s)]
*  Yeah, he does his job. Well [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=159.52s)]
*  Can I just ask you not to get too in the weeds on the chicken question, but how do you keep the roosters from killing each other? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=162.72s)]
*  Okay, so i'm a full believer in roosters are misunderstood and if you raise them hand raise them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=170.4s)]
*  Hold them handle them. They actually are all very nice. So my six [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Roosters coexists really well with my other six hens [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=182.16s)]
*  So I think it's all the way you raise them [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=186.4s)]
*  That's fair. I you know, I actually consulted someone with chickens after your last appearance. Um, and I we both agreed you are the chicken whisperer [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=189.52s)]
*  Um tier thank you so much for joining us and congratulations on your vindication [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=196.96s)]
*  and uh, good luck with all those eggs [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoAhg_7oDs&t=201.28s)]
