# Gov. Kristi Noem: This is a threat to our freedom
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg)
*  So the drama in the banking sector, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, has a lot of Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=0.0s)]
*  concerned about how to protect their money. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And of course, politicians are using that concern to their advantage as always. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=8.08s)]
*  Several states are now trying to centralize currency with the so-called central bank digital [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=12.0s)]
*  currency, which is, by the way, not currency at all. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=17.04s)]
*  It's software. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=19.92s)]
*  But they're going to do it for your own good. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is a tool of total social control. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=23.48s)]
*  If they control your money, if they can zero out your bank account with a keystroke, then [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=26.88s)]
*  you have no autonomy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=31.04s)]
*  They control you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=33.44s)]
*  Well, in the state of South Dakota, legislators just passed a bill that would have changed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=34.44s)]
*  the definition of money to exclude cryptocurrency, and that would put the state on a path to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=38.56s)]
*  centralized digital currency. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=42.96s)]
*  South Dakota's governor, Kristi Noem, the only governor we're aware of who's paying [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=46.0s)]
*  attention to this, vetoed that bill. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  She joins us tonight to explain why. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=52.56s)]
*  Governor, thank you very much for doing this first and for coming on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=54.4s)]
*  Why did you do it? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=58.12s)]
*  You're obviously under pressure not to veto it, but you did. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=59.12s)]
*  Why did you? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=61.28s)]
*  Well, Tucker, it was the right thing to do. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=62.28s)]
*  I became aware of this bill. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=65.24s)]
*  It wasn't introduced until almost halfway through our legislative session. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=66.78s)]
*  We started reading through this bill that was over 110 pages long. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=70.7s)]
*  It was sold as an update to the guidelines of the Universal Commercial Code, backed by [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=74.88s)]
*  all of our financial institutions, our banks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=80.16000000000001s)]
*  As we started reading through it, we saw the section of the bill that changed the definition [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  of currency. And essentially what it did was pave the way for a government led CBDC, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  and it also banned any other form of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin or digital currency that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=94.64s)]
*  existed. So for me, it very clearly was a threat to our freedom. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=100.04s)]
*  In South Dakota, we are the session that completes its business earliest in the year. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  We are the first ones to really look at this bill and find out the truth of what's in it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=110.2s)]
*  And I did veto that bill. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=114.76s)]
*  I'm asking my legislators to change their minds, to make the right decision and help me [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=116.64s)]
*  kill this bill once and for all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=121.0s)]
*  But I'm telling you, Tucker, we've got the same language coming to over 20 other states. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=122.56s)]
*  I believe it's to pave a way for the federal government to control our currency and thus [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=127.36s)]
*  control people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=131.8s)]
*  It should be alarming to everyone and it's being sold as a UCC guidelines update. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=133.0s)]
*  There's no rush to do this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=138.0s)]
*  We need to be smart and make sure that we're doing what we can to protect people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=139.8s)]
*  I find it ironic that we also are having this discussion at the same time we have banks [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=143.52s)]
*  and credit card companies talking about coding gun and ammunition in a separate code so [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=147.72s)]
*  they can track it. So not only can they tie these two issues together, if the government [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=152.88s)]
*  doesn't approve of what you're purchasing, if they have the only form of digital currency [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=157.8s)]
*  out there and that is endorsed and utilized in the country, they can control how you spend [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=161.84s)]
*  that money and thus take away all your freedom. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=166.04s)]
*  So nicely put. And I don't think you're overstating at all the significance of this really [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  quickly. Do you think and you want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt on their [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=175.32s)]
*  motives. But do you think that legislators in your state understand what this bill was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  actually designed to do? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=182.56s)]
*  You know, I don't know if they read it, Tucker. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=184.76s)]
*  That's what is alarming to me is it was over 110 pages long and they were told by lobbyists [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=187.28s)]
*  that they had listened to for the last 20 years that it's fine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=195.28s)]
*  It's just a regulation update. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  This is what we do is adopt federal regulations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=201.4s)]
*  But if you start reading it, you see in there, there is a redefinition of currency that it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  says government CBDCs are OK if they're run by the government. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=209.24s)]
*  But any other form is then banned. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=214.08s)]
*  It is clearly a change for how people's assets are utilized. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=217.0s)]
*  It clearly limits the freedom of people to use other forms of currency that they may [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=220.8s)]
*  choose to if it is a digital currency. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=225.44s)]
*  And it is clearly putting power into the hands of government. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=227.96s)]
*  I think anything we should have learned the last several years is the government can't be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=230.88s)]
*  trusted. You know, Bill Tucker, what I was surprised by was that, you know, the bills that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=234.12s)]
*  have made it to my desk this year. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=238.6s)]
*  People think about South Dakota being conservative and being a very Republican state. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=239.88s)]
*  The first bill I had to veto was a tax increase. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=243.96s)]
*  Now, this has made it to my desk. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=246.36s)]
*  We've got other challenges as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=248.44s)]
*  I really hope that what you've done inspires other governors. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=251.24s)]
*  Appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=253.56s)]
*  Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota, thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRzWlmiXg&t=254.84s)]
