# Hegseth breaks down latest Russian advancements
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=0.0s)]
*  Russian forces are making significant [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=2.7s)]
*  inroads into Ukraine tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=4.4s)]
*  Fox is Pete Hegseth is looking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=5.92s)]
*  at the maps right now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=7.8s)]
*  Pete will you're exactly right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=9.08s)]
*  This is a map that if you look a couple [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=10.76s)]
*  of days past and forward, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  it doesn't change all that much in the red, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=14.56s)]
*  but that does not change the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=16.68s)]
*  calculus of the Russians who are [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=18.28s)]
*  have to deal with right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=20.0s)]
*  Even more sanctions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=21.68s)]
*  How they will deal with that is interesting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=22.48s)]
*  They're calling for reinforcements [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=24.8s)]
*  from as far as the Pacific Ocean. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=25.96s)]
*  Our border almost with them in Alaska [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=28.4s)]
*  and you've got new reports from ABC [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=30.72s)]
*  tonight that potentially additional [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=32.96s)]
*  weapons are coming in anti tank anti [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=34.4s)]
*  aircraft weapons on behalf of the Ukrainians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=36.96s)]
*  So dynamics always changing, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=39.44s)]
*  but ultimately the Russians [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  continue to make gains and they're [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  they're bogged down in Kia, but the. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=44.28s)]
*  But the airstrikes continue across the country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Let me move it forward if I may to the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=48.72s)]
*  next map which is pertinent to some of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=51.32s)]
*  the things you broke down tonight, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=53.84s)]
*  which is so important. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=55.84s)]
*  It's the fog of war, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=57.32s)]
*  but do our best to break down fact [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  from fiction of what's actually happening. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=60.88s)]
*  Here's what we know about what's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=62.88s)]
*  happening in the South. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=63.92s)]
*  So you've got. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=65.28s)]
*  Specific flash points which are important. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Maripol is a city that would [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=71.48s)]
*  connect the land bridge here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=73.68s)]
*  They're being bombarded. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=75.0s)]
*  They're turning off the lights. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=76.0s)]
*  They're turning off the water. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=76.92s)]
*  They're turning off the heat. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=77.84s)]
*  They're turning off the electricity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  They're turning off the Internet. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a total siege there in Carasson, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  which is this first major [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=84.56s)]
*  city to be taken will ultimately [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=85.6s)]
*  the Russians have not attempted to occupy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  What they know they can't do [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  is occupy city centers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=91.72s)]
*  They've committed almost 90% of their [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=93.36s)]
*  combat force around the border to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=95.32s)]
*  to Ukraine so far, and they can't occupy it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  So they've put in Ukrainian flag there, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=99.88s)]
*  but they are not trying to stay there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=102.28s)]
*  They're moving on and ultimately I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=103.56s)]
*  love what you talked about as far as the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  the nuclear facility. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=108.0s)]
*  Yes, there are nuclear reactors [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  that would be consequential, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  but the bombing that happened was on a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=114.24s)]
*  was on a administrative building [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=116.8s)]
*  which had no impact on those. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=119.36s)]
*  The impact that will happen will [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  is whether or not Vladimir Putin [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=122.32s)]
*  decides to use this energy as a weapon [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=123.96s)]
*  against the Ukrainian people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  as he continues to lay siege. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=128.24s)]
*  So he's moving forward city centers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=130.48s)]
*  They can't control them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=133.16s)]
*  They're trying to move to Kiev. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=134.44s)]
*  Ultimately, that's really enlightening, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=135.44s)]
*  Pete, and as we've talked about off [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  camera and on Fox and Friends, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=138.32s)]
*  we're a little too quick to dismiss [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=139.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin in the opening days [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=141.84s)]
*  of this war, too quick to dismiss Russia. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=143.16s)]
*  I'll see you in a couple hours. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=144.96s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=145.96s)]
*  On Fox and Friends. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuOoBD56uo&t=146.79999999999998s)]
