# Tulsi Gabbard tells Tucker the Biden admin have been 'busted' on 'absurd cover-up'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0)
*  The Biden administration has done everything it can for two years to stoke a third world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=0.0s)]
*  war beginning in Eastern Europe. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=4.44s)]
*  And that plan is unfolding before our eyes, and no one seems to notice. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=6.68s)]
*  Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, the despot who runs Ukraine, was unseen then last night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=10.56s)]
*  And he said he expects the Biden administration to give him F-16s soon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  We don't have the fighter jets to deal with it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=21.04s)]
*  To counteract the Russian hits. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=25.44s)]
*  And we really need this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=28.44s)]
*  And we really appeal to the president that they could start training Ukrainian pilots. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=31.64s)]
*  And President Biden told me that it will be worked upon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=37.6s)]
*  And I believe that the United States will give us the opportunity to defend and defend our skies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=41.68000000000001s)]
*  Haven't they been telling us for over a year that Russia is about to be defeated? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=49.92s)]
*  Then why are we sending an ever increasing amount of money and material to Ukraine? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=53.12s)]
*  Could they be lying to us? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=58.4s)]
*  And speaking of lying to us, remember they told us that Russia blew up its own pipeline? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=59.4s)]
*  The New York Times told us that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  Everyone told us that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Shut up, Putin defender! [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=64.84s)]
*  The Russians did it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=65.84s)]
*  Well, now they're admitting the Russians didn't do it, but we didn't do it either. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=66.84s)]
*  Something called the pro-Ukrainian group blew up the Nord Stream pipeline and created the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=70.12s)]
*  largest environmental disaster in human history and also shafted our NATO allies in Western [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=75.4s)]
*  Europe. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=81.24s)]
*  The Nord Stream pipeline is a pro-Ukrainian group. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=82.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=83.24s)]
*  Dulce Gabbard served in the congressman for president. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=84.24s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=86.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=87.0s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=89.0s)]
*  So this is a pro-Ukrainian group that has the military prowess to blow up one of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=90.0s)]
*  world's most important pipelines. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  But we had the Biden administration had nothing to do with it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=96.44s)]
*  Is that the new lie that they're telling us? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=98.78s)]
*  Apparently so. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  It is so obvious at this point, Tucker, that the United States and NATO are responsible [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  for this act of sabotage and act of war, attacking and destroying this Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=108.76s)]
*  They've been lying to us all along about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=112.76s)]
*  Now they've been busted. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=115.0s)]
*  And so they're trying to sell us this absurd cover-up story, where on the one hand they're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=116.0s)]
*  telling us, well, we have this new intelligence that shows us no Americans or Brits were [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  involved in this attack, but then at the same time, we can't draw any conclusions from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=124.44s)]
*  the intelligence on who actually did it, because we don't have specific details on each of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=128.56s)]
*  the members of this so-called pro-Ukrainian group. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=133.76s)]
*  It's insanity for anybody who's paying attention to what they're saying. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=137.2s)]
*  The reality is that they are responsible for this, and there are short-term and long-term, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  serious implications for this action. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  It sets this precedent, Tucker, for countries like Russia, North Korea, Iran and China to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=150.48s)]
*  go ahead and launch these attacks and sabotage against critical infrastructure, against other [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=156.6s)]
*  countries, like gas pipelines, undersea cables, financial systems, satellites. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=161.56s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  Just imagine the kind of problems, to say the least, that that would cause for us, the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=167.8s)]
*  American people, and for the world. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=173.24s)]
*  But can I just ask a super dumb question? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=175.36s)]
*  No one's ever answered it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=178.08s)]
*  So this pipeline fed Germany, which is the economic engine of Europe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=179.12s)]
*  Germany is the key player in NATO. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  We're all for NATO. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=184.68s)]
*  We just wrecked the economy of our key NATO ally. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=185.9s)]
*  If Germany blew up the Hoover Dam, would they still be our tight NATO ally? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=189.42s)]
*  Like, doesn't NATO have to disintegrate after we get caught doing this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=192.82s)]
*  You know, that's the thing here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=196.18s)]
*  I think a couple of points is the Biden administration, NATO, want us to believe that some—they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=198.5s)]
*  want us to believe this cover-up story, first of all, which their cover-up story implies [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  that the United States and NATO's military and intelligence agencies are so inept and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=209.42s)]
*  incapable that nobody knows what was going on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=213.98s)]
*  Nobody saw this coming. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=216.9s)]
*  But secondly, you're exactly right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=218.62s)]
*  This was an act of war not just against Russia, but also against our ally, Germany. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=220.74s)]
*  Also, an act of war can only be declared by Congress, not by the president of the United [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=225.46s)]
*  States or anybody else. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=230.38s)]
*  That clearly didn't happen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=231.9s)]
*  And that's where Biden needs to address the nation, tell us the whole truth about [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=233.5s)]
*  what went down, and Congress needs to exercise its oversight responsibilities to actually [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=238.46s)]
*  investigate this, to tell us the truth, get to the bottom of it, and to hold those responsible [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=244.06s)]
*  accountable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=249.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=250.62s)]
*  I mean, it's the craziest, most reckless thing I've ever seen in 50 years of sort [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=251.62s)]
*  of paying attention. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=255.54s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, thank you so much for continuing to call attention. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=256.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=259.02s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=260.02s)]
*  No one is paying attention. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=261.02s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=262.02s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uvHNS-7z0&t=263.02s)]
