# Kid Rock speaks out on potential destruction of Hank Williams' antebellum home
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U)
*  Beachwood Hall is an antebellum home [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=0.0s)]
*  near Franklin, Tennessee, right outside Nashville. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=2.44s)]
*  It's one of the few buildings of its size [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=4.32s)]
*  to survive the Civil War. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=5.92s)]
*  It's a national historic landmark. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  In the 1950s, country music legend, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=9.72s)]
*  Hank Williams bought Beachwood Hall. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=12.4s)]
*  More recently, country music stars Faith Hill [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=14.26s)]
*  and Tim McGraw lived there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=16.28s)]
*  Last year, a fund manager from California [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=17.96s)]
*  called Larry Keele bought the property. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=20.12s)]
*  Now, according to neighbors, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=22.7s)]
*  the property is in complete disrepair, as you can see. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=24.0s)]
*  And a nonprofit that oversees historic preservation [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=27.16s)]
*  called the Heritage Foundation of Williamson County [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=29.48s)]
*  is suggesting that Beachwood Hall [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=31.64s)]
*  could soon be demolished. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=33.2s)]
*  Keele, and we're not alleging anything here, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=36.16s)]
*  just noting, happens to be a major donor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=37.64s)]
*  to that nonprofit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=39.6s)]
*  So the question is, how much American history [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=41.6s)]
*  do you have to lose before you lose the country itself? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=43.84s)]
*  In the last two years, we've lost statues [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=46.94s)]
*  and monuments and our customs. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  So tearing down Hank Williams' house, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  an antebellum house, would constitute not just an assault [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=54.24s)]
*  on the soul of country music, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  but a distinctly American art form. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=58.64s)]
*  It would be an attack on the country itself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=60.04s)]
*  And maybe we've had enough, maybe no more. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=62.12s)]
*  Kid Rock appears to feel that way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=64.92s)]
*  He is, of course, a country music legend, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=66.92s)]
*  lives in Nashville, joins us tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=68.68s)]
*  Kid Rock, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=70.08s)]
*  So you have your own house. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=72.22s)]
*  Why are you interested in this house [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=74.0s)]
*  and what happens to it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=75.56s)]
*  I think like so many other people in this country [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=79.2s)]
*  who are sick of seeing history tore to the ground, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=81.04s)]
*  whether it be in the form of monuments, statues, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=83.8s)]
*  and now something so important here in Nashville, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=85.72s)]
*  like the former home of Hank Williams, Beechwood Hall. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=87.64s)]
*  I also might note it was also the former home [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=90.2s)]
*  of Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=92.04s)]
*  Where does this end? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=95.04s)]
*  We kind of all knew that from the beginning [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=96.12s)]
*  once this fiasco started that it was never gonna end. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=97.56s)]
*  And now we kind of feel like we're under an invasion [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=100.64s)]
*  from the state of California, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=104.52s)]
*  which we understand in a lot of ways. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=106.56s)]
*  I have a lot of friends here that come from these spots, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=109.12s)]
*  California, New York City. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=111.12s)]
*  And this is kind of a house because we feel [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=114.12s)]
*  that a lot of people say it and they say it under their breath [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=116.84s)]
*  but they're scared to say it out loud. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=118.64s)]
*  So once again, I'll be the guy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=120.0s)]
*  Is you know, they come here leaving these woke policies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=122.24s)]
*  from these cities, you know, for better schools, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=125.2s)]
*  lower taxes, lower crime. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=127.84s)]
*  We've talked about that you've talked about a million times [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=130.84s)]
*  and we kind of tell them, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=133.6s)]
*  leave your effing politics at the state. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=134.88s)]
*  This is what you're coming. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=138.2s)]
*  And this is just one more example [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=140.04s)]
*  of somebody from California who, as I understood, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  gave a handshake to people in the community [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=144.48s)]
*  and through this foundation that he's a donor for. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=147.56s)]
*  And now he basically is, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=149.44s)]
*  seems like another avenue to tear it down. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=151.88s)]
*  And I don't think there's anything more important [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=155.16s)]
*  in country music, if not American music, than Hank Williams. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=156.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=161.56s)]
*  The greatest songwriter of all times. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=162.4s)]
*  And I think great songwriters would be in agreement. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=163.72s)]
*  So can I just ask, I mean, we don't know the motive [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=168.4s)]
*  and we don't have this man on the show tonight, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  but why would you move to a new place [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=172.36s)]
*  and then want to tear down its history? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=175.16s)]
*  Doesn't that seem kind of a weird thing to do? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=177.08s)]
*  Yeah, we call them dumb liberals. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=185.68s)]
*  Well, that's one explanation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=186.96s)]
*  Hank Williams, this is, I think that's fair. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=189.16s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=192.52s)]
*  That says it all. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=193.52s)]
*  So this Hank Williams is, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=194.36s)]
*  if there's an icon in Nashville, it's Hank Williams, okay? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=196.24s)]
*  So is Nashville as, right, exactly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=198.96s)]
*  And this was his former property. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  So as a community, is Nashville rising up against this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  to preserve this historic property? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=209.0s)]
*  Are you the only one? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=210.52s)]
*  I think, well, I'm kind of, you know, thanks to you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=214.36s)]
*  and people that care about these things, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=217.68s)]
*  I've just kind of become the person to put it out there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=220.36s)]
*  So I think now that you're broadcasting the story [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  to all of America, I think there's gonna be many, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=227.08s)]
*  many people to get on board. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  They can go to savebeachwood.org. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think you're gonna see a lot more [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=233.44s)]
*  country music stars, musicians, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=235.32s)]
*  just great people in the community [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=237.4s)]
*  that wanna preserve this for the next generation to come, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  generations beyond that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=242.32s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=244.08s)]
*  I mean, we both believe in private property, of course, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  and defend it, but there are some monuments [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=246.84s)]
*  that aren't really yours. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=249.36s)]
*  They're custodian, you know? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=250.8s)]
*  You hold them till the next generation comes, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=252.12s)]
*  and this sounds like one of them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=254.28s)]
*  I appreciate, Kid Rock. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=255.4s)]
*  And when you say, when you come into it [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=256.24s)]
*  with a handshake kind of thing and say, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=259.2s)]
*  I'm going to preserve this, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=260.88s)]
*  and then you start weaseling around to do other things, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=262.04s)]
*  you know, we hope to get this resolved in a good manner, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=264.24s)]
*  but if not, we can get some hillbilly going on too. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=268.6s)]
*  Well, I'll leave that to you to solve, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  but thank you for bringing this to our attention. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=276.0s)]
*  The country's lost so much of its history. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=277.56s)]
*  How about no more? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  Great to see you, Kid Rock. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vLbTCD_B3U&t=280.48s)]
