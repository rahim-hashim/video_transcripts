# Victor Davis Hanson blasts Left's 'Let's go Brandon' hypocrisy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg)
*  Aside from fangirling Tony Fauci on live television, there's nothing much Jeb Bush's former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=0.0s)]
*  flack loves more than insurrection. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=5.68s)]
*  It's all she talks about. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=7.68s)]
*  She can't let it go. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  That's why, with waning interest in the events of January 6, Nicole Wallace is identifying [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=11.52s)]
*  a new insurrection, saying, let's go, Brandon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=16.68s)]
*  This was her reaction to an Oregon man who uttered the phrase, on a Christmas Eve call [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=20.72s)]
*  with Joe Biden. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=25.12s)]
*  I don't know where to start. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=26.12s)]
*  Let me tell you why this matters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=29.12s)]
*  The asymmetry has always been what advantages the Trump right more than anything else. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=32.36s)]
*  And the asymmetry of saying, F you, to a sitting president on a call in front of your four [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=37.28s)]
*  kids. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Don't look past this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=45.16s)]
*  Don't look at this as a story about giving airtime to a MAGA guy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  This is the slow motion insurrection, Jason, in full color. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=52.36s)]
*  A slow motion insurrection. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=58.64s)]
*  Victor Davis-Hanson is with the Hoover Institution and he joins us live. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=61.12s)]
*  I see your smile, Victor. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=65.16s)]
*  I spoke to you a little over a week ago and we talked about these fads, trends, verbal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=66.52s)]
*  tics that seem to take over the human mind, many times the mind of the left. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=71.92s)]
*  Save our democracy, racial equity, social justice. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=76.6s)]
*  seems to be the most frequent and recent mental tick earworm. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=81.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if saying let's go, Brandon, is insurrectionary, what would be a CNN contributor [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=89.44s)]
*  holding up the facsimile of Donald Trump's decapitated head? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=96.96s)]
*  Or what was night after night in Central Park having a lookalike Donald Trump as Julius [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=102.0s)]
*  Caesar being stabbed repeatedly to death? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  Or what was Hillary Clinton saying after the election that the elected president was not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=110.24s)]
*  legitimate and urging Joe Biden not to concede under any circumstances? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=114.48s)]
*  Or for that matter, what was this Obama Pentagon lawyer writing in foreign policy 11 days into [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=119.68s)]
*  the Trump term that we should consider removing Trump either by the 25th Amendment impeachment [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=126.08s)]
*  or a military coup? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=132.32s)]
*  A military coup was on the minds of a lot of retired generals. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=134.0s)]
*  We had two that wrote letters that Mark Milley should intervene. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=138.24s)]
*  We had another distinguished admiral said that Trump should leave the sooner the better. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=140.8s)]
*  So we know what it's really about, Will. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=145.92s)]
*  We talked about it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=147.6s)]
*  That Donald Trump, old horse, has been beaten to death. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=149.28s)]
*  So is January 6th. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=152.08s)]
*  And they're afraid of democracy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=154.08s)]
*  They're afraid that the people are going to speak. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=155.52s)]
*  And so a month ago, we were talking about the theme democracy is broken in 2022. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=157.36s)]
*  There's going to be a coup in 2024. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=163.68s)]
*  Then we had military officers echoing that charge. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  And now we have the insurrection meme. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  But it's all a fear of what's going to happen in the midterms. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=171.44s)]
*  And if they were rational people, they would get around the table and say, this agenda [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=175.44s)]
*  is not good for the American people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  We need to reboot. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  And they can't do that because they're hardcore ideologues. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  You said something else that I found very fascinating. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  You said this is a replacement for actually having a positive agenda, of actually doing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=190.56s)]
*  something that helps solve the nation's problems, that in place of that, vilifying your political [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=196.0s)]
*  opponent at all times as insurrectionists or as racists is the last political tool of a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=200.8s)]
*  failing regime. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=207.68s)]
*  Tell me more about that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=209.2s)]
*  Because, you know, Victor, 10 years ago, the Obama administration prided itself on having [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=210.4s)]
*  a transformative agenda for America. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=215.6s)]
*  Now it's more about transforming your political opponent into the devil. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=218.56s)]
*  It was. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=224.56s)]
*  But even Barack Obama realized that when his agenda started to fail, he didn't reboot. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=225.12s)]
*  But he did something else. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=229.6s)]
*  He just disappeared. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  And he allowed the Democrats and Republicans to fight for the next administration on his [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=232.32s)]
*  last year. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=238.32s)]
*  And he disappeared to the golf course. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=238.96s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=240.56s)]
*  His polls went up because he was just disengaged and people didn't have to hear his sermons. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=241.04s)]
*  And Joe Biden is president, and he can't do that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=246.48s)]
*  He was pretty good when he was in the basement and he was not seen or heard very much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=249.44s)]
*  But the people around him are incapable, as all ideologues and zealots, they're incapable [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  of self-criticism and self-introspection. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=261.28s)]
*  And they've hijacked the Democratic Party. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  And the Democratic mainstream, such as it is, they're terrified of saying to them, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=266.56s)]
*  you have destroyed our party. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  We either got to retire or we're going to be defeated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=273.92s)]
*  Do something different on the border. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  Regain deterrence after Afghanistan. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=278.32s)]
*  Stop these crazy inflationary policies. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  They could say that, but they can't. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  And so it's either Donald Trump on Monday, January 6th on Tuesday, or coup, coup, coup, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=285.12s)]
*  and democracy is destroyed on Wednesday. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=290.56s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=294.0s)]
*  It would be racism or homophobia or sexism the rest of the week. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=294.56s)]
*  And people are sick of it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=298.88s)]
*  And they're going to pay a price in the midterms. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=300.48s)]
*  And they know it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=302.48s)]
*  And they're scared of democracy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=305.44s)]
*  Racism on Thursday and apparently it's insurrection on Friday. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=305.76s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen, thank you so much for always putting it into perspective. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=309.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU2AyWQoflg&t=312.96000000000004s)]
