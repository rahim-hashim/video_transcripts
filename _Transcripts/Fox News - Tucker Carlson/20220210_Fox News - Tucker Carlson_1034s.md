# Tucker: Justin Trudeau is attacking human rights
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, when Democratic politicians across this country all of a sudden started to pull [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=3.08s)]
*  back their mask mandates, he did it virtually overnight and of course they did it in unison, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=6.74s)]
*  we naturally assumed that new polling had to be behind it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=11.36s)]
*  Someone at the DNC must have seen terrifying public opinion numbers and decided to abandon [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=14.6s)]
*  project quarantine before the midterm elections. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=20.1s)]
*  That made sense to us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=22.84s)]
*  We explained that theory in the show last night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=23.84s)]
*  We still think it's probably pretty true. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=25.8s)]
*  But it's also clear as of tonight that there is another explanation for this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=27.72s)]
*  Democrats in this country are looking north to their friends in the ruling party of Canada [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=32.92s)]
*  and what they see there scares them. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=37.4s)]
*  Canada's working class has finally rebelled after years of relentless abuse. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=40.4s)]
*  Truck drivers are threatening to topple Justin Trudeau's creepy little government with their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  big rigs. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=49.56s)]
*  And they may succeed, actually. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  The protests against Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates have been far more effective than [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=52.82s)]
*  anyone in charge imagined. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=57.26s)]
*  For Democrats in the United States, that's a pretty obvious lesson. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=59.76s)]
*  Over the past 48 hours, Canadian truckers have blocked the major trade routes between [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  their country and ours. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=68.12s)]
*  Last night, farmers driving heavy agricultural equipment shut down the highways at the Manitoba [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=70.6s)]
*  border with the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=74.68s)]
*  You're seeing footage now from the town of Emerson, Manitoba. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=76.5s)]
*  1100 miles away, a similar scene on the border of Ontario in the United States. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=79.9s)]
*  Green tractors with Canadian flags lining the highway in protest. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=85.02s)]
*  But the most meaningful blockade of all is taking place right now on the Ambassador Bridge. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=89.34s)]
*  That's the privately owned span that connects Detroit to Windsor, Ontario. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=93.98s)]
*  If you live in the Upper Midwest, you know it well. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=98.62s)]
*  A quarter of all the trade between the United States and Canada, one of another's biggest [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=100.7s)]
*  trading partners, that's billions of dollars, comes across that bridge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=104.86s)]
*  And as Fox's Molly Lyne is reporting from Ottawa, that bridge is now completely shut down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=109.02s)]
*  We're Canadian and we want to be free Canadians. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=114.02s)]
*  Increasing concerns spreading through Canada and now the U.S. as the Freedom Convoy threatens [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=118.06s)]
*  trade along the border. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=122.3s)]
*  Truckers blocking traffic at the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit and Ontario. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=125.94s)]
*  A second crossing linking Alberta and Montana also shut down by protesters, calling for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=129.82s)]
*  an end to all COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=134.5s)]
*  We want freedom, freedom of all mandates, and that's what we're fighting for. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=138.18s)]
*  The Ambassador Bridge is the busiest international crossing in North America, carrying 25% of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=142.62s)]
*  all trade between Canada and the U.S. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=147.46s)]
*  We want freedom, the truckers are saying, freedom from mandates. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=151.3s)]
*  It's a very straightforward ask, but so far the truckers don't have that freedom and so [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=154.22s)]
*  their blockade continues. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=158.7s)]
*  So far that blockade has forced the Ford Motor Company to shut down one of its manufacturing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  plants and to operate another plant with a skeleton crew. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=166.08s)]
*  Toyota says it won't be able to manufacture vehicles in Ontario for the rest of the week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  General Motors has canceled multiple shifts at its plant in Lansing, Michigan due to park [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  shortages. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=177.24s)]
*  So this protest is less than a week old and already it is causing deep pain to at least [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  one global industry. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=183.44s)]
*  It's hard to overstate the historical significance of what we're watching right here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=186.0s)]
*  The Canadian Trucker Convoy is the single most successful human rights protest in a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=189.8s)]
*  generation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  If nothing else, it has been a very useful reminder to our entitled ruling class that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  working class men can be pushed, but only so far. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=200.24s)]
*  When they push back, it hurts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  It turns out that truck drivers are more important to a country's future than say diversity consultants [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=207.3s)]
*  or even MSNBC contributors. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=211.46s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=213.84s)]
*  The White House has no interest in knowing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=214.84s)]
*  According to the Associated Press tonight, the Biden administration is, quote, urging [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=217.8s)]
*  the Trudeau government to, quote, use its federal powers to stop this protest, to end [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=221.5s)]
*  the trucker's protest, in other words, crush them by force. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=227.56s)]
*  Politico is reporting that Biden officials are coordinating with Canadian authorities [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=231.08s)]
*  to, quote, establish alternate traffic routes around the protesters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=235.24s)]
*  That's Scranton Joe, the pro-union guy, shutting down a labor action. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=240.36s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg is the completely incompetent transportation secretary in this country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  Apparently, he's in charge of this effort. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=248.92s)]
*  What Mayor Pete does not realize is it's not so easy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  Truck drivers know a lot more about roads than McKinsey consultants do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=254.54s)]
*  An alternative border crossing in Alberta, for example, has already been totally shut [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=261.32s)]
*  They thought of that already, Mayor Pete. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=262.32s)]
*  The Blue Water Bridge, which connects Ontario to Port Huron, Michigan, has been reporting [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=263.84s)]
*  delays tonight of nearly five hours. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=267.64s)]
*  Now, there is an obvious way to fix this problem. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=270.2s)]
*  Matthew Maroon, who's the owner of the Ambassador Bridge into Michigan, just spelled it out [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=273.48s)]
*  for Justin Trudeau, who's not terribly bright. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=277.68s)]
*  End the vaccine mandates and the bridge reopens. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=280.28s)]
*  It's not hard. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=284.2s)]
*  But Justin Trudeau won't. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=285.92s)]
*  And he's decided he doesn't have to, because the truckers, as he's explained, have no [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=288.16s)]
*  legitimate complaint. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=292.48s)]
*  They're racists, so we're not required to listen to them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=294.36s)]
*  Here is Trudeau in the Canadian Parliament on Monday. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  The people of Ottawa don't deserve to be harassed in their own neighbourhoods. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't deserve to be confronted with the inherent violence of a swastika flying [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  on a street corner, or a confederate flag, or the insults and jeers just because they're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=313.72s)]
*  wearing a mask. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=322.72s)]
*  That's not who Canada, who Canadians are. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=326.88s)]
*  Oh, so they're not even really Canadians. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=330.16s)]
*  They're Nazis. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=333.12s)]
*  So you don't have to hear anything they say. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=334.12s)]
*  They don't even belong here. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=336.24s)]
*  Maybe we'll intern them or expel them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  Trudeau's state broadcasters have been repeating these lies over and over and over again for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=340.24s)]
*  maximum effect. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=344.88000000000005s)]
*  Pravda, parroting Brezhnev. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=346.0s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=348.12s)]
*  What's striking, however, is that the media in our country claim to be independent, but [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=349.12s)]
*  they've been doing the very same thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=354.68s)]
*  Some of the organisers of this protest, which as I mentioned, started more than a week ago, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  they do want to overthrow the government. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=360.68s)]
*  Canadian officials calling the situation a quote, nationwide insurrection. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=362.64s)]
*  The police chief says COVID protests are a quote, nationwide insurrection driven by madness. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=367.8s)]
*  A nationwide insurrection driven by madness. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=373.0s)]
*  Just think of the language. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=376.12s)]
*  I know it sounds familiar to you, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=377.68s)]
*  A threat to democracy, an insurrection, sedition. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=379.36s)]
*  The police say that they are under resourced and they are overwhelmed. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=382.84s)]
*  They have said that this city is under siege. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=386.56s)]
*  It's not just truckers. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=388.84s)]
*  There's a lot of, I've heard there's QAnon supporters in the crowd. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=389.84s)]
*  Residents that I have spoken to who say they feel terrorised, intimidated. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  It's a cult. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=398.2s)]
*  There are QAnon supporters in the crowd. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=402.64s)]
*  It's a cult. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=405.28s)]
*  They're Nazis and they're crazy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=406.84s)]
*  Insurrectionists on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=410.12s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, they're using these smears because typically they work. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  Just dismiss these people. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=416.56s)]
*  Don't listen to them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=417.56s)]
*  They didn't go to college. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=418.56s)]
*  But what Justin Trudeau apparently didn't count on is that a handful of independent [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=420.64s)]
*  journalists are committing journalism inside Canada. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=424.2s)]
*  And a free press works. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=428.08s)]
*  That's why we have it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=429.79999999999995s)]
*  Or did. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  So, instead of repeating state mandated talking points like their journalists do and the morons [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  in our press corps do, these independent reporters have been broadcasting hours long [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=436.64s)]
*  interviews with the truckers themselves in their cabs, totally unfiltered. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=440.96s)]
*  So you can decide what you think. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=445.12s)]
*  You can actually make your own judgement about reality. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  So you watch these streams for just a few minutes and you realise that these truckers, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=449.47999999999996s)]
*  whatever their faults may be, are far less odious and much harder working than the journalists [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=452.96s)]
*  and the politicians who call them Nazis. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=458.4s)]
*  Here's one 24 year old protester who saved up and bought his own truck. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=461.0s)]
*  He's an owner operator now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=463.96s)]
*  He's losing hundreds of dollars every day because he's no longer working, but he says [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=465.76s)]
*  it's worth it because he's more concerned about human rights than about his own pay [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=470.0s)]
*  check. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=472.8s)]
*  You decide. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=473.8s)]
*  I agree with freedom of choice. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=474.8s)]
*  So, if you want to wear a diaper over your face, go ahead, you know. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=476.8s)]
*  You can wear a face diaper if you want, but why should I? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=481.64s)]
*  Because of your fear, I got to wear that garbage on my face, you know. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=485.76s)]
*  I've been doing that for two years. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=490.36s)]
*  They said two weeks, but it's turned into two years, so enough is enough. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=493.92s)]
*  The voice of the working man there. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=500.48s)]
*  You know how he knows he's a Nazi? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=501.48s)]
*  Because he used the word freedom. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=502.88s)]
*  Now that footage, of course, was not shot by the CBC, which is Canadian state media, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=504.56s)]
*  the most dishonest of all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=509.16s)]
*  It was from a live stream on the YouTube channel Zot. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=510.6s)]
*  It was filmed just after midnight this morning. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=512.92s)]
*  Zot is run by a man you've never heard of called Matt Garcia. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=515.32s)]
*  Garcia is one of a handful of independent YouTube channel operators who are doing what [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=518.32s)]
*  legacy media refuses to do anywhere, ever, anymore. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=522.4s)]
*  Garcia actually talks to people. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=526.88s)]
*  He reports. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=528.64s)]
*  He's paid to do this. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=529.64s)]
*  He's doing it because nobody else will do it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=530.64s)]
*  You should watch it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=532.52s)]
*  It's compelling because you can hear people speak and you can decide what you think about [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=534.0s)]
*  what they have to say. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=537.92s)]
*  Here's another protester that Garcia spoke to in the streets of Ottawa. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=539.68s)]
*  This man says that Justin Trudeau's authoritarian behavior reminds him of the ayatollahs in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=543.08s)]
*  the country he left, which is Iran. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=547.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=549.56s)]
*  I'm from Iran and I am proud to be between the freedom-loving Canadian patriots. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=550.56s)]
*  Are you doing it all? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=559.64s)]
*  No, I came here from Toronto. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=561.64s)]
*  I did a speech on the stage and I lost my freedom once in Iran by the ayatollahs, by [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=565.64s)]
*  the mullahs. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=573.12s)]
*  I don't want to lose my freedom again in Canada. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  So what's the answer to him? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=579.92s)]
*  Is he in QAnon? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  Is he a Nazi? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=582.56s)]
*  Is he a white supremacist? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=583.6s)]
*  The protestors are so immoral, we have no obligation to listen to them because democracy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=586.6s)]
*  We all lose when they do that because actually the truckers do have something to say. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=600.08s)]
*  Some of them are pretty articulate. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=604.32s)]
*  Some of them are even eloquent about what they want. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=605.64s)]
*  So as a public service, we thought you might like to hear it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=609.4s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=611.4s)]
*  There's nothing extreme about wanting people to be able to make their own decisions in [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=612.68s)]
*  their home that is the best decision for their families. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=616.76s)]
*  There's nothing extreme about that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  No, that's not extreme. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=623.68s)]
*  If you want to see extremism, take a close look at how Canada's ruling class is responding [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  to these decidedly non-extreme protests. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=632.12s)]
*  Authorities in Canada are now stealing firewood from protesters in sub-zero temperatures. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=635.72s)]
*  You're seeing that theft on your screen right now. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=640.56s)]
*  They're not making it up. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=642.08s)]
*  Now that wood is not being used in a crime. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=643.6s)]
*  They're not using it to rob liquor stores. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=646.0s)]
*  The protesters are using the wood to keep from freezing to death in February. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=648.72s)]
*  But Trudeau's enforcers just took it from him. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=653.08s)]
*  Them. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  They also seized fuel, which the truckers were using to keep from dying in their cabs [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=656.0400000000001s)]
*  overnight. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=659.84s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=660.84s)]
*  You take those cans off of that truck. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=661.84s)]
*  Is that your property? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=664.64s)]
*  It is now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=665.64s)]
*  It is now? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  So you have the right to take gas cans off of a trucker's truck. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=671.76s)]
*  It is correct. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=672.76s)]
*  According to what? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=673.76s)]
*  Aiding and abetting criminal? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=674.76s)]
*  A criminal offense. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=675.76s)]
*  A criminal offense. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=676.76s)]
*  So now when you have gas cans on your truck, it's a criminal offense. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=677.76s)]
*  This guy's name's Trudeau. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=688.04s)]
*  So let's say you were on American television or you worked at the Brookings Institution [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=690.84s)]
*  or the Atlantic Council or you were Liz Cheney or any one of the many people who lecture [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=694.72s)]
*  you every day about democracy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=698.36s)]
*  What would you make of that exchange? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=700.56s)]
*  Now you may not like the guy's beard or you may not like who he voted for, but what's [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=701.9599999999999s)]
*  your answer to him? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=706.64s)]
*  If police are breaking the law by enforcing an order from the guy who runs the country, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  is that a democracy? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not a free country. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a very scary place. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=719.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what Canada has become under Justin Trudeau. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  We'll play just one more clip. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=724.3599999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of these, but we're not going to drag it out. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=725.3599999999999s)]
*  You see the point. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=727.56s)]
*  Watch this one. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=728.56s)]
*  These are police acting under Justin Trudeau's orders, dragging an elderly man to jail and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=729.68s)]
*  hurting him along the way. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=734.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=736.2399999999999s)]
*  Because he dared to honk his horn in support of the truckers. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=737.2399999999999s)]
*  What's your name and badge number? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=741.4s)]
*  Look, they're hurting an old man, a Canadian citizen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=742.88s)]
*  It's communism. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=748.1999999999999s)]
*  This is communism. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  He's scared. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  Communists. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  You stand with the communist government. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  Call your police chief. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=758.4s)]
*  He'll back you up. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=759.4s)]
*  Call your police chief. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=762.4s)]
*  Arrested an old man. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=763.4s)]
*  Shame on you. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=767.24s)]
*  Shame on you. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=769.24s)]
*  They hurt him too. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  Look up his bruises on the Internet. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  So in the end, Canadians are nice people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=777.36s)]
*  The cliche is true. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  And they're seeing some of this. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=780.24s)]
*  It's being hidden from them on their state media, but it's all on the Internet. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  So Justin Trudeau is attacking human rights and attacking humans. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=785.48s)]
*  And that ultimately is bound to provoke a backlash. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=790.52s)]
*  And it is. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=794.2s)]
*  The province of Alberta just announced is lifting its COVID restrictions and scrapping [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=795.2s)]
*  its vaccine passport system completely. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=799.5s)]
*  Saskatchewan, Quebec, Prince Edward Island have done the same. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  They're getting rid of most of their COVID restrictions in the face of this, in response [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=806.28s)]
*  to this. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=809.96s)]
*  You go too far, as Ceausescu learned, people turn against you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=811.08s)]
*  It was just a few days ago that a guy called Jagmeet Singh, he's the leader of Canada's [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=815.8000000000001s)]
*  supposedly pro-worker NDP party, smeared the truckers as racist. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=820.0400000000001s)]
*  Of course, quote, those that claim the superiority of the white bloodline. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=825.4000000000001s)]
*  What a pig. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  It's always the same lie. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=831.52s)]
*  But yesterday, even Jagmeet Singh finally realized the same old slander doesn't work [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=833.36s)]
*  anymore. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=838.72s)]
*  So he went to plan B. He went for a federal plan to, quote, exit the pandemic. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=839.86s)]
*  In other words, he caved in the face of principled human rights protests. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=845.0s)]
*  That's how that works. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=849.66s)]
*  Several members of Justin Trudeau's own Liberal Party are now rebuking Justin Trudeau. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=851.42s)]
*  One of those lawmakers, a member of parliament called Joelle Lightbound, described Justin [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=856.16s)]
*  Trudeau's vaccine mandates as, quote, an attempt to wedge, to divide, and to stigmatize. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=860.04s)]
*  I fear that this politicization of the pandemic risks undermining the public's trust in our [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=865.58s)]
*  public health institutions. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=870.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh, you think? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=871.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=873.74s)]
*  We in America know a little bit about that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=874.7800000000001s)]
*  Who will trust a doctor when the smoke settles from corona? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=876.44s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=880.4000000000001s)]
*  But on a political level, anyone watching this understands just how profound the betrayal [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=881.84s)]
*  is. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=888.0s)]
*  The betrayal, both in Canada and in the United States. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=889.0s)]
*  Self-described liberals, the ones who've lectured you for decades about the nobility [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=892.6s)]
*  of organized labor, are now taking the side of management, of strikebreakers, over striking [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=897.24s)]
*  workers. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=902.32s)]
*  They're applauding like Mr. Burns on The Simpsons as cops harass and abuse strikers [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=903.32s)]
*  and their families. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=908.12s)]
*  Pretty soon they'll be demanding scabs. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=909.12s)]
*  Literally, if they aren't already. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=910.9200000000001s)]
*  It's so deeply revealing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=913.4s)]
*  Scratch a liberal and you'll find a fascist. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=915.4s)]
*  Today on Twitter, an Obama DHS official called Juliette Kayam called for violence against [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=917.84s)]
*  the truckers. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=923.48s)]
*  Slash their tires, she demanded. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=924.48s)]
*  But don't stop there. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=926.12s)]
*  Quote, cancel their insurance. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=927.44s)]
*  Suspend their driver's licenses. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=929.52s)]
*  Prohibit any future regulatory certification for truckers, et cetera. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=930.9200000000001s)]
*  Have we learned nothing, fellow members of the ruling class? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=934.8000000000001s)]
*  These things fester when there are no consequences. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=938.2800000000001s)]
*  Crush them before they get big ideas. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=942.08s)]
*  Now, Juliette Kayam is a nasty little fascist. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=946.0s)]
*  And of course she's a CNN contributor too. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=948.24s)]
*  Of course she is. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=949.8399999999999s)]
*  But we will concede, Juliette Kayam is right about one thing. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=951.52s)]
*  These things do fester. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=954.8s)]
*  When you ignore the population's legitimate concerns for long enough. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=956.92s)]
*  When you dismiss your own citizens as racists and conspiracy nuts and try to shut them down [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=961.8s)]
*  for long enough. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=968.0s)]
*  At some point, they are apt to revolt. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=969.52s)]
*  Once people realize they're citizens, not serfs, you can't really know where things [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=973.0s)]
*  go from there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=978.6s)]
*  And in that vein, tonight, a group of American truckers announced they will begin a nationwide [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=981.32s)]
*  truck convoy in this country starting next month in protest against Joe Biden's vaccine [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=986.12s)]
*  mandates. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=991.2s)]
*  That rally will begin in Southern California on March 5th and then it will progress eastward [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=992.48s)]
*  by truck to Washington, D.C., a city they still perhaps naively assume is the capital [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=996.36s)]
*  of their country. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1001.0799999999999s)]
*  How does the supposedly pro-union White House feel about this? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1003.56s)]
*  They're completely panicked. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1006.88s)]
*  Working class people expressing their opinions, that's not allowed. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1008.48s)]
*  So Joe Biden, taking a page from Justin Trudeau, his friend to the North, has already set [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1011.4s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security to work to shut them down. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1015.68s)]
*  We'll be covering that in some detail. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1019.56s)]
*  There is some drama ahead. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5A8Glngr8&t=1020.98s)]
