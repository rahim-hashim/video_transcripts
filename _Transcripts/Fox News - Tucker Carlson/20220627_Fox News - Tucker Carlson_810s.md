# Tucker Carlson: This is a coordinated attack on the family
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're coming to you this evening from Rio de Janeiro, which is a huge and beautiful [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  and very complex city on the South American coast. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=7.2s)]
*  We're going to be here all week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=10.82s)]
*  We're filming a documentary for our Tucker Carlson original series on the rise of Chinese [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=12.0s)]
*  power and influence in Brazil. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=16.52s)]
*  Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America by far. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=19.5s)]
*  It's one of the biggest in the world and it is the most important ally of the United States [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=22.12s)]
*  in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=27.32s)]
*  Brazil is a big deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=28.96s)]
*  And yet the Biden administration seems determined to hand Brazil over to the sphere of influence [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=31.0s)]
*  of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=37.08s)]
*  Why is that exactly? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=39.44s)]
*  We hope to find out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=41.4s)]
*  We'll also be sitting down for a rare interview with the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=42.4s)]
*  soon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=47.44s)]
*  We'll bring that to you when we do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=48.44s)]
*  But first, we'd like to begin with the loud and at times violent response to the end of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=50.36s)]
*  that came down to the Supreme Court on Friday, as you know. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=56.3s)]
*  If you've been following this, you may have noticed a profound change in the way the Democratic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  Party talks about the issue of abortion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=64.25999999999999s)]
*  Gone is the empathy or the room for compromise. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=68.34s)]
*  So from the very beginning of this debate, 50 years ago, even the staunchest pro-lifer [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=72.74s)]
*  acknowledged the anguish of young women who are pregnant and don't want to be, who are [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=78.06s)]
*  alone and feel trapped by the child growing inside them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=82.9s)]
*  And that is the reason that pro-life institutions have built crisis pregnancy centers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=86.34s)]
*  And to be fair, for generations, even the most committed pro-choicers acknowledged the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=91.86000000000001s)]
*  inherent sadness of abortion, which at the very least is the end of a potential life. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  Quote, I do not view abortion as a choice, said Joe Biden as recently as 2006. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=101.66000000000001s)]
*  I think it's always a tragedy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=107.9s)]
*  And of course, it always is a tragedy, even if you believe it should be legal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=110.66s)]
*  And Democrats once said this out loud, forthrightly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=115.74s)]
*  In fact, in 1997, as White House counsel, now Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan urged [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=118.66s)]
*  her boss, Bill Clinton, to sign a ban on partial birth abortions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=124.02s)]
*  Elena Kagan has always been pro-choice, but ending the life of a child the week before [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=128.22s)]
*  birth was too much even for her. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=133.22s)]
*  And of course, for his part, Bill Clinton never spoke about abortion as anything but [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=135.74s)]
*  as a last resort. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=139.58s)]
*  He famously described it as something that should be, quote, safe, legal and rare. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=140.78s)]
*  Our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal, but rare. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=146.26000000000002s)]
*  You don't hear that on the left anymore, ever. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=152.94s)]
*  In fact, many on the left now behave as if abortion is itself a positive good, excited [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=156.78s)]
*  by the fact that a child who would have been born wasn't. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=163.74s)]
*  Think about that for a moment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=167.8s)]
*  The failure of a child to come into the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=170.42s)]
*  What does that say about how you feel about children or about people? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=173.58s)]
*  In fact, some behave as if having an abortion is preferable to having children. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=176.62s)]
*  How do we know this? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=182.58s)]
*  Well, no one on the left encourages women to brag about having kids. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=183.3s)]
*  Having more than a couple of children, at most, in fact, is considered weird and embarrassing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=187.5s)]
*  Something that Mormons and people who live in the ghetto do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=192.14s)]
*  But abortion? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=195.38s)]
*  That's something to tell your friends about. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=196.62s)]
*  There's even a shout your abortion campaign, highly well-funded, complete with perky t-shirts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=198.54s)]
*  bragging about ending your pregnancy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  What does that say? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=205.78s)]
*  Nothing good. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=208.06s)]
*  Over the weekend, you saw a lot of people proudly shouting about their abortions at [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=209.38s)]
*  pro-choice riots all over the country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  Here's what Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles looked like. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  What is that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=228.42s)]
*  The hysteria is telling. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=251.61999999999998s)]
*  It's not the assault on bodily autonomy of the end of Roe vs. Wade. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=253.86s)]
*  Those are the same people who demanded vaccine mandates. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=258.66s)]
*  But this happened all over the country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=262.06s)]
*  In Arizona, thousands of enraged rioters tried to storm the state capitol. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  On Friday night, they tore down security fencing around the building. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=267.82s)]
*  They pounded on the Senate's glass doors and windows while the legislature was in session. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  Police had to fire tear gas from the windows to protect the politicians inside. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=276.42s)]
*  Here's what the state capitol of Arizona looked like on Friday. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=281.06s)]
*  Looks like insurrection to us, but no arrests were made at the Arizona state capitol on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=309.1s)]
*  Friday when that footage was shot. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=313.38s)]
*  There will be no FBI investigation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=314.86s)]
*  Democrats who called January 6th the racist insurrection said nothing this weekend about [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  the violent siege of the state capitol of Arizona. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  Did you expect them to? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=325.26000000000005s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=326.26000000000005s)]
*  And in fact, instead, they justified it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=327.26000000000005s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=331.3s)]
*  We have so many problems with the Supreme Court and the legitimacy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=332.3s)]
*  This court has lost legitimacy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=336.94s)]
*  They have burned whatever legitimacy they may still have had. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  This is a crisis of legitimacy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=343.64s)]
*  And that threatens the court's long term legitimacy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=345.9s)]
*  The court is about to face one of the largest threats to perceive legitimacy ever in its [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  history. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=353.14s)]
*  The Supreme Court has lost legitimacy with the American people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=354.14s)]
*  The crisis of the very legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court fills me with [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=357.08s)]
*  sorrow. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=364.8s)]
*  Well, you've got to give them credit for all being on the same page as usual. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=365.8s)]
*  We'd love to get the conference code to the morning call where they set that up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=370.56s)]
*  But because the court did something they don't like, they're not telling us the third branch [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=375.88s)]
*  of government is, quote, illegitimate. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=379.96s)]
*  Supreme Court is illegitimate because it's allowing voters to decide what they want to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=382.88s)]
*  do with abortion. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=387.28s)]
*  Some will call that democracy a system in which citizens choose their own form of government. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=389.84s)]
*  They're telling us it's illegitimate. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=395.84s)]
*  On Sunday, the unelected governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, explained that without nine [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=398.52s)]
*  members of the Supreme Court dictating the law for hundreds of millions of Americans, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=403.68s)]
*  women are fundamentally oppressed. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=408.56s)]
*  Because we're going to get a flood of people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  I have declared this as our safe harbor. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  This is where we have the Statue of Liberty welcoming people who are oppressed, women [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=416.24s)]
*  who cannot receive fundamental right to control their body or receive an abortion. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=420.48s)]
*  They are oppressed. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  They're welcome here in the state of New York. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  So we could go on and on and play you absurd soundbite after absurd soundbite. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  But what are we seeing here? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not simply an attack, an explicit attack on the legitimacy of the third branch of government, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=435.16s)]
*  it's not just an attack on the right of people to govern themselves. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=441.44s)]
*  It's something bigger than that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=445.88s)]
*  What you're seeing is a coordinated attack on the family and on children. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=447.0s)]
*  People at these protests are angered at the idea that children are being born. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=454.52s)]
*  Watch what's happening there. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=462.44s)]
*  That is hardly an overstatement. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=463.52s)]
*  Here's a photograph on your screen from this weekend. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=465.8s)]
*  It was taken outside the Supreme Court. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=468.6s)]
*  It shows a mother humiliating her children in public, implying they are a burden to her [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=470.16s)]
*  because they are still living. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=475.36s)]
*  We saw things like this everywhere at pro-abortion protests, often in full view of children. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  This was the scene, for example, in Dallas this weekend. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=483.88000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  So, what is that exactly? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=500.16s)]
*  What about the thought of having children makes these people so angry? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=507.0s)]
*  Where does an attitude like that come from? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=512.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, as it turns out, that attitude comes from the same place the Democratic Party now [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=514.28s)]
*  gets all of its attitudes, directly from corporate America. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  Corporate America wants you childless. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=523.84s)]
*  This is a big change. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=526.0s)]
*  100 years ago, big companies built housing for the families of their employees and then [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=527.84s)]
*  schools and libraries to educate them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=531.2s)]
*  It was the humane thing to do, but it also seemed to make good business sense at the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=533.88s)]
*  time. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=536.96s)]
*  If you wanted workers you could count on, you had to take care of them and their offspring. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=537.96s)]
*  But over time, that arrangement got expensive. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=543.36s)]
*  Employees with families demanded higher wages to support their children, and in many cases, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=546.12s)]
*  they formed unions to get those raises. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=550.36s)]
*  So labor cost soared. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=553.02s)]
*  So corporate America, in response to this, developed a new model, hire single women. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=555.04s)]
*  At many big companies, including in the traditionally male banking sector, young women now make [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=559.76s)]
*  up the majority of new employees, and you can see why they do. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=563.8s)]
*  They work hard, they're reliable, they tend to be loyal to the companies they work for. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=567.04s)]
*  The one downside to hiring young women is they can get pregnant. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=571.52s)]
*  If you're running the HR department at Citibank, that is the last thing you want. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=576.24s)]
*  Children make your health care plan more expensive. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  Worse than that, they tend to compete with an employee's attention. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=583.76s)]
*  Responding to after work emails seems less pressing to most new moms than putting their [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  own kids to bed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=591.04s)]
*  That's a huge problem for big companies. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=593.04s)]
*  So they have every incentive to prevent their workers from having children. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=594.92s)]
*  I can't say that out loud, of course, it would be too obvious. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=599.08s)]
*  Give us the best years of your life and in exchange, we'll pay you what's effectively [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=602.64s)]
*  a subsistence wage and whatever overpriced urban hellscape we're based in, and then take [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=606.38s)]
*  from you the one thing that might give your existence meaning and joy in middle age, which [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=610.76s)]
*  is having children. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=615.0s)]
*  That's the deal we're offering. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=616.32s)]
*  That is the deal they're offering, but they can't say that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=618.36s)]
*  It would sound like what it is, which is exploitation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=621.08s)]
*  No better than what the cotton mills once did to 14-year-old girls. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=624.2s)]
*  So instead of saying that, which is the truth, corporate America uses the language of the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  social movement it created, feminism, to spin the entire arrangement as some sort of progressive [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=632.48s)]
*  liberation movement. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=638.0600000000001s)]
*  Fight the patriarchy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  It's got nothing to do with lowering our labor costs, we promise. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=641.4s)]
*  But of course it does have everything to do with lowering their labor costs. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  Across the country, they are making that case, abortion as liberation. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=649.68s)]
*  Many of the biggest American companies are now paying female employees to have abortions, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=654.28s)]
*  to end their pregnancies. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  That would include Microsoft, and Apple, Facebook, Yelp, Netflix, Comcast, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  JP Morgan, Nike, Starbucks, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=666.64s)]
*  Dick's Sporting Goods is offering female employees up to $4,000 if they get an abortion. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=670.64s)]
*  Does the company offer the same amount to female employees who want to have children? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, the editors at Breitbart wondered that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=680.72s)]
*  They asked Dick's Sporting Goods that question, but the company didn't even respond. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=683.36s)]
*  And that tells you the answer. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=688.4s)]
*  What's amazing is that in the face of this, so many Americans who ought to know better [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  have fallen for it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=695.76s)]
*  So some accountant at a soulless publicly traded corporation concludes that drones with [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=697.76s)]
*  no personal lives make cheaper workers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=702.2399999999999s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  But rather than question this or resist it, your average college-educated NPR listener [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  nods in vigorous bovine agreement and then becomes completely hysterical when someone [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=712.12s)]
*  suggests that maybe there's another way to live. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=717.2199999999999s)]
*  That it's at least theoretically possible that raising your own children might be more [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=721.0799999999999s)]
*  rewarding as a life choice than commuting into a slum on public transportation in order [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  to claw your way up to middle management at Deutsche Bank. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=729.96s)]
*  But the very thought of that, of turning down Deutsche Bank to bring new life into the world, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=733.92s)]
*  drives these people into a frenzy of rage. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=738.48s)]
*  Choosing a family over service to global capitalism? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=742.0s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=744.36s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=745.36s)]
*  Journalist Drew Hernandez ran into people like this over the weekend. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=747.48s)]
*  Here's how it went. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=750.6s)]
*  David, it's not allowed until it takes its first breath! [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=752.08s)]
*  No! [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=756.08s)]

*  No, I did not have a f***ing conversation. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=776.08s)]
*  Calm down, calm down. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=778.08s)]

*  What's wrong, sir? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  You like killing babies? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  You love killing babies? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=789.2s)]
*  I f***ing love killing babies. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaA1a4GUF4&t=790.2s)]
