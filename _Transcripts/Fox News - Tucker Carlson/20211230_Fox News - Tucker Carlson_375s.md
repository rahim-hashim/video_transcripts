# Say goodbye to the worst mayor in American history: Duffy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI)
*  Now, tomorrow is the end of an era. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the eve of new beginnings. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=2.0s)]
*  Now, just after the ball drops in Times Square tomorrow night, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=4.16s)]
*  a new day begins. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=7.0s)]
*  Now, we're not talking about New Year's. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the end of Bill de Blasio [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=10.34s)]
*  as mayor of New York City. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=12.5s)]
*  So, undoubtedly, the worst mayor in American history. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=14.0s)]
*  So, tonight, we say goodbye to Bill de Blasio. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=17.34s)]
*  Now, Bill de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr., [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  and he did what no other mayor dreamed possible. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=23.88s)]
*  In just a few short years, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=26.66s)]
*  he has completely ruined New York City. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=28.22s)]
*  By almost every measure, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=30.98s)]
*  he has been a complete and utter disaster. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=32.62s)]
*  So, since Bill de Blasio took over, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=36.06s)]
*  murders in New York City have spiked by nearly 50%. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=38.12s)]
*  Rape are up by 26%. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=41.36s)]
*  According to a report by Busby, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=43.5s)]
*  which looked at data from the American Housing Survey, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=45.3s)]
*  along with other federal data, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=48.06s)]
*  New York City is by far the dirtiest city in the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=49.7s)]
*  New York City also had more than 2 million homes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=53.34s)]
*  with pest infestations, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=58.14s)]
*  which include rats, roaches, and mice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=59.7s)]
*  A state audit confirmed the filth, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=63.5s)]
*  with most inspected city blocks and sidewalks [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=65.44s)]
*  found to be dirty, so it's confirmed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=68.44s)]
*  So, under Bill de Blasio, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=70.74s)]
*  New York City transit is disgusting, too. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=71.74s)]
*  According to internal mass transit authority documents [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=74.52s)]
*  released earlier this year, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=77.16s)]
*  subway cars have been soiled with blood, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=78.76s)]
*  vomit, urine, and feces. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=81.68s)]
*  In June of this year, for example, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=84.72s)]
*  there were over 130 incidents of soiled train cars. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=86.58s)]
*  That included 27 trains covered in poop, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=90.68s)]
*  26 covered in vomit, and 21 in urine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=93.56s)]
*  When Bill de Blasio hilariously tried to run for president, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=97.56s)]
*  this show was one of the first to challenge him on that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=100.92s)]
*  The city is dirty, and it's getting dirtier. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=104.16s)]
*  One of my producers told me just yesterday [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=106.94s)]
*  that he was in a crowded subway car [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=108.84s)]
*  and a man dropped his trousers [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=110.2s)]
*  and defecated in the middle of the car, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  and no one did anything about it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=113.18s)]
*  And that's a metaphor for what's happening. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  I go there regularly, and I have my whole life, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=116.46s)]
*  and every time I go, under your mayorship, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=119.14s)]
*  it is dirtier, there's filth on the sidewalks. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  Do you notice any of that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  You weakened the sanction against public urination. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=125.38s)]
*  We believe in this city. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  As a result, the city smells like urine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=128.98s)]
*  No. Do you notice that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  Tucker, it's just not true. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=131.94s)]
*  I go all over New York City all the time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=133.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. I've been here for decades and decades. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=135.26s)]
*  This city is more orderly and cleaner and safer [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=138.26s)]
*  than it's been for many, many years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=141.7s)]
*  We've got more to do, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=143.66s)]
*  and we're going to keep making it better. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=144.74s)]
*  So Bill de Blasio hasn't done anything to fix the filth. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=147.66s)]
*  He doesn't even seem interested. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=150.58s)]
*  Instead, he's too busy erasing history. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=152.18s)]
*  Bill de Blasio supported the removal [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  of the Teddy Roosevelt statue [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=156.94s)]
*  outside New York City's American Museum of Natural History, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=158.5s)]
*  which is a museum Roosevelt's family helped found. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=162.46s)]
*  In his last few months in office, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=166.06s)]
*  he helped remove a statue of Thomas Jefferson [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=167.74s)]
*  from the City Hall, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=170.5s)]
*  where it stood for the last 187 years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  It's no wonder that hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=175.5s)]
*  have fled the city, and that was even before COVID. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  The city's population dropped by over 200,000 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=180.82s)]
*  from 2017 to 2018, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=184.26s)]
*  which at the time was the largest drop since the 70s. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  Over 300,000 have fled between March and October [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=190.42s)]
*  of this year alone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=193.66s)]
*  Former President Trump, he summed it up best. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=195.42s)]
*  Bill de Blasio is a joke. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=198.26s)]
*  Mayor Bill de Blasio taking questions for the first time [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=201.22s)]
*  as a presidential candidate, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=203.82s)]
*  already trading jabs with Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=205.3s)]
*  De Blasio responding to the president [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=207.66s)]
*  who made his feelings known on Twitter, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=209.5s)]
*  calling de Blasio the worst mayor in the US, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=211.5s)]
*  adding, he is a joke, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=214.54s)]
*  but if you like high taxes and crime, he's your man. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=216.14s)]
*  NYC hates him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=219.3s)]
*  And as for the voters who know him best [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=220.98s)]
*  right here in New York City, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=223.02s)]
*  a recent Quinnipiac poll shows 76% of them [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=224.54s)]
*  say he shouldn't run. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=227.5s)]
*  So during his failed run for president, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=230.5s)]
*  de Blasio cost taxpayers $320,000 [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=232.22s)]
*  by using the NYPD as security detail. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=235.74s)]
*  Now, he still hasn't paid that back [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=238.54s)]
*  and his office hasn't said if he ever will. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  That's in addition to the $850 million taxpayer dollars [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=243.22s)]
*  de Blasio's wife supposedly lost track of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=247.26s)]
*  while overseeing her Thrive NYC mental health scheme. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=249.98s)]
*  So these are just a few of the reasons why [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=254.18s)]
*  we'll be happy to see Bill de Blasio leave. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=256.34s)]
*  But before we celebrate the end of Bill de Blasio, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=259.5s)]
*  we would be remiss if we didn't look back [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=261.86s)]
*  at some of his greatest hits. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=264.38s)]
*  Now we're gonna start with the rough beginning [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=265.82s)]
*  when his clumsiness killed Chuck the Groundhog. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=267.82s)]
*  This footage from Groundhog Day 2014 [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=271.18s)]
*  shows freshly inaugurated mayor Bill de Blasio [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=273.38s)]
*  appearing to drop Staten Island Chuck. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=276.14s)]
*  A week after the de Blasio fumble, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=278.86s)]
*  the Groundhog did a few more events [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=280.7s)]
*  before being found in its zoo space [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=282.66s)]
*  deceased on February 9th. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=284.42s)]
*  So Bill de Blasio slopping us in there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  Then there was the time he tweeted [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=289.7s)]
*  and then deleted a picture of himself [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=291.29999999999995s)]
*  staring at a woman's chest. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=293.61999999999995s)]
*  Now we're not kidding. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=295.73999999999995s)]
*  His line of sight was so clearly visible [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=296.9s)]
*  in the reflection of his sunglasses. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=298.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, or how could we forget when he sounded [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=300.73999999999995s)]
*  like a chipmunk at a campaign rally? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=303.38s)]
*  We're doing something that should have been done [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  a long time ago in this country. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=307.34s)]
*  We're passing legislation this year [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=308.5s)]
*  to guarantee working people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=310.7s)]
*  like every other industrialized country in the world, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=312.05999999999995s)]
*  to guarantee working people by law, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYXNkDy1qiI&t=313.94s)]
