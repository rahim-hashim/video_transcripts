# Feminist rips 'gender identity' as meaningless
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg)
*  So remember a few years ago they started to tell us that actually sex differences weren't real [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=0.0s)]
*  and you thought to yourself, well I took biology, I know that men and women are physical categories [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=3.52s)]
*  and I am one so I kind of know it's true and they said relax, it's only about being sensitive [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=8.72s)]
*  to a small percentage of the population who are different, you don't want to judge them, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=14.48s)]
*  you're not a bigot are you when you think to yourself, no I'm kind of liberal minded, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I want to bother other people live how they want to live. It's like it's going to affect my life. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=20.56s)]
*  Oh but it is going to affect your life, in fact it's going to reorder society completely. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=25.44s)]
*  Here's the latest example of it. At the University of Pennsylvania a biological man has decided to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  say that he's a woman, he's a swimmer and he's destroyed the women's swimming records, of course [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=37.6s)]
*  because he's a man actually. The swimmer goes by the name of Leah Thomas, competed for three years [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=44.24s)]
*  as a man before he decided to identify as a woman and in a recent women's competition he just won a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  500 yard freestyle by a full 14 seconds. Now if you swim or ever do a swimming 14 seconds, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=53.6s)]
*  that's time enough to get a beer and come back, like there's no 14 second differences between [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=61.92s)]
*  swimmers but there are now. Thomas's closest rival in a longer freestyle race was 38 seconds [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=65.92s)]
*  behind, that's a different country. So one person who actually did predict this at great personal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=72.8s)]
*  cost, she's really hated for saying it but she was right, is Kara Dansky, the author of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=78.96s)]
*  Abolition of Sex, the president of the U.S. chapter of the Women's Human Rights Campaign, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  longtime card-carrying member of the American left but a very brave person, Kara Dansky joins [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=88.16s)]
*  us tonight. Kara thanks so much for coming on, you must feel a little vindicated because when we first [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  started having these conversations years ago you predicted things like this and people attacked you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=96.72s)]
*  for being crazy. Thank you so much for having me and yes, I mean a lot of us saw this coming down [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=101.76s)]
*  the pike, there's a woman named Beth Stelzer who founded an organization called Save Women's Sports [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=109.92s)]
*  several years ago, she's going to be speaking with your colleague Laura Ingraham later tonight, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=114.64s)]
*  many of us saw this coming and it's just very important that we all understand that situations [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=118.64s)]
*  like what we're seeing in Pennsylvania at the University of Pennsylvania are not anomalous, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  this is happening all over the country as I know you know. Well it's just amazing that people put [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=128.96s)]
*  up with it, I mean if you've been a swimmer, had kids who swim 38 seconds doesn't happen [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  in competitive swimming, that's not even, that's a different sport so this is totally upended a sport [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=140.56s)]
*  that we've had for you know over 100 years in this country, where are all the parents, the coaches, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=146.24s)]
*  the swimmers, like why is anybody saying anything? A lot of people are saying things, a lot of parents [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  are speaking out, I think a lot of students are very scared of speaking out because saying look, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=156.08s)]
*  this isn't appropriate, we shouldn't have men competing in women's sports is a very unpopular [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=161.12s)]
*  thing to say, the other thing I just want to say is very often this is framed as having so-called [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  transgender athletes participating in women's sports and I really want us to get away from [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=170.8s)]
*  that language, the truth of the matter is that he is a man and he's been allowed to compete in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  women's sports, part of the problem is that a lot of this is happening because of a series of orders [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=180.8s)]
*  that the Biden administration issued over the course of the first six months of the administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=186.0s)]
*  impacting Title IX among other federal administrative laws and it essentially says that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=190.96s)]
*  throughout federal administrative law the word sex has to be redefined to include the words [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=197.28s)]
*  gender identity and that is a disaster for women and girls including the women who are on the UPenn [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=203.68s)]
*  women's swimming team. Yeah well it just eliminates women and girls as a meaningful category like they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=210.16s)]
*  don't exist anymore so how can you undo this? I mean let's be honest you cover this stuff, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=214.72s)]
*  I'm from Washington, like you change something like that no one ever changes it back right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=219.6s)]
*  Well so there is currently a lawsuit pending that was filed by 20 states and I'm proud to say that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=227.04s)]
*  the U.S. chapter of the women's human rights campaign submitted a brief in that case arguing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=231.84s)]
*  that redefining sex to include the nebulous nonsensical concept of gender identity also [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=236.4s)]
*  constitutes sex discrimination and so I'm very happy to be involved in that lawsuit but I also [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=243.28s)]
*  just want to note that what I unpack in the book shows that this goes far beyond sports so we're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=248.08s)]
*  seeing for example and we've talked about this before too states like California, Washington and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=255.04s)]
*  other states across the country are allowing convicted male rapists and murderers to be housed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=260.8s)]
*  in women's prisons on the basis of their so-called gender identity. We're seeing the total invasion [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=266.16s)]
*  of women's spaces, prisons, bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms and sports by men on the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=272.4s)]
*  basis of their so-called female gender identity and what I really want everyone to understand [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=280.32s)]
*  is that words like gender identity don't have any meaning, they really don't. I mean they're [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=286.32s)]
*  defined variously, inconsistently and vaguely in ways that don't make any sense. Every single [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  human being is either a male person or a female person, everything else is a lie. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=299.76s)]
*  Man, if you ever have an hour I'd love to sit down and just hear what your life has been like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=306.32s)]
*  since you started saying obvious truths like that on television. I think you paid a big cost, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=309.84s)]
*  I would love to hear about it at some point. Anyway, in the meantime, thank you. Well if I [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=314.32s)]
*  could just make one plea. Yeah. Can I make one plea to your viewers? Of course. Okay, so I have one [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  plea to make which is this, as Tucker knows I'm a registered Democrat as he said in my introduction. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=321.84s)]
*  I have made common cause with many Republicans who are fighting back against so-called gender [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=327.6s)]
*  identity ideology. One thing that has frustrated me is that across the political spectrum people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  still seem to be of the view that the phrase transgender people, the phrase transgender athlete, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  the phrase transgender student, the phrase transgender prisoner has some sort of coherent [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=344.0s)]
*  meaning. It doesn't. And so my plea to your viewers in particular, I know that it's Republicans who [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=349.44s)]
*  are holding the line, I don't like it but I know it's true, Republicans are holding the line on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=354.88s)]
*  material reality, all of that goes out the window when you use a word like transgender. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=359.44s)]
*  You're totally right. It just doesn't exist. And I'm begging viewers to stop using it. Thank you so much. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=365.2s)]
*  So smart. The language matters. Kara Dansky, thank you so much. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QmLFtUemg&t=368.96s)]
