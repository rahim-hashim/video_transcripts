# Ron Johnson responds to hometown newspaper calling him an election denier
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo)
*  Here's Joe Biden claiming that Democrats don't question election results. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a nation that believes in the rule of law. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=4.16s)]
*  We do not repudiate it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=8.68s)]
*  This is a nation that respects free and fair elections. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=11.68s)]
*  We honor the will of the people. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=14.84s)]
*  We do not deny it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=16.92s)]
*  We do not deny it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=18.92s)]
*  Unless of course two weeks out from a pivotal midterm election we get the sense based on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=22.8s)]
*  polling that we're about to be spanked like the bad little girls we are at which point [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=26.48s)]
*  we start making excuses and planting the seeds for more election denial just as we did after [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=30.28s)]
*  Donald Trump won. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=35.72s)]
*  That's exactly what's going on now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=37.36s)]
*  Even as they try to destroy the careers and tear down the character of people who ask [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=39.72s)]
*  honest questions about the last election. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=45.22s)]
*  That would include Ron Johnson, who is the senator from Wisconsin, the Republican, one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  of the very few Republicans in the entire U.S. Senate who has actually improved every [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=53.68s)]
*  year that he served there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=57.24s)]
*  That's the opposite of the normal progression for Republicans in the Senate in case you [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=58.4s)]
*  haven't noticed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=61.68s)]
*  Now, Ron Johnson is running against someone who's legitimately far out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=62.68s)]
*  His name is Mandela Barnes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=66.08s)]
*  On Twitter, Barnes once rang in the new year by praising, and few politicians do this, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=67.92s)]
*  by praising Iran's Ayatollah because he supports BLM. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=72.28s)]
*  I'm work quoting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=77.72s)]
*  The first tweet of 2015 from at Kameni IR is Black Lives Matter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=78.72s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=84.36s)]
*  May this be a most wonderful year for you and yours, Barnes wrote. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=85.36s)]
*  So he's got the Ayatollah vote. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=90.16s)]
*  Barnes also wants to abolish ICE, defund the police, and end cash bail. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=91.84s)]
*  So that would result in further chaos and the total destruction of American society. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=96.4s)]
*  Might be worth following up on that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=100.4s)]
*  I know the media in Wisconsin are still talking about Ron Johnson's election denial. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=102.36s)]
*  Here's his hometown newspaper, which no one reads in fairness, attacking him the other [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=107.52s)]
*  day for it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=111.76s)]
*  Quote, election deceiver, science fabulist, billionaire benefactor. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=112.76s)]
*  After 12 years, it's time to turn limit Senator Ron Johnson. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=116.88s)]
*  So again, just to be clear, Democrats are sending people to prison for questioning the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  last election, trying to prevent people from getting elected in the midterm election for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=125.6s)]
*  questioning the last election, while at the very same time telling you that the 2016 election [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=129.68s)]
*  was rigged, the midterm will likely be rigged, and we know for a fact the 2024 election is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=134.68s)]
*  not on the level. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=139.72s)]
*  How does this work exactly? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=140.72s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson joins us tonight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=145.6s)]
*  Is it a little weird to be attacked by your hometown newspapers and election denier on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=148.48s)]
*  the very same day with the people who run the Democratic Party are preemptively denying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=152.88s)]
*  the outcome of an election that hasn't even happened yet? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=157.28s)]
*  Well, hello, Tucker. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=159.28s)]
*  Those are some of the better headlines I received from the mainstream media here in Wisconsin. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=162.44s)]
*  Let's face it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=167.8s)]
*  What is happening here is a classic tactic of the left. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=169.0s)]
*  Falsely accuse your political opponents of doing exactly what you do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=173.36s)]
*  Let's face it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  How many leading Democrats said that the 2016 election was legitimate? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  No, they spent four years trying to overturn it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=183.56s)]
*  They corrupt FBI investigation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=186.76s)]
*  And it was the complicit and corrupt media that allowed all this to go on. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=188.6s)]
*  They were fed all the false information. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=194.06s)]
*  Why haven't they exposed the people that fed them false information? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  What about the 570 riots during the summer of 2020? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  Two thousand law enforcement officers injured, one to two billion dollars worth of property [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=204.76s)]
*  damage, a couple dozen people killed, including two people here in Kenosha. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=208.76s)]
*  Why don't they talk about that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  All they do is focus on January 6th. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=215.4s)]
*  I think this has always been a massive diversionary operation against their or from their own [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=216.96s)]
*  wrongdoing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  So, again, classic classic operation of the left. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a classic tactic. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, they have the complicit and corrupt media this back in a month. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  So you're saying things out loud that you're not supposed to say aloud. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=234.56s)]
*  We interviewed earlier today Dr. Robert Epstein, who is a professor of psychology who studies [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  Google. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=243.36s)]
*  And he told us that he has never seen Google put its sizable thumb on the scale more aggressively [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=244.36s)]
*  than in Wisconsin right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=249.84s)]
*  That Google is trying to lose you the race and get Mandela Barnes elected because they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=251.36s)]
*  so threatened by the things that you are saying. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  Are you aware of this and what's your response to it? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=261.04s)]
*  No, I'm fully aware. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=263.64s)]
*  I know of his work. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  He's talking about how Google uses their search to manipulate opinion. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=267.16s)]
*  While they only text, for example, get out the vote to Democrat supporters. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=272.58s)]
*  We saw Mark Zuckerberg use his Zucker bucks completely took over the Green Bay election [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=277.85999999999996s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  And yet this is the safest, most secure election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  Of course it wasn't. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=286.5s)]
*  There were all kinds of irregularities. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=287.5s)]
*  I held a hearing in December of 2020 because I was not going to scornfully dismiss the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=288.5s)]
*  legitimate concerns of tens of millions of Americans because observers weren't able [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=293.17999999999995s)]
*  to observe. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=298.02s)]
*  Here in Wisconsin, there were we had a legislative audit bureau, nonpartisan, bipartisan audit [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=299.06s)]
*  of our election. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  Thirty one recommendations because things went wrong. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  We had our Wisconsin Election Commission issue guidance that's contrary to state law. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=308.58s)]
*  Election clerks, procedures contrary to state law. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=313.52s)]
*  And yet we're all supposed to say, oh, no, it's the most secure election. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=316.02s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  And they absolutely hate you for saying that out loud. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=322.06s)]
*  And that's why we're certainly rooting for you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, good luck in that race. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=327.3s)]
*  Have a good night. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yAOzAnaAzo&t=331.78000000000003s)]
