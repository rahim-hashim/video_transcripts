# Tucker astounded by reason conservative satire site was fact-checked
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o)
*  So the Babylon Bee is hugely successful because it's great. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=0.0s)]
*  It's one of the few remaining amusing sites on the internet. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  It's really smart. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=7.2s)]
*  So of course, Big Tech hates it and is trying to censor it [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=8.4s)]
*  and prevent people from reading it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=12.0s)]
*  Seth Dillon is the CEO of the Babylon Bee, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=13.6s)]
*  is a very successful business man, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=16.0s)]
*  but he probably spends all his time just trying to keep his voice from being stifled. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=17.3s)]
*  Seth, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=21.1s)]
*  So what is, I know you've been involved in these battles [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=22.6s)]
*  probably every day for months now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=26.2s)]
*  What are the attempts now to shut you guys down? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=28.8s)]
*  Where do I begin? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=32.8s)]
*  I mean, it starts with misinformation, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=33.8s)]
*  I mean, we've been fact-checked to death over and over again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=36.2s)]
*  It started out with this fact-check about CNN purchasing an industrial-sized washing machine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=39.5s)]
*  so they could spin the news before publication, you know, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=44.4s)]
*  and it's just been on and on and on from there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=46.6s)]
*  We get fact-checked to death. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Oh, that wasn't real? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=49.2s)]
*  Wasn't real. That was a fake story, believe it or not. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=51.6s)]
*  So, you know, basically the social networks have been using these fact-checkers [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=54.7s)]
*  to, you know, try to, under the guise of like trying to control misinformation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=59.2s)]
*  It's politically motivated, has been the whole time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=64.8s)]
*  And we're seeing, like right now, we're seeing a drastic drop in traffic, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=67.6s)]
*  a decline, a steady decline over the course of time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=70.6s)]
*  It started really around the election last year, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=72.7s)]
*  well, but leading into the 2020 election. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=75.9s)]
*  And it's just been this steady decline, rapid decline. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=78.9s)]
*  We used to drive most of our traffic through Facebook. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=81.2s)]
*  We now drive very little of our traffic through Facebook. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=83.2s)]
*  Articles that used to go crazy viral, you repost them now, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=85.8s)]
*  they get like barely any shares at all. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  I joked recently, like one of the articles that we shared, it reached 11 people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=91.4s)]
*  We have over a million people in our audience. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=95.2s)]
*  It reached 11 people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=96.8s)]
*  We could have reached more people if we printed it out [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=97.8s)]
*  and like nailed it to like a telephone pole in a small town. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=100.0s)]
*  I mean, Facebook now or the social media companies are specifically going against satire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  Like they're basically saying humor is no longer allowed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=110.8s)]
*  and they're saying it explicitly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=113.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, okay. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  So they've made new rules, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=117.2s)]
*  They have new rules that they're rolling out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  They've got this new policy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=119.8s)]
*  Satire is allowed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=121.0s)]
*  They're going to allow satire, but there's a catch. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=122.1s)]
*  You can't punch down. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=124.6s)]
*  No punching down is allowed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=126.2s)]
*  So they've got this new thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=127.9s)]
*  And how you define punch down, punching down, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=129.6s)]
*  I mean, look, it's like they have all these protected things, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=131.6s)]
*  these sacred cows that they don't want you to joke about. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=133.8s)]
*  They want to control your speech and control what you joke about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=135.9s)]
*  And I think it's the most condescending thing ever. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=138.4s)]
*  I mean, imagine thinking to yourself, I can't joke about those people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=140.3s)]
*  They're beneath me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, how condescending is that to have that thought go through your head? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  We're not allowed to joke about women [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  because joking about women would be considered punching down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  It would be hate speech under the guise of satire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  I don't think women are beneath me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  So I reject the whole premise that, you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  there's this that there's it's even possible to really punch down at people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=157.5s)]
*  who aren't beneath me to begin with, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=160.3s)]
*  but they just perpetuate those stereotypes by enforcing rules like this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=161.8s)]
*  And it's really just aimed at curbing and silencing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  and ostracizing satire comedy and thinkers that they don't like. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=168.6s)]
*  If you're regulating humor, you're I mean, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=172.4s)]
*  you're kind of East Germany at that point, aren't you? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=178.4s)]
*  Look, putting putting your rulers up to it, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=180.4s)]
*  that's the whole point of satire, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  It's to it's to punch up. It's to speak truth to power. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=185.2s)]
*  You know, tyrants don't like that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  It's the thing that they hate more than anything else. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=190.4s)]
*  So, you know, the fact that they're coming out after us, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=192.7s)]
*  we're actually not punching down. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=195.2s)]
*  We are punching up. Most of the ideas we go after are progressive ideas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=196.5s)]
*  They're popular ideas. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=200.1s)]
*  They're advanced by celebrities, corporations, politicians. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=201.1s)]
*  They're coming from the top down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=204.1s)]
*  We're punching back. We're punching back. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=205.6s)]
*  We're not punching down. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=207.1s)]
*  If anybody is fighting the power, it's the Babylon B. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=208.4s)]
*  And you will succeed in the end because you're smart. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=211.4s)]
*  And we're rooting for you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=214.4s)]
*  Seth, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=215.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=217.8s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFwBkIWN8o&t=226.5s)]
