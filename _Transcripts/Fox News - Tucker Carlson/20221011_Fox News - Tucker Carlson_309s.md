# Candace Owens reacts to firestorm over wearing White Lives Matter shirt
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M)
*  Kanye West, now, yay, was not the only person [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=0.0s)]
*  wearing a White Lives Matter T-shirt [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=3.4s)]
*  at the Paris Fashion Week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  His friend and our friend, Candace Owens, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=7.76s)]
*  was standing right next to him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=9.36s)]
*  So we asked West what that whole thing was like, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=12.58s)]
*  and here's what he told us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=15.48s)]
*  The more and more I lean into God and work for God, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  the more wins God is gonna bestow on our team, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=21.96s)]
*  on Jesus' gang. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=26.16s)]
*  And for me to go out and just state an obvious [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=27.88s)]
*  and empathetic statement in the middle of the most liberal, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=33.22s)]
*  central, like, to go, that was like Tiananmen Square [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=38.84s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=41.56s)]
*  I was like, with Candace Owens, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=42.56s)]
*  and we both wore the shirt at the same time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=45.68s)]
*  You know, we got some Jesus soldiers out here, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=49.56s)]
*  and people say they're willing to die for it, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=53.8s)]
*  but we live for it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=56.88s)]
*  We're living for the battle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  And what's the battle for? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=61.24s)]
*  Life itself, our children. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=62.28s)]
*  Like Tiananmen Square, yay West, Candace Owens [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=65.84s)]
*  standing there in front of the tank, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=69.4s)]
*  which is international media. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=70.88s)]
*  Candace Owens is the host of the podcast, Candace, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=74.56s)]
*  and she joins us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=77.44s)]
*  Hey, Candace, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=78.28s)]
*  So why did you do that? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=79.6s)]
*  You did it together. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  And what do you think of the response? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  Why can't you do that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=86.56s)]
*  Well, I just want to say it was one of the only weeks [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  that I missed doing your show. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=91.76s)]
*  And the only reason I would miss doing your show, Tucker, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=92.92s)]
*  is because I knew that there was a cultural moment [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=95.44s)]
*  that would be so significant as this was. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=97.92s)]
*  You know, I did it because Kanye called me [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  and he said that he needed me to be there at the show [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=102.14s)]
*  and he needed me to be a part of the show. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=104.92s)]
*  And when he told me what he had in mind [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=107.0s)]
*  and wearing these t-shirts, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=109.04s)]
*  which by the way, he told me the day of, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=110.2s)]
*  I instantly understood what he was trying to do [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=112.9s)]
*  and what the artistic expression was. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=115.22s)]
*  What it offered was a stunning commentary [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=117.14s)]
*  on the hypocrisy of the society that we live in. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=119.42s)]
*  For years, we were told that Black Lives Matter [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=121.94s)]
*  was not an exclusionary phrase. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=124.42s)]
*  We were told that it's just what we're saying. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=126.38s)]
*  We're not trying to leave white people out, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=128.38s)]
*  We're just saying this because this is a moment [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=130.7s)]
*  that black Americans need to have in this country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=132.64s)]
*  They were totally fine when Asian Lives Matter [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=135.26s)]
*  became a slogan as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=137.1s)]
*  Asians, by the way, are doing better in this country [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=138.42s)]
*  economically than white Americans. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=140.54s)]
*  They're more successful in education as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=141.98s)]
*  And they're more likely to get credit cards [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=144.22s)]
*  as just one example. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=146.3s)]
*  And yet despite all of that, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=147.66s)]
*  it was okay to say Asian Lives Matter. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=148.94s)]
*  We put on a t-shirt to actually do something [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=150.72s)]
*  that was inclusive, to say, actually white Americans, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=152.84s)]
*  you are allowed to be a part of this too [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  because literally all lives matter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=157.5s)]
*  And in fact, no lives have been mattering. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=159.62s)]
*  Black Americans are suffering as a result [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=162.18s)]
*  because of Black Lives Matter. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  We know that their neighborhoods have been rioted [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=165.3s)]
*  in inner city communities [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=167.5s)]
*  and the businesses are moving out of there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  The result of Black Lives Matter has been white supremacy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=170.24s)]
*  Assuming that black Americans were stupid and emotional [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=172.94s)]
*  and would loot and riot their own communities [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=175.5s)]
*  to fulfill a false narrative about policing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=178.46s)]
*  And so we got to say all of that by wearing one t-shirt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=180.7s)]
*  It's just so interesting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=185.06s)]
*  I mean, if you're triggered, as they say, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=186.34s)]
*  by a shirt like that, no one who is mad about it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  ever seemed to ask like, why? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  If it said Malaysian Lives Matter or anybody, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=193.3s)]
*  you would, a normal person would say, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=197.46s)]
*  well, of course all lives matter, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=198.78s)]
*  but like, why does this make them so mad? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=200.54s)]
*  It's weird and dark. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=202.98s)]
*  It makes them so mad because there is actually [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=204.7s)]
*  in this country, a hatred toward white people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=207.9s)]
*  It is undeniable. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=210.7s)]
*  The worst thing that you can be in this country, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  far from what they're telling you, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  I would say two things. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  First and foremost, a black child in the womb of its mother. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  That is the most unsafe place for a black child to be. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=218.06s)]
*  The second thing is a white straight male, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=220.34s)]
*  Because they perceive that as being too normal, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=222.72s)]
*  It's too normal for you to be a white straight male. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  You need to make yourself somehow problematized [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=227.38s)]
*  by saying that you're trans, that you're suffering, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=229.6s)]
*  that you're gay, that you're Hispanic, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=231.48s)]
*  that you have a biracial mother, something. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=233.28s)]
*  People are dying to say that they're anything [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=235.92s)]
*  but being white. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  And again, that is the commentary that we offer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=239.04s)]
*  by wearing these shirts. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=241.06s)]
*  You actually cannot, right now, today on TikTok, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=242.24s)]
*  you cannot use the hashtag white lives matter [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=245.12s)]
*  because they say that it inspires hatred. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=247.44s)]
*  And in fact, banning the hashtag white lives matter [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=249.72s)]
*  is what inspires hatred. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=252.12s)]
*  The saddest part of this Tucker, which I wanna add, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  is that after wearing the shirt [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=255.6s)]
*  and getting back here down in Tennessee, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=256.76s)]
*  I went to a farmer's market [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=258.04s)]
*  and I had white people coming up to me [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=260.12s)]
*  with tears in their eyes. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And I told Kanye this, tears in their eyes saying, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=261.8s)]
*  thank you so much as if they're the forgotten people [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  for just allowing us to have our voices back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=266.04s)]
*  They've been sitting in silence, completely sidelined, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=268.2s)]
*  told that they are not allowed to be American [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=270.48s)]
*  because there's a vicious narrative around [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  that somehow black Americans are suffering from policing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=274.04s)]
*  and therefore white lives can't matter. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=276.76s)]
*  They do, it's obvious, Kanye was correct. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=278.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why people put up with it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=281.92s)]
*  I mean, no group, no group, no matter what they look like [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  or what they believe should put up with being singled out [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMe-8H921M&t=286.16s)]
