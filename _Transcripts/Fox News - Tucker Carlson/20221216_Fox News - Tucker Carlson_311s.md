# Tucker: What could the government be hiding about the JFK assassination?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8)
*  We asked Pompeo to join us tonight, and though he really turns down a televised interview, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=0.0s)]
*  he refused to come. We hope he will reconsider. In the meantime, we are happy to be joined tonight [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=4.0s)]
*  by New York Post columnist Miranda Devine. Miranda, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=8.88s)]
*  I don't think we've paused long enough to consider what this means. After 60 years, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=12.4s)]
*  when every person involved is dead, we can't see classified information about maybe the pivotal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=17.6s)]
*  event in modern American history. And now we know why. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=25.28s)]
*  Well, Tucker, look, you laid it out really well. And, you know, it used to be that conservatives [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=32.4s)]
*  like me dismissed theories from the left about JFK's assassination as just left-wing conspiracy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=39.2s)]
*  theories. But over time, I think that the left looks as if they were quite justified [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=48.0s)]
*  in not trusting the intelligence services. And I think the WMD pretext for the Iraq war [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=54.88s)]
*  was a red pill, a slowly dawning red pill for me. And so now you just have to look just on a really [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  basic level. You just look at the fact that 30 years ago, Congress in a unanimous, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=70.08s)]
*  bipartisan, unequivocal, unambiguous decision said that these, all the JFK files have to be made [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=77.12s)]
*  public. Absolutely no reason to keep them back. As you say, it's almost 60 years ago, everybody [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=85.52s)]
*  involved is dead. You're not worried about sullying reputations or unmasking a spy overseas. No, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=91.2s)]
*  there can only be two reasons for it. One is that you're trying to protect the CIA against [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  allegations or revelations that it knew more than it made out about Lee Harvey Oswald. It had a huge [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  file on him. They were investigating him or in connect, in contact with him before the assassination [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  and they didn't do enough to save JFK or protect the president. But, you know, is that enough to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=122.24s)]
*  really keep this secret going for 60 years? I mean, the terrible dawning recognition is that really, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=129.2s)]
*  this is about, as you said, protecting the institution. If the CIA was involved in that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=137.12s)]
*  assassination, that is the reason that you would want to keep that from the American people, because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=142.64s)]
*  the fury that would erupt, and this is a bipartisan fury, it'd be the one thing that would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=148.16s)]
*  unite Americans, is an absolute rage at this unaccountable spy agency that has decided that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=155.2s)]
*  it is going to get involved in murdering, assassinating the duly elected American president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=164.72s)]
*  For what reason? You know, there would be such a clean out of the CIA. I don't know if it would [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=172.64s)]
*  even survive. And so the trust in our institutions is already at rock bottom. I think it's a mistake [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=178.16s)]
*  for Mike Pompeo not to come on your show, because all this does is fuel more conspiracy theories. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=184.32s)]
*  The truth is the best disinfectant. And if the CIA did do this, was involved 60 years ago, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=191.6s)]
*  then it needs to come clean. We need to have a reckoning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=198.32s)]
*  And just to be clear, that was the assessment of someone we spoke to who was directly and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=202.16s)]
*  personally familiar with the contents of these documents, not someone who read it on the internet. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=207.12s)]
*  This is someone who had access to the documents. And I have to say, I don't understand, and I agree [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=212.4s)]
*  with you, secrecy abets evil. And the more secrecy you have, the more evil you're likely to have. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=217.84s)]
*  So we should minimize the amount of secrecy as a general matter. But I don't understand how [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=222.64s)]
*  John Brennan can go on NBC News every day. He was on today. And no one pauses and asks, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=226.4s)]
*  what is this exactly? 60 years, really? And don't give me the sources in Methods BS, by the way, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=231.04s)]
*  son. We're adults here. What's the real reason? Why does no one ask him that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=236.0s)]
*  Well, the more we see characters from the CIA like John Brennan, like those 51 former intelligence [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=242.0s)]
*  officials who signed that scurrilous letter about Hunter Biden being Russian disinformation, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=248.0s)]
*  the more, the less impressive they look. These people are in the shadows for a reason, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  because if you actually saw who they were, look at John Brennan. Knowing what we know now about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  him, would you really entrust him to run the country's premier spy agency, to have such power [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=264.88s)]
*  to run around the world intervening in other countries' elections? No. So I just don't know [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=273.68s)]
*  what good it does us to have those kind of malevolent people having so much power and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=282.08s)]
*  using it in our name and causing us all great harm because we don't know what they're doing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=287.84s)]
*  That's right. Transparency can fix it. It's the only thing they can. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=293.44s)]
*  And I appreciate your assessment, Lorraine Devine of the New York Post. Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCFr6aR61f8&t=296.15999999999997s)]
