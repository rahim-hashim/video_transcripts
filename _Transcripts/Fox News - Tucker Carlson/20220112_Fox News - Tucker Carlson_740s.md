# Tucker: Here comes Hillary
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=0.0s)]
*  Not trying to be cruel this Wednesday, just reading the numbers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=4.08s)]
*  Joe Biden is the most unpopular president that the United States has had in a very long time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=6.84s)]
*  Voters dislike Kamala Harris even more. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=12.44s)]
*  And that's a problem because this is supposed to be the new administration's honeymoon period, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=15.16s)]
*  the part where everyone thinks they're great. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=19.48s)]
*  So it's not getting better from here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=21.32s)]
*  This is as beloved as the Biden administration is going to get. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=23.56s)]
*  Smart Democrats can read the numbers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=27.96s)]
*  They understand this and they're working on a solution. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=29.4s)]
*  This week, two of them wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal calling on the party to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  support Hillary Clinton for president in 2024. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=35.92s)]
*  Hillary is the best positioned candidate to win a national election, they argued. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=40.12s)]
*  She's also, they noted, younger than Joe Biden. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  Former President Bill Clinton agrees with this or says he does anyway. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=47.84s)]
*  Bill Clinton told People magazine that his wife is, quote, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=51.2s)]
*  the most qualified person to run for office in my lifetime, including me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=54.04s)]
*  In fact, failing to elect Hillary in 2016 was, in Bill Clinton's studied estimation, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=59.08s)]
*  an historic national tragedy, quote, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=64.48s)]
*  one of the most profound mistakes we've ever made. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=66.88s)]
*  Unforgivable, really. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=70.52s)]
*  The good news is we now have a chance to correct that mistake. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=72.4s)]
*  And you don't get those very often in life. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=75.92s)]
*  Typically, when you do something rash or stupid, you've got to live with the consequences. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=78.12s)]
*  It's probably happened to you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=81.64s)]
*  One night you're listening to Born to Run after too many drinks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=83.0s)]
*  The next thing you know, you've got Bruce Springsteen's face tattooed on your lower back. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=85.68s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=89.84s)]
*  It's also permanent. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=91.12s)]
*  Think of Hillary Clinton as America's national tattoo remover. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  She alone can erase the stain of our youthful bad judgment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=96.84s)]
*  God bless that woman. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=99.72000000000001s)]
*  But wait a second, you say. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=101.4s)]
*  Hillary can't win. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=102.4s)]
*  She's yesterday's candidate. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  This country's got a short attention span. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  We want the new, new thing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  And Hillary Clinton isn't new. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=108.84s)]
*  She's been around forever. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  We're bored of her. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you believe that, you don't remember Hillary Clinton very well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=113.76s)]
*  Call her what you will, but she's not boring. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=116.96s)]
*  Hillary's like a box of cracker jacks or your emotionally volatile niece who goes to art school. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=119.12s)]
*  She's full of surprises. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=123.96s)]
*  You never know what you're going to get. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=125.4s)]
*  There are days when Hillary seems like a sensible Midwestern Methodist who grew up Republican [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=128.28s)]
*  in a suburb outside Chicago. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=132.56s)]
*  That's the biographically accurate Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=134.64s)]
*  But it's hardly the only Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=137.84s)]
*  During the years she spent in Arkansas, for example, Hillary often played the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=140.52s)]
*  loyal daughter of the American South, a Southern-fried Dixie lady with a spunky feminist twist. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=143.56s)]
*  That was the character she was portraying when we first met her 30 years ago this month. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=149.72s)]
*  It was during the 1992 presidential primaries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=153.48s)]
*  Listen to her accent here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=156.6s)]
*  You're looking at two people who love each other. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=159.48s)]
*  This is not an arrangement or an understanding. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=161.72s)]
*  This is a marriage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=164.72s)]
*  That's a very different thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=165.72s)]
*  You know, I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=168.32s)]
*  I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him and I honor what he's been through [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=172.76s)]
*  and what we've been through together. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=178.16s)]
*  You don't hear a hint of Parkeridge, Illinois in that voice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=181.0s)]
*  It's all bourbon and okra. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=184.28s)]
*  Pretty impressive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=186.32s)]
*  But that's hardly the only persona in Hillary's quiver. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=187.64s)]
*  She contains multitudes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=191.04s)]
*  When she feels like it, Hillary can transform herself entirely from a middle-aged rich white [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=192.64s)]
*  to a weary but dignified household domestic-turned civil rights protester, bruised and battered [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=198.04s)]
*  from a harrowing march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the road to freedom. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=203.48s)]
*  Sometimes Hillary Clinton is just sick and tired of being sick and tired. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=208.04s)]
*  I don't feel no ways tired. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=212.6s)]
*  I come too far from where I started from. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=215.6s)]
*  Nobody told me that the road would be easy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=220.6s)]
*  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=225.64s)]
*  It's not a bad impression. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=230.64s)]
*  Of course, there are other days when Hillary doesn't talk at all. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=233.64s)]
*  That's in her repertoire too. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=236.56s)]
*  She just points her finger at you and cackles wildly like a mental patient on the subway. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  For the uninitiated, it can be a disconcerting experience. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=242.88s)]
*  Is she casting a spell? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=245.56s)]
*  Is she going to bite me? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=247.28s)]
*  You're never sure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=248.28s)]
*  But her staff isn't worried. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=249.64s)]
*  They think it's all part of her secret sauce. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=250.64s)]
*  It's one of the reasons everyone loves Hillary. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=253.2s)]
*  Here's the cackle routine. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=256.32s)]
*  Wouldn't it be insane of you to run for office again? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=257.32s)]
*  Is she sitting across from me right now? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=262.76s)]
*  I don't know why that's funny. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=265.76s)]
*  Did you have any in-person briefings? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=269.56s)]
*  I don't find it funny at all. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=274.44s)]
*  It is great to have you here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=277.44s)]
*  I'm going to tell you how you really get your damn emails. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=283.48s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who are not. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=287.64s)]
*  Including... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=291.52s)]
*  I mean, really, yes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=292.52s)]
*  It deserves a lot of laughter. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=296.76s)]
*  No, she didn't kill Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=299.84s)]
*  Remember all that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=304.6s)]
*  You're starting to see how the Hillary Clinton phenomenon began in the first place and why [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=305.76s)]
*  it could so easily rekindle. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=310.12s)]
*  Hillary's political career was always a grassroots movement, a prairie fire, if you will. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  She had famously brought support from top DNC officials to several billionaire Democratic [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=317.42s)]
*  donors. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=322.2s)]
*  Ron Burkle came out for Hillary. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=323.2s)]
*  That's like winning every voter in the state of Ohio, at least from a fundraising perspective. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=325.64s)]
*  So clearly she's got the mechanics down. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=330.24s)]
*  How about the issues? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=332.32s)]
*  What's Hillary going to run on? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=333.32s)]
*  Come on, think about it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=334.96s)]
*  Libya? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=336.52s)]
*  She's going to run on what she did in the North African nation of Libya. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=337.52s)]
*  It's the one achievement of her life that's uniquely hers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=341.64s)]
*  Her husband had nothing to do with it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=344.52s)]
*  As Secretary of State under Obama, Hillary Clinton ordered the killing of Momor Gaddafi. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=346.38s)]
*  He was the bloodthirsty Libyan strongman who was also, let's be honest, creepy and weird [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=350.96s)]
*  and therefore deserving of death. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=355.56s)]
*  Hillary had him offed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  Then she laughed about it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=359.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=361.12s)]
*  That is the land of unconfirmed... [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=362.32s)]
*  Yes, we came, we saw, he died. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=364.56s)]
*  Did it have anything to do with your visit? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=367.56s)]
*  No, I'm sure it did. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=370.88s)]
*  Oh, we came, we saw, he died. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=373.8s)]
*  Pretty funny. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=378.64s)]
*  But then what happened? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=379.64s)]
*  Once Hillary killed the leader of the country, how did the country do? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=380.76s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=383.88s)]
*  We'll tell the story in pictures. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=385.4s)]
*  Here's the capital of Libya before Hillary Clinton decided to introduce the Libyan people [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=387.8s)]
*  to a little thing we call human rights. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=392.4s)]
*  The city looks fine. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=394.76s)]
*  But underneath, there was no freedom. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=396.24s)]
*  There were too few Soros-backed NGOs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=398.62s)]
*  She changed that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=401.26s)]
*  Now, here's that same city, post-Hillary. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=402.44s)]
*  Those people in the foreground are African slaves. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=405.82s)]
*  They're being sold as property in the now thriving slave markets in downtown Tripoli. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=408.32s)]
*  No, they don't look very happy, that's true. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  But at least Gaddafi's gone. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=416.24s)]
*  So on some level, they're free. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=417.52s)]
*  They've been liberated by Hillary Clinton, despite the fact they're now enslaved. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=419.64s)]
*  That's called progress. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=423.28s)]
*  It's worth something. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  In fact, it's a pretty good campaign slogan. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  Hillary 2024, she'll do for us what she did for Libya. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=427.56s)]
*  You can imagine the posters and t-shirts and coffee mugs. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=432.08s)]
*  Somebody's going to need to get those slaves to sign a consent form. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=434.84s)]
*  Put that on the list. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=437.52s)]
*  But all of a sudden, Hillary Clinton for president, starting to sound a little less crazy, isn't [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=438.76s)]
*  it? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=442.96s)]
*  In fact, it's starting to sound inevitable. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=443.96s)]
*  There really is two questions left to answer. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=446.6s)]
*  Why did Hillary lose last time? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=449.16s)]
*  And who would she run against two years from now? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=451.62s)]
*  Let's take the first question first. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  It's got the simplest, most obvious answer. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=455.8s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was cheated out of her rightful destiny in 2016 because unseen forces of evil [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=458.24s)]
*  worked furiously to undermine her because they feared her strength and goodness. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Come on, you knew that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=469.24s)]
*  Hillary Clinton certainly knows that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=471.48s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  The Russians, let's say WikiLeaks, same thing, dumped the John Podesta emails. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=474.32s)]
*  I have my complaints about former director Comey. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=482.24s)]
*  The use of my email account was turned into, you know, the biggest scandal since Lord knows [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=486.84s)]
*  when. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=493.88s)]
*  They covered it like it was Pearl Harbor. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=494.88s)]
*  If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=496.68s)]
*  There's all these stories about, you know, guys over in Macedonia who are running these [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=504.04s)]
*  fake news sites. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=508.12s)]
*  I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=509.32s)]
*  I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=512.24s)]
*  You know, if the election had been on October 27th, I'd be your president. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=517.76s)]
*  And it wasn't. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=521.08s)]
*  It was on October 28th, and there was just a lot of funny business going on around that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=522.08s)]
*  So the Russians, WikiLeaks, Jim Comey, Facebook, Democratic Party saboteurs, and the citizenry [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=527.8s)]
*  of Macedonia. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=534.7199999999999s)]
*  Those are the people who did the funny business that was like Pearl Harbor that prevented [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=536.4s)]
*  Hillary from becoming president. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=539.68s)]
*  That's who opposed her last time, obviously. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=541.16s)]
*  Who's going to oppose her this time? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  Well for the answer to that question, we turn, as we always do, to Mr. Tom Friedman of The [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=546.04s)]
*  New York Times, who was both a Pulitzer Prize winner and a certified moron. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=550.56s)]
*  In that paradoxical way that's familiar to Washingtonians, Tom Friedman is just dumb [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=554.9s)]
*  enough to get a lot of things right. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  If Tom Friedman thinks it, chances are a lot of other self-important mediocrities think [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=562.18s)]
*  it too. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=565.74s)]
*  And those are the people who run this country. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=566.74s)]
*  Yesterday, Tom Friedman wrote a piece calling on Joe Biden to replace Kamala Harris with [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=568.98s)]
*  Liz Cheney in the next election. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, if you're not Tom Friedman or his friends, this might strike you as ridiculous. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  In fact, it might seem like yet another sign that our political class has reached peak [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=579.38s)]
*  decadence and exhaustion. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=583.74s)]
*  If they're pushing a Cheney in the next presidential cycle, maybe they've run out of ideas. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=586.5s)]
*  Well, of course they have. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=590.94s)]
*  And that's exactly what gives Hillary such a natural opening here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=592.92s)]
*  As long as we're turning our politics into a 1990 sitcom reunion, why not get George [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=596.22s)]
*  W. Bush to run? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=600.54s)]
*  That's not a crazy idea. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=601.78s)]
*  He's got the time to do it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=603.02s)]
*  At this stage, Bush would much rather run with Hillary than against Hillary, their personal [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=604.5s)]
*  friends, on most things they agree vehemently. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  But having a Bush and a Clinton on the same ticket wouldn't work. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=610.94s)]
*  It's just too obvious. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=614.0200000000001s)]
*  Maybe W. could be convinced to take one for the establishment and throw on the Republican [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  jersey one last time. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=619.74s)]
*  He's 75, but that is a full presidential term younger than Joe Biden, which by current standards [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=622.1400000000001s)]
*  qualifies as fresh new leadership. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=627.74s)]
*  George W. 2024, time to give the younger generation a chance. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=629.86s)]
*  It might work. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=634.2600000000001s)]
*  Or not. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=635.2600000000001s)]
*  Just spitballing here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=636.2600000000001s)]
*  By the way, it is way past time to get Hillary back into the White House. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=637.34s)]
*  The lady's got a speech to give. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=641.18s)]
*  She wrote it five years ago for her inevitable inauguration, thanks to the Macedonians that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=643.34s)]
*  didn't happen. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=647.66s)]
*  But she never threw it away. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=649.02s)]
*  She still got the speech. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=650.76s)]
*  Last month she read a portion of it on NBC News. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=652.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=655.46s)]
*  I dream of going up to her and sitting down next to her, taking her in my arms and saying, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=656.46s)]
*  Look at me. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=665.66s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=667.3s)]
*  You will survive. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=669.3s)]
*  You will have a good family of your own and three children. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=671.6s)]
*  And as hard as it might be to imagine, your daughter will grow up and become the president [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=676.66s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=683.86s)]
*  Who's she crying for? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=687.06s)]
*  Herself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=688.38s)]
*  In case you're confused by the context there, that was Hillary telling her deceased mother [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=689.38s)]
*  that everything is going to be okay because Hillary has been elected president of the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=693.56s)]
*  United States. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=696.2399999999999s)]
*  No more tears. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=697.2399999999999s)]
*  No more anxiety. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  We're going to make it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=699.7199999999999s)]
*  We've got a woman in the White House. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=700.7199999999999s)]
*  A lot's happened since Hillary Clinton wrote those words. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=702.88s)]
*  It's a different country now than it was five years ago. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  But Hillary Clinton hasn't changed. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  Her primary interests remain exactly what they always were. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=709.3599999999999s)]
*  She's still talking with endless and undimmed enthusiasm about herself. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=712.4s)]
*  We don't know what's in the rest of her victory speech. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=717.64s)]
*  We're going to have to wait until January of 2025 to find out. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=719.1199999999999s)]
*  The one thing we can safely assume, it ends with a cackle and a finger. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2ZSQmlszY&t=722.92s)]
