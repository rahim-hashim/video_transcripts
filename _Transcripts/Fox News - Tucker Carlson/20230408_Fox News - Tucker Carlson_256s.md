# Former Green Beret sounds off on Biden blaming Trump for Afghanistan withdrawal
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54)
*  So the pullout from Afghanistan under Joe Biden was one of the most humiliating foreign policy disasters in American history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=0.0s)]
*  It's hard to think of one more humiliating. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Thirteen American servicemen killed, thousands of American citizens left behind. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=9.92s)]
*  Many Afghans died, by the way, some of them fell off airplanes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=15.44s)]
*  Others were blown up in drone strikes for no obvious reason by the Biden administration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  And maybe worst of all, we turned the Taliban into the best armed military force after Pakistan in the entire region. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=22.52s)]
*  Joe Biden did that his first summer as president. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  So what does the administration have to say about this? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=34.96s)]
*  Well, in a new report, they take no responsibility whatsoever. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=37.96s)]
*  Instead, they blame it on somehow Donald Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  So today, Fox's Peter Ducey asked John Kirby, how does that make sense? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=44.92s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=50.04s)]
*  You admit that the intel was bad. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=51.64s)]
*  So how can President Biden ever trust when they come into the Oval Office with the PDB that anything in there is legit? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=54.28s)]
*  What I said was that intelligence is a mosaic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=61.24s)]
*  What if the mosaic, all the pieces are incorrect? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=63.88s)]
*  What I said was intelligence is hard business and they get it right a lot, too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=66.64s)]
*  There were some pieces here that weren't accurate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=72.08s)]
*  This document and this effort isn't about accountability today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  This is the next muscle movement in what will be a long process to better understand and comprehend and adjust to what we learned and what we did in Afghanistan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=79.52s)]
*  There were children being killed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=88.32s)]
*  There were people hanging off of Air Force jets that were leaving. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=90.16s)]
*  And you're saying that you guys are proud of the way that this mission was conducted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=93.56s)]
*  Does that mean of that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=98.8s)]
*  Proud of the fact that we got more than 124000 people safely out of Afghanistan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=101.32s)]
*  You bet. Proud of the fact that we now have about 100000 Afghans, our former allies and partners, living in this country and working towards citizenship. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=107.2s)]
*  You bet. Does that mean that everything went perfect in that evacuation? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=116.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=119.96s)]
*  Few things more degrading to the reputation, hard earned reputation of the American Armed Services than having a shameless liar like that man, John Kirby, speaking on its behalf. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=122.32s)]
*  Joe Kent carried a weapon in combat zones for most of his life. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  He's retired Green Beret combat veteran, also a former candidate for Congress. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=137.48s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Joe Kent, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  So what do you as someone who spent a lot of his life in that region, what do you make of this explanation? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, first off, Tucker, all the Democrats and Joe Biden are trying to do right now is avoid accountability, shift it back to President Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  That's because House Republicans have finally started putting some pressure on the Biden administration, demanding for accountability. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=157.56s)]
*  So that's the knee-jerk reaction. But this is a complete and total disgrace. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=164.0s)]
*  Look, I would have a lot more respect for the Biden administration if they went after the military industrial complex and the intelligence community for their lies. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=167.4s)]
*  This all goes back to when President Trump attempted to get us out of Afghanistan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=175.92s)]
*  He fought us to the negotiations table. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=179.48s)]
*  And that's when the intelligence community and the military industrial complex lied to the American people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=181.64s)]
*  They leaked it to the media that Putin had put bounties on the heads of American soldiers, the whole Russian bounty narrative. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=186.48s)]
*  And then Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, moved to block Trump from spending money to get us out of Afghanistan in the summer fall time frame of 2020. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=192.2s)]
*  We should have been out then. We had a plan. But then Biden came in and he couldn't do Trump's plan. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  He wanted to get our troops out on his timeline in September 11th of 2021. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  And the military industrial complex continued to lie, this time to Joe Biden. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=210.76s)]
*  You kept hearing those rosy assessments of how the Afghan military was going to hold the ground and they were going to stand and fight for months on end. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=214.68s)]
*  They lied and Americans died as a result. Someone must be held accountable. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=221.4s)]
*  Yeah. So you know what happened. You personally, Joe Kent, know what happened and almost uniquely are brave enough to tell the truth about it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=226.88s)]
*  And this is why they prevented you from winning that seat in Congress and one of the most rotten elections I've ever seen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=233.92s)]
*  And so I hope you'll be running again and continue to tell the truth. Joe Kent, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=239.8s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. I will. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNZ6ivG3_54&t=244.56s)]
