# It feels like ‘no one’ is safe right now: Cryto expert
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8)
*  Nellie Brunel is the host of the CoinStories podcast. She joins us tonight to answer those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=0.0s)]
*  questions. Nellie, thanks so much for coming on. So people are watching this. Some people feel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=4.32s)]
*  vindicated. Others feel really worried. What do you make of it? Hi, Tucker. Well, thank you so [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=8.16s)]
*  much for having me. Look, we're seeing a selloff across the board. It feels like no one is safe [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  right now. And I know that can be really scary for people, but at the same time, we shouldn't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=17.12s)]
*  really be surprised because there's been so much excess added to the system. You mentioned it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  earlier in the newscast. I mean, the federal government has been printing trillions of dollars [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=24.96s)]
*  in the last few years. They were printing before, but it was accelerated as the result of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=29.28s)]
*  pandemic. And that money had to flow somewhere. It went into stocks. It went into crypto and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=33.28s)]
*  Bitcoin, and it caused inflation. Now the government is trying to take inflation seriously. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=37.92s)]
*  They have to try to reduce the balance sheet. They have to try to raise interest rates to make [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  it more expensive to borrow in record debt levels. And so people are selling assets. They're selling [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=46.96s)]
*  stocks, some of those stocks going down further than Bitcoin. People are selling Bitcoin and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  crypto. And I want to make an important distinction here because Bitcoin is not [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=56.88s)]
*  crypto. Bitcoin is digital property, whereas Bitcoin is largely an unregulated securities [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  market. And it's similar in some ways to the dot com bubble of the 90s, where you saw things [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=66.72s)]
*  shoot up in value and then crash down, never to be heard from again. And I urge people caution, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=70.88s)]
*  because we saw some of those stories in the last week. Whereas Bitcoin is a very young, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=75.68s)]
*  but quickly growing technology network that has the power to disrupt and revolutionize our [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=79.92s)]
*  financial system. And it was really designed to decouple money from power, which has caused [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=84.96s)]
*  so many of the problems that exist in society. It is growing very, very quickly. And I think we [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=89.52s)]
*  might see some more short term pain, but in the long run, I think it's going to be a winner. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  So it does. And I think that's a really nice explanation, the way you describe Bitcoin. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  But the idea was that it would be decoupled from fluctuations in the equities market, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  but it seems correlated with the equities market. Do you expect that to change over time? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  I do expect that to change. And look, right now Bitcoin has largely existed in a QE environment [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=111.2s)]
*  where the government is printing money. It has been the beneficiary of that. So it does come down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  But you know what? In previous drawn downs, it's come down even further, the 80, 90 percent range. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=122.64s)]
*  We are not there yet. Could we see it? Absolutely. Again, this is a very young, very volatile, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=127.68s)]
*  early technology network that's growing very quickly. A lot of people don't understand it yet, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=132.8s)]
*  but again, very different from the larger crypto market. Bitcoin is a digital property [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=137.04s)]
*  that has the potential to be in the hands of eight billion people across the world and give them [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=142.0s)]
*  access to a more inclusive financial system. And I think it's important to remember that because, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  as you mentioned in the show, with all this money printing, we've created a system of debt [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=150.64s)]
*  that has crushed savers and it's benefited the people at the top. It's socialized losses [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=154.64s)]
*  and privatized gains. And now we have a country that's polarized and frustrated because people [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=159.04s)]
*  feel left behind. Yes. I'm so nicely put. I'm glad you came on tonight. Thank you very much. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=163.52s)]
*  Good to see you. Thank you for having me. Thank you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf1r271Okh8&t=170.08s)]
