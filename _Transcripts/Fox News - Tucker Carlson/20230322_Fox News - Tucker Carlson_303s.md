# Tucker: This new footage of Dr. Fauci is amazing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY)
*  So the meaning of this country do not exist to inform you, obviously, but to mislead you on behalf of the people in power. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=0.0s)]
*  So it's not surprising the footage you're about to see has been hidden in years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=5.84s)]
*  It just surfaced in a PBS special of all places. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=9.44s)]
*  It shows the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser and Tony Fauci in 2021 visiting residents in a black neighborhood in D.C. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=12.84s)]
*  to push the COVID vaccine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=23.16s)]
*  And you can assess for yourself how well that went. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=25.48s)]
*  So this is ward eight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=29.04s)]
*  It's the typical social determinants of health where they don't get good medical care. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  They have a high degree of HIV, high degree of COVID-19, the lowest level of vaccination. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=36.88s)]
*  So I'm not going to be lining up, taking a shot on a vaccination for something that wasn't clear in the first place. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=42.88s)]
*  And then you all create a shot and miraculous time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=50.32s)]
*  It takes years to create vaccination. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, it used to take years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=58.52s)]
*  If it allows thousands of people like you don't get vaccinated, you're going to let this virus continue to percolate in this country and in this world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  Something like the common flu then, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=67.68s)]
*  You're going to pass. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=69.48s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=70.44s)]
*  Because when you start talking about paying people to get vaccinated, when you start talking about incentivizing things to get people vaccinated, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=71.44s)]
*  there's something else going on with that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  I won't keep doing anymore. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=81.12s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=82.12s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=82.64s)]
*  My campaign is about fear. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  It's about inciting fear in people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=86.36s)]
*  You all attack people with fear. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=88.12s)]
*  That's what this pandemic is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=90.0s)]
*  So great. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=92.44s)]
*  The people of Ward 8 may be poor, but they're not stupid. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=93.28s)]
*  Notice Tony Fauci gazes at them like he's walking through the zoo with contempt and a little bit of fear. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=96.28s)]
*  So he kept getting questions like this from the poor but not stupid people of Ward 8 in D.C. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  One lady asked Tony Fauci if the vaccine would prevent her from getting COVID, which is the most basic of all questions. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  Here's how Fauci responded. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=113.44s)]
*  I heard that it doesn't cure it and it doesn't stop you from getting it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=115.24s)]
*  No. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=121.72s)]
*  On the very, very, very rare chance that you do get it, even if you're vaccinated, it's a very... [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=122.52s)]
*  You don't even feel sick. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  It's like you don't even know you got infected. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=130.12s)]
*  It's very, very good at protecting you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=132.2s)]
*  So it turns out the lady in the tank top was a lot closer to the target than Mr. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=135.44s)]
*  Tony Fauci, the highest paid federal bureaucrat in the world. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=139.76s)]
*  Raymond Arroyo is the author of The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison, and we're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=145.16s)]
*  Raymond, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=150.84s)]
*  You work in D.C. You're familiar with the city. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of this amazing and highly amusing tape? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=155.8s)]
*  Well, you know, first of all, this is on American Masters, Tucker. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, when I watch American Masters, I want to see Sammy Davis Jr., Martha Graham, but now we have Tony Fauci, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=163.6s)]
*  the master of deception, maybe, but not an American master. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=170.88s)]
*  He also... This crew followed him, Tucker, for 23 months, like he's Beyonce. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=175.16s)]
*  You know, every move has to be captured by the camera. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=181.84s)]
*  It is a remarkable document, though, of the common sense of people, even in very poor communities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=184.44s)]
*  They were saying what we were hearing from epidemiologists and virologists all over the country very early on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=191.64s)]
*  Mainly, these are leaky vaccines. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=198.04s)]
*  They don't prevent infection or spread. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=200.48s)]
*  And that man on the on the stoop, you've got to give him props. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=203.4s)]
*  There's a moment where he says, you are incentivizing this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=207.24s)]
*  You're paying us to take this. And that made him squeamish about it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=210.4s)]
*  There's a moment in the documentary, Tucker, where behind Fauci, they have a car and on the car, it says, win me. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=214.12s)]
*  So all it costs to win this car is to allow them to give you the jab, offer your arm. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=220.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. Mr. Rogers' neighborhood is a lot more friendly than Dr. Fauci's. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=226.6s)]
*  You don't want him coming knocking on your door. That's frightening. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  What's so interesting is I spent my life in that city diagonally across it in the rich part of the city, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=234.64s)]
*  where nobody had any questions about the government's motives here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  It's interesting in the poorest, most crime-ridden part of the city, everybody had a kind of gut skepticism that turned out to be well-wanted. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=244.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, and look, when not the cookie monster, but the booster monster comes looking for you, you better hide, hide the kids. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=254.04s)]
*  But I love that people were willing to confront him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=261.0s)]
*  But the arrogance, the arrogance toward these people was striking from Fauci. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=263.72s)]
*  He already had a Disney Plus documentary. Now we've got to get PBS in on the action. Come on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=270.4s)]
*  I love it. All my Harvard-educated neighbors are like, oh, CNN says it's OK, OK. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=275.68s)]
*  This guy doesn't have a job. He's like, what? No, we're not doing that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=280.32s)]
*  I don't think so. God bless them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=284.08s)]
*  Common sense, Tucker. It will save us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=287.2s)]
*  Raymond Arroyo, thanks so much. Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jop8ooKfoLY&t=290.28s)]
