# Talent agent exposes New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc)
*  Well, Taylor Lorenz works at the New York Times, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=0.0s)]
*  defending the interests of the ruling class by force. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=2.7s)]
*  She defames people. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=4.74s)]
*  One person is fighting back, however. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=6.86s)]
*  Her name is Aradna Jacob. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=9.3s)]
*  She's recently filed a $6 million defamation suit [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=11.14s)]
*  against Taylor Lorenz. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=14.18s)]
*  Aradna Jacob is an entrepreneur [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=16.04s)]
*  and influencer marketing expert, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=17.86s)]
*  founder of Influences.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  She joins us to explain her lawsuit. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us tonight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=24.78s)]
*  So Taylor Lorenz stalks the landscape hurting people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  And if you say something about it, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=29.419999999999998s)]
*  she claims you're attacking her [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=30.7s)]
*  because she's got all kinds of neuroses or whatever. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=32.1s)]
*  You're the aggressor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=34.18s)]
*  You're the only person I've seen fight back. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=35.46s)]
*  Tell us why you're doing this [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=37.22s)]
*  and what your claim against her is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=39.3s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=43.4s)]
*  Well, to give you some background, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=44.94s)]
*  I dedicated my career to the influencer marketing industry [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=46.459999999999994s)]
*  for almost 20 years before influencer was even a term. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=50.82s)]
*  And my company, Influences.com, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=54.26s)]
*  was disrupting the entertainment space [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=56.62s)]
*  as we discovered and developed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=58.96s)]
*  some of the biggest internet stars in the world, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  including Charli D'Amelio and Addison Rae. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=63.1s)]
*  And it was devastating when Taylor Lorenz came along [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  with the megaphone of the New York Times [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=69.3s)]
*  and decided to write a scathing article [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=71.42s)]
*  full of lies about us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=74.06s)]
*  And she had to know it was lies [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=75.42s)]
*  because we answered all her questions factually [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=77.18s)]
*  before she published the story. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=80.34s)]
*  I lost my business, my personal reputation, and my income. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=82.32s)]
*  In Spanish, we say, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=86.66s)]
*  there are laws, but there is no justice. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=87.82s)]
*  And in this case, Tucker, I really pray for justice [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  because Taylor Lorenz has a pattern of lying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=93.72s)]
*  and destroying innocent people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  and manipulating young people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=98.08s)]
*  And she needs to be held accountable. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=100.32s)]
*  I came to this country legally from Mexico [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=102.33999999999999s)]
*  when I was a little girl and my father died. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  And it was my dream to build a company. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=106.72s)]
*  And for a privileged bully like Taylor Lorenz [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=108.6s)]
*  to take it away from somebody like me is just wrong. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=111.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but very common. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  You know her MO though, even using her name in public [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=118.56s)]
*  will elicit some self-pitying stream on Twitter [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  about how you're committing violence against her [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=124.24s)]
*  and endangering her. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=125.96s)]
*  She can totally crush your life or the lives of kids, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=127.32s)]
*  which she has done, but you're not allowed to fight back. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=129.64s)]
*  Are you ready for the further attacks on you? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=133.0s)]
*  Well, I am ready, but I honestly am here [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=137.92s)]
*  because I'm telling the truth [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=142.32s)]
*  and I don't care what attacks come from her. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=143.64s)]
*  In fact, Taylor Lorenz had a conflict of interest [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=147.32s)]
*  when she came after me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=150.22s)]
*  She had a financial partnership [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=151.98s)]
*  with Hollywood Giants United Talent Agency [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=153.66s)]
*  and UTA were also my direct business rivals. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Taylor wrote a glowing article about UTA [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=161.7s)]
*  in the New York Times without disclosing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=164.22s)]
*  that they represented her. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=166.04s)]
*  And soon after it was announced [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=167.42s)]
*  that UTA got Taylor Lorenz a book deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=168.98s)]
*  It's no surprise that when Taylor's article left me [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=171.38s)]
*  blacklisted and penniless [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=174.3s)]
*  that many of my clients ended up at UTA. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=176.12s)]
*  And there's no recourse for someone like me, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  a non-celebrity to get the truth out there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=181.44s)]
*  In fact, many primetime news anchors [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  are represented also by UTA. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=186.0s)]
*  But that's not all. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=190.0s)]
*  Eight months after her defamatory article, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=191.08s)]
*  she continued to attack me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  When she heard that I was raising capital for a new venture, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=196.12s)]
*  she went behind the scenes [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=200.0s)]
*  calling prominent people in the media, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  ranting that I'm a literal abuser [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=203.4s)]
*  who doesn't deserve positive press, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=205.16s)]
*  I guess to cripple my career and silence me forever. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=206.78s)]
*  And this is an abuse of power. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=210.6s)]
*  The New York Times, even after I filed a lawsuit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=212.72s)]
*  against them, which isn't easy by the way, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=215.28s)]
*  they continue to stand behind Taylor's disgusting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  and sinister behavior. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=220.64s)]
*  How does Taylor Lorenz still have a job? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=222.24s)]
*  Because she's intimidated people into silence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  She's the bully, but she's calling you an abuser. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=227.28s)]
*  I hope you end this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=230.2s)]
*  I really do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=231.4s)]
*  Ariadne and Jacob, thank you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=232.62s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=234.42s)]
*  All of us who've watched this with jaws open. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=235.26s)]
*  How is this woman terrorizing the country [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=237.38s)]
*  and nobody has the stones to fight back? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=239.42s)]
*  So thanks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqrOCKopZc&t=241.66s)]
