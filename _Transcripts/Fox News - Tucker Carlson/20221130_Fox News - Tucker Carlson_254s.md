# DeSantis warns Apple about potentially pulling Twitter from App store
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g)
*  Apple is considering, according to Elon Musk, removing Twitter from its app store, which would, of course, shut down Twitter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=0.0s)]
*  And almost nobody in office has noticed this or decided to comment on it except for Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=6.54s)]
*  He's the governor of the state of Florida. He joins us to thank Governor. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=12.76s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. So of all the news going on in the world, and there's a lot of it, you stopped on this story and you commented on it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=15.24s)]
*  Why? Why did this catch your attention? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=24.5s)]
*  Well, Tucker, if you look what's going on in China now, the CCP, they have been posing the zero covid lockdown policies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=28.68s)]
*  They've been doing it on and off for three years. And you have people in China that are really engaged in a noble effort to protest, which is basically Leninist rule. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=36.0s)]
*  So what is Apple doing with that? They are limiting the airdrop function of the protesters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=45.44s)]
*  So they are serving basically as a vassal to the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=50.92s)]
*  Then, on the other hand, here in the United States, what are they doing? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=56.18s)]
*  They are trying to get Elon Musk's Twitter off the app store, potentially, which would be a huge blow for free speech. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=60.22s)]
*  And so this is maybe the most powerful company in the entire world, certainly one of the most powerful companies in American history. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=67.3s)]
*  They exercise more authority in some respects than even some governments do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  And they're using their authority to protect the CCP while also try to limit speech here in the United States. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=80.42s)]
*  While existing as an American, supposedly American company, using our copyright protections, our rule of law to their own advantage, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=88.62s)]
*  they're benefiting from America, but working against our most basic value, which is free speech. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=95.62s)]
*  What can be done about that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=100.22s)]
*  Well, Tucker, in the States, you know, we did big tech censorship bill two years ago. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=104.06s)]
*  It's gotten caught up in the courts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=108.34s)]
*  I think the U.S. Supreme Court is going to accept that case for this term. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  Texas has a similar case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=113.02s)]
*  There's a conflict in the circuits. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  And so whatever the states can do to protect people's rights, to engage in free expression and, you know, what some of these companies do, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=116.58s)]
*  they get a lot of benefits from the government, as you said, patent, things like that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=124.1s)]
*  The social media companies get liability protection, and yet they turn around and they use that protection to marginalize voices they disagree with. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=128.14s)]
*  So I think from the congressional perspective, though, they need to look at antitrust with these massive companies because they are exercising [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=136.82s)]
*  massive amounts of power over our society. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=145.62s)]
*  So one of the companies was benefiting a lot from the government, the government of the state of Florida, actually, was Disney. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=149.42s)]
*  You changed that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=154.66s)]
*  So they just switched CEOs because of that, because of what you did. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  The new CEO was the old CEO, Bob Iger, who sells a town hall for employees. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=159.98s)]
*  And he said he regretted that Disney had fought with your administration over a bill that you backed that banned teachers from talking to kindergartners about sex. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=163.34s)]
*  So then Disney's response led Florida state legislatures to strip, as you know, of course, because you backed it, Disney of its special status. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=173.02s)]
*  Here's what Iger said today. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=179.38s)]
*  I was sorry to see us dragged into that battle. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  And I have no idea exactly what its ramifications are in terms of the business itself. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=188.34s)]
*  What I can say is the state of Florida has been important to us for a long time and we have been very important to the state of Florida. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=196.06s)]
*  That is something I'm extremely mindful of and will articulate if I get the chance. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=204.22s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=209.18s)]
*  You talk about you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=210.38s)]
*  We didn't drag them in, Tucker. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=213.1s)]
*  They went in on their own and not only opposed the bill, they threatened to get it repealed. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=214.78s)]
*  These are parents rights, important policies in our state that are very popular. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=219.7s)]
*  And so they brought this on themselves. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=223.82s)]
*  All we did was stand up for what's right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=226.3s)]
*  And yes, they're a big, powerful company. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=228.5s)]
*  But you know what? We stand up for our folks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=230.38s)]
*  And I don't care what a Burbank based California company says about our laws. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=232.58s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis of the state of Florida, thanks so much for that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=238.62s)]
*  We'll be right back. Thanks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=241.94s)]
*  Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=244.78s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OChYqv3gV9g&t=251.86s)]
