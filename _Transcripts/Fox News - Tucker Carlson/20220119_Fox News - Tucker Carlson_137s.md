# Tucker reacts to Biden’s 'divisive' remarks at presser
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE)
*  Joe Biden doesn't appear in public very often. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=0.0s)]
*  Too scary, doesn't want to get the rona. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=4.92s)]
*  But when he does, and once he starts talking, whoop, it's hard to slow that man down. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=6.46s)]
*  Can't stop him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=10.58s)]
*  His press conference went on for two hours. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=11.58s)]
*  And of course it wasn't all about COVID. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=13.96s)]
*  It wasn't about anything that actually mattered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=16.0s)]
*  No questions on crime or immigration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=18.14s)]
*  Murder rates up dramatically. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  The southern borders open millions of foreign nationals whose names we don't know are streaming [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=22.84s)]
*  in. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=26.44s)]
*  But don't ask. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=27.44s)]
*  Nobody did. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=28.76s)]
*  But Biden did have the chance and certainly had the time to make a lot of strange claims [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  about his first year in office. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=34.24s)]
*  So it was just very, very strange. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=36.88s)]
*  Here's a selection. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=39.56s)]
*  In fact, my plan cuts the deficit and boosts the economy by getting more people into the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=40.56s)]
*  workforce. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=47.64s)]
*  And so I don't think I've overpromised at all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=48.64s)]
*  And I'm going to stay on this track. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Very few schools are closing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Over 95 percent are still open. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=56.4s)]
*  No matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you're going to see them [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=63.56s)]
*  Let me get something straight here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=69.64s)]
*  How long are you guys ready to go? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=71.6s)]
*  You want to go for another hour or two? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=73.38s)]
*  Putin has a, you know, has a stark choice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=75.08s)]
*  He either de-escalation or diplomacy, a confrontation of the consequences. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=78.56s)]
*  I'm not so sure he has a certain what he's going to do. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=83.48s)]
*  My guess is he will move in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=87.84s)]
*  He has to do something. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=90.16s)]
*  I think report cards can look pretty good if that's where we're at. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=91.36s)]
*  Made a kind of a quick back of the envelope list here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=97.0s)]
*  My plan cuts the deficit by spending trillions more. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=100.12s)]
*  That'll work. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  Very few schools are closed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=105.28s)]
*  Just happens to be your kids' schools and your sister's kids' schools and the schools [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  of everyone you know. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=110.56s)]
*  But most schools are not closed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  Very few, in fact. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=113.64s)]
*  No matter how hard they try to make it for minorities to vote. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  And that's the one that sticks out being completely false, but also utterly divisive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  Some percentage of people are going to believe that and to think that your government is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=124.64s)]
*  making it harder for you to exercise your franchise because of your skin color. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  If you wanted to increase hatred and division, that's exactly what you'd say. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=132.22s)]
*  And that's what he said. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_emBolkRaE&t=135.68s)]
