# Kari Lake: 'The press has gone bad and the people are awake to it'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM)
*  Liz Cheney is so loathsome on every level that even with her last name, voters in Wyoming rejected her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Republican primary recently, so she's out, but she's got a couple more months in Congress, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=6.16s)]
*  and she's spending her time not helping the state she supposedly represents, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=10.4s)]
*  but attacking Carrie Lake in Arizona. So Cheney is so obsessed with Carrie Lake [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=13.92s)]
*  that she cut an ad against her. Watch this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=21.36s)]
*  I don't know that I have ever voted for a Democrat, but if I lived in Arizona, I absolutely would. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=25.28s)]
*  You have a candidate for governor, Carrie Lake. You have a candidate for secretary of state, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=31.6s)]
*  Mark Fincham, both of whom have said that they will only honor the results of an election if [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=36.16s)]
*  they agree with it. And if you care about the survival of our republic, we cannot give people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=41.36s)]
*  power who will not honor elections. I've never voted for a Democrat. Well, of course, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=47.6s)]
*  Liz Cheney is a left-wing Democrat. Let's stop lying. So in response to that ad, Carrie Lake [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=52.96s)]
*  wrote this letter to Liz Cheney. It begins, quote, Dear Liz, thank you for your generous, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=58.32s)]
*  in-kind contribution to my campaign. Your recent TV ad urging Arizonans not to vote for me is doing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  just the opposite. Our campaign donations are skyrocketing and our website nearly crashed from the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=66.64s)]
*  traffic. Carrie Lake is running for governor of Arizona. As noted, she joins us tonight. Carrie [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=71.28s)]
*  Lake, thanks so much for coming on. Is that true? That's true. Liz Cheney now is officially my [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=75.92s)]
*  biggest fundraiser to date. We've raised a half a million dollars since she did the anti-endorsement [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=82.0s)]
*  and people are still flocking to our website, carrylake.com and donating. It's been an incredible [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=88.88s)]
*  boom for us in fundraising. So I got to extend a big thank you to Liz. And at this rate, Tucker, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=95.12s)]
*  we might have to invite her to our inaugural ball because we're going to have to thank her [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=101.92s)]
*  for bringing in so much fundraising money for us. Well, but you'd think it's a little weird [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=106.0s)]
*  since she is a congresswoman still from Wyoming. She's got a lot of hobbies. She could be planning [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=111.36s)]
*  a new invasion of Somalia or something, but she's attacking you. She's very focused on you. Why? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=116.64s)]
*  Why is that, do you think? Well, I think the same reason I'm being attacked by the media. I'm [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=122.16s)]
*  speaking the truth. I mean, you talked about it in your monologue tonight. We can't talk about all [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=127.36s)]
*  these issues because the media has told us they're prohibited. You know, you can't talk about vaccines. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=132.24s)]
*  You can't talk about elections. You can't talk about Paul Pelosi. Now you can't talk about Nancy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=137.36s)]
*  Pelosi and you can't talk about the elections and you can't talk about COVID. And I'm talking about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  all those things because I still believe we have a little bit of the First Amendment left, but I'm [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  dangerous to people like Liz Cheney and the folks that she hangs out with and they want to stop [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=153.68s)]
*  people like me. Words are powerful. I will say the left, Liz Cheney, for example, they understand [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  that. So I want to ask your reaction to this story. So recently the headquarters for Katie Hobbs, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=164.64s)]
*  that's the person you're running against in the governor's race, will not debate you, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=169.92s)]
*  was vandalized. The suspect broke in and stole a few things. The suspect's name is Daniel [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  Moda Dos Reyes and reportedly he's an illegal immigrant to this country. What's your reaction [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=177.2s)]
*  to that story? He's currently in this country illegally and I had heard that as well, but you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=182.72s)]
*  know, you can't say that now because you can't talk about that. It's insensitive. And the press [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  won't report that. And I'm glad that you just said that because that's right. He is currently [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=194.48s)]
*  in this country illegally, just like it sounds like we've had many other instances where people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=199.84s)]
*  are here illegally and the reporters never even ask that because it proves the point that having [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=204.64s)]
*  a wide open border means more crime, higher incidents of crime for American citizens. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing here in Arizona. And you talked about the homeless man that was found, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  half naked in Pelosi's home. This is why Republicans have ideas to stop these problems. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=220.4s)]
*  I have a homeless policy. The press doesn't want to talk about that. I have a policy to work to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  end chronic street homelessness, get people help, get them off the streets and return quality of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=231.68s)]
*  life for the hardworking people of Arizona. But the press would rather act like there's been some [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=236.56s)]
*  Watergate break-in at my opponent's office. I don't even know where her office is, by the way. I [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  assumed it was in a basement somewhere. They'd rather cover that and make up lies than cover [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=247.12s)]
*  our policies, which will actually help the people of Arizona and make them safer. The press has gone [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  bad and the people are awake to it. The fact that even run someone as lame as Katie Hobbs, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=258.96s)]
*  for governor of a major state, tells you that they believe they have the system wired. They [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=265.12s)]
*  think they can't lose. I mean, why wouldn't they pick someone who can talk? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=268.88s)]
*  Well, her sister, her twin sister, actually, there was some undercover video of her the other day [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=272.72s)]
*  saying that she voted for me. And I was listening to her in that undercover video and she could [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  actually communicate a little better. And I thought, well, she's obviously smarter if she voted for me [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=282.32s)]
*  and she can obviously articulate some points. Why didn't they run her twin sister instead of Katie, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=286.88s)]
*  who can't seem to articulate even her policies before the people of Arizona in a debate? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  No. Damn, it's almost sad. Carrie Lake, joining us tonight. Thank you very much. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnOVk1257hM&t=299.04s)]
