# Mom of fentanyl victims warns Tucker about worsening drug crisis: 'This is a war'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU)
*  Rebecca Kiesling lost both of her sons, if you can imagine that, to fentanyl. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=0.0s)]
*  Her 18-year-old son, Kyler, and her 20-year-old son, Caleb, both were poisoned in 2020 when [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=4.0s)]
*  they took what they thought were Percocet pills, but they weren't. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=10.76s)]
*  They were fentanyl. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=13.92s)]
*  Yesterday, Rebecca Kiesling testified in the House of Representatives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=15.16s)]
*  She pointed out that our government isn't doing anything to protect America's young [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=17.72s)]
*  people from this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=21.76s)]
*  If we had Chinese troops lining up along our southern border with weapons aimed at our [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=23.92s)]
*  people, with weapons of mass destruction aimed at our cities, you damn well know you would [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=32.52s)]
*  do something about it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=38.040000000000006s)]
*  We have a weather balloon from China going across our country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=40.52s)]
*  Nobody died, and everybody's freaking out about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=45.88s)]
*  About 100,000 die every year, and nothing's being done. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=49.72s)]
*  Not enough is being done. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=54.32s)]
*  Numbers are going up, not down. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=55.76s)]
*  You're welcoming drug dealers across our border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=58.48s)]
*  You're giving them protection. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  You're not protecting our children. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=63.48s)]
*  Rebecca Kiesling joins us tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=67.84s)]
*  Ms. Kiesling, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=69.48s)]
*  You certainly made the point to the Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=73.0s)]
*  Do you think they heard you? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=75.36s)]
*  More than half of them did, but I was really appalled at some of the rhetoric that I heard, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  honestly, from the Democrats saying that they've heard a lot of fear mongering. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=86.64s)]
*  Like, are you kidding me? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=92.44s)]
*  Like 110,000 died in 2021. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=94.84s)]
*  Like, we have a reason to be afraid. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=101.0s)]
*  China is going after our children. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  We've got rainbow fentanyl now in candy boxes coming into this country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=105.84s)]
*  And now they're mixing fentanyl with a horse tranquilizer so that Narcan won't work, so [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=111.84s)]
*  it can't be detected by fentanyl strips. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=118.4s)]
*  Like, they're trying to kill off our population, and you're going to accuse me and the others [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=120.92s)]
*  testifying that we're fear mongering? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  So you lost both your sons to poisoning by a foreign government, and you're a fear monger? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=129.55999999999997s)]
*  They... [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, what was your reaction? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  I can't even... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  It's hard even to believe that happened. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  What was your reaction to that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  So disgusting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, I was really upset by the guy from the Cato Institute who testified that the problem [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  is demand. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=150.2s)]
*  And that's like some of the rhetoric that I've heard on social media since I testified. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  People saying, oh, they wanted it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, like, they were doing something illegal, so they deserve to die? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=158.08s)]
*  People didn't used to die from experimenting with drugs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=163.84s)]
*  And of course I taught my children not to do drugs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=166.84s)]
*  They heard it more than anybody else because their birth mother was a drug addict. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=169.96s)]
*  But they still experimented anyway. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=175.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, over 100,000 are, and they're dying. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=177.48s)]
*  They still deserve to be protected. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=182.6s)]
*  It's a health issue. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=185.6s)]
*  They deserved real help, but they deserve to be protected from an attack by, as you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=186.76s)]
*  said, a foreign nation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=191.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, they didn't take fentanyl. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  They took what they thought was Percocet. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=195.72s)]
*  And like so many young people, they were poisoned to death by something that was mislabeled. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=197.56s)]
*  I mean, no different from the Tylenol murders that took place 40 years ago where people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=203.16s)]
*  put cyanide in Tylenol. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=207.44s)]
*  They thought they were taking Tylenol, they got cyanide. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=208.44s)]
*  I mean, but the libertarian response was, it's their fault. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=211.04s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=214.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=215.72s)]
*  That's what I'm seeing on social media. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=217.68s)]
*  There's some people that are extremely callous. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=218.68s)]
*  I mean, how cold-hearted can you be to speak to me like that, to say such horrible things [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=220.84s)]
*  that they deserve to die and that I was a horrible mother and somebody should have called [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=228.68s)]
*  CPS? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=234.2s)]
*  I mean, they know nothing about what happened and how much I tried and how I sought help [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=235.2s)]
*  for them through the school, through the police. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=241.72s)]
*  I mean, they have no idea what I went through to fight for them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=244.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=247.72s)]
*  Well, we've interviewed a lot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=248.72s)]
*  I know personally a number of parents in your position and to blame you for it or your children [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=250.56s)]
*  who died from poisoning is really, we'd really have to be the Cato Institute to do that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  So I'm sorry you had to hear it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=261.08s)]
*  Rebecca Kiesling, thank you very much. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHNUeILD3OU&t=262.56s)]
