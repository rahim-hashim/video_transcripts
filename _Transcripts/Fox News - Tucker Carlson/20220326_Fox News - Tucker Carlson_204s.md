# They have everything upside down: Phillips
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI)
*  So in Los Angeles, George Soros funded a new district attorney called George Gascon and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=0.0s)]
*  he stopped enforcing laws against theft. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=5.0s)]
*  What do you think happened then? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, theft went up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=8.08s)]
*  People stealing everywhere. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=10.0s)]
*  Thieves walking into jewelry stores and just robbing them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=11.52s)]
*  A few days ago thieves stole three million dollars worth of jewelry from a single shop [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=13.6s)]
*  in Beverly Hills. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=17.0s)]
*  But instead of stopping these criminals, officials in LA are telling residents, we'll just don't [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=18.28s)]
*  wear jewelry. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=22.16s)]
*  Here's the police chief of LA. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=23.16s)]
*  There's been a marked increase of armed robberies involving victims wearing expensive jewelry. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=26.16s)]
*  And what we're asking the public to be mindful of is that with these increases, that if they're [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  going to wear expensive jewelry or as they are involved in perhaps driving high-end cars, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=36.04s)]
*  leaving restaurants, taverns and other locations, that they be mindful of their surroundings, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  that they remain in well-lit areas, and that they recognize that there are opportunists [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  that are attempting to take advantage of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=53.48s)]
*  And many times these individuals are armed with a firearm. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=56.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's Brazil. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=61.08s)]
*  John Phillips, the host of the John Phillips Show, he joins us tonight. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=62.72s)]
*  John, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=65.0s)]
*  How is what we just heard different from a cop saying, like, there's a rapist out, don't [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  look hot. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=71.24s)]
*  You know, no spandex for you because you might get raped. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=72.24s)]
*  You might incite him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's blaming people for wearing jewelry in public. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is their attitude. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=79.92s)]
*  We have a Soros district attorney. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=82.2s)]
*  We have a mayor who called the cops killers and then cut their budget. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=84.22s)]
*  We have a board of supervisors who went to war with our sheriff, Alex Villanueva, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  wants to get rid of men's central jail and the juvenile hall. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  So even if we arrest people, we have no place to put them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=95.48s)]
*  Surprise, surprise, L.A. County looks like the departure's gate over at Spirit Airlines. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=98.56s)]
*  And it's not just in the traditional high crime areas where all this is going on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=103.16s)]
*  It's happening in Santa Monica. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=107.64s)]
*  It's happening on Melrose. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=109.28s)]
*  It's happening on La Cienega. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=110.4s)]
*  It's happening on Beverly Hills. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  And specifically, they're saying they're going after big ticket items, Rolex watches, luxury [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=114.24s)]
*  cars. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=120.52s)]
*  And just today on the radio show, I had a listener call in who said that he was robbed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=121.52s)]
*  at gunpoint in the parking lot of Costco in Marina Del Rey, a very nice part of Los Angeles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=125.88s)]
*  And the thieves didn't take anything that said Kirkland on it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  They took his very expensive watch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=135.28s)]
*  And this is what we live with. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=137.68s)]
*  And the cops say, well, don't wear the watch. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=138.96s)]
*  Well, don't drive the fancy car. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=140.96s)]
*  Well, people don't move to California to look frumpy and be late. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=142.68s)]
*  They move here to be fashionable and be late. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=146.24s)]
*  But great line. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=149.12s)]
*  Also, but whose country is it? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=150.68s)]
*  You know, the people who pay the taxes or does it belong to homeless drug addicts and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=152.32s)]
*  robbers? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=156.0s)]
*  I mean, why are we accommodating them? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=157.0s)]
*  Shouldn't the authorities we pay for get them off the street? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=158.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  They look at the criminal as the victim. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=163.9s)]
*  And if you are the victim of a crime, they want you to check your privilege. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  They have everything upside down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=169.88s)]
*  What is right is wrong. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=172.4s)]
*  What is wrong is right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  But that is what the political establishment here thinks from top to bottom, from the mayor, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=174.96s)]
*  the district attorney, the police chief down to the city council. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=179.48s)]
*  The whole county needs a change. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=182.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's a punishment regime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=184.88s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=186.68s)]
*  That's what equity is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=187.68s)]
*  They're hurting you on purpose. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=188.68s)]
*  John Phillips, appreciate it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=189.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=191.32s)]
*  Very nicely put. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=192.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-_47gSMlcI&t=193.32s)]
