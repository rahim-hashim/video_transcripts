# Candace Owens: Democrats should be forced to live with the Kamala they created
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4)
*  Tonight we are endorsing Kamala D. Harris for the 2024 Democratic primaries. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=0.0s)]
*  She deserves it. And so do Democrats. They created her. They should be forced to live with her. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=4.72s)]
*  And anyone who disagrees with that is by definition a racist. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=10.32s)]
*  Candace Owens is the founder of the charity BlackSit. She joins us tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=14.32s)]
*  It's a little weird, Candace Owens, to see the Democratic party, people like David Axelrod [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=17.6s)]
*  and Joe Scarborough and the whole brain trust, whip around and attack with great venom the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=22.16s)]
*  highest ranking woman of color in the United States. You know, Tucker, I don't have to answer [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=28.4s)]
*  your questions. I'm black. I'm a woman. I like hip hop. I don't have to answer anything that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  you're saying coherently. But yeah, this is I feel like I have to actually defend these people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=38.64s)]
*  I have to defend the left on this one. Kamala Harris, she did kind of slip through the cracks, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  even for me. I was so focused on the presidential election on Joe Biden's mental faculties that I [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=49.28s)]
*  didn't realize that, you know, she was just, you know, completely daft. It actually startled me [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=54.4s)]
*  after the election to keep hearing her speak, to have nothing make any sense. So I think that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=59.12s)]
*  they're all standing around going, whoa, we had no idea. We were all worried about Biden. We had no [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=63.12s)]
*  idea that Kamala was such a fool. And I have to agree with you. I'm going to have to endorse her [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=66.8s)]
*  as a Democratic nominee in 2024. We need more Kamala Harris, you know, 100 percent 81 million votes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's the most popular vice president ever. And I do have to speak to what you were saying [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  earlier, Tucker. People always say that Biden is failing America, that Biden has been a failure. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  And actually, I asked them by what metric? By our metrics, yes, right. We go to the grocery store. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=89.76s)]
*  We see the we see the prices. We go to fill up our tanks. We see the prices. Then we have people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  that are looking us in the face like their press secretary, which, by the way, did I mention she's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=98.56s)]
*  black and a woman. We should just say that because it's very important that we also acknowledge that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  We also acknowledge that. But and they look us in the face and they said that we're in the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=107.92s)]
*  midst of an economic boom. Well, they put Biden there for a reason. And I honestly believe that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  he is by their metrics, by the less metrics, he's a great success. I think he was installed just like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=116.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris in an effort to deplete the middle class, to make people suffer, to make sure that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=121.52s)]
*  people were relying more on the government. And by those metrics, actually, they've been a tremendous [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  success to keep looking at us like we're stupid and keep gaslighting the American people and saying, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=130.48s)]
*  what are you talking about? Everything's great. We're in the midst of the most historic economic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=135.12s)]
*  boom. Yeah, by those metrics, they've been a great success. I think that's really I think [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=139.12s)]
*  you're absolutely right. None of us I certainly I was not wise enough to see their intent, but it's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=143.36s)]
*  very obvious now. Guinness Jones. Great to see you tonight. Thank you very much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3ue-jxvA4&t=148.16s)]
