# Victor Davis Hanson: Democrats are party of the elite now
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw)
*  Victor Davis Hansen is a senior fellow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=0.0s)]
*  at the Hoover Institution. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=2.36s)]
*  We're always happy to have him join us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=3.2s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=5.0s)]
*  This is an about face. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=6.48s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, it's not because Tucker, they found a new agenda, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=10.66s)]
*  this new socialist agenda that was so popular. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=13.24s)]
*  I think what happened is the first thing, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=16.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party became wealthy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=18.52s)]
*  That bi-coastal elite through globalization [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=20.32s)]
*  got these global markets [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  and you have a whole professional class [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=24.64s)]
*  that's not subject to any ramifications [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=26.44s)]
*  of these utopian ideas, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=29.24s)]
*  whether it's climate change or defund the police, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=30.64s)]
*  and never boomerangs back on them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=32.96s)]
*  And then they said, well, we don't have the people, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=34.76s)]
*  but we have the institutions, corporate boardrooms, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=37.0s)]
*  Wall Street, Silicon Valley, K through 12 academia, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=39.72s)]
*  so we can influence opinion [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=42.96s)]
*  without having a majority of opinion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=45.08s)]
*  And then of course, they changed the demography. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  We've had about 40 million people come in the last 40 years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  And right now we have 50 million American residents [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=53.32s)]
*  that were not born in the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=56.32s)]
*  And they feel that the majority of them [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=58.6s)]
*  will be loyal to the Democratic Party [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=60.84s)]
*  that invited them in. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=63.28s)]
*  And still it's not enough. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=64.48s)]
*  Still they're looking at a disaster in November. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=65.94s)]
*  So now they're saying, well, you know what? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=69.76s)]
*  In good Jacobin or Bolshevik fashion, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=71.44s)]
*  we've got to re-educate young people, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  get them while they're young, indoctrinate them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=75.88s)]
*  And so they're trying to do that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=79.68s)]
*  and they want to change the system. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=81.68s)]
*  They're saying, well, if we can't indoctrinate them, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=82.88s)]
*  maybe we can get rid of the filibuster [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=84.92s)]
*  or get rid of the electoral college [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  or pack the court or have a national voting law. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=88.06s)]
*  But all of this has a common denominator. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=90.62s)]
*  And that is they are the party of the elite now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=93.06s)]
*  They're the party of the wealthy, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=95.66s)]
*  they're the party that despises the middle class. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=96.94s)]
*  And they seek power for an agenda that nobody wants. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  And they have to have these crises to do it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  January 6th or the Ukrainian War, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=105.30000000000001s)]
*  whatever the thing is, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=108.22s)]
*  they use these levers of influence and power. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  And it's still, I don't think it's gonna be enough. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=111.9s)]
*  I think they're looking at a landslide of rejection [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=113.62s)]
*  in November. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=117.18s)]
*  And I think that Elon Musk is a precursor. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=118.54s)]
*  So is the C-SPAN implosion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=121.9s)]
*  So is the Disney implosion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  So is the Netflix implosion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  So is the Virginia election implosion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  A lot of indicators, a lot of symptoms [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=129.9s)]
*  that they have a reckoning that's terrifying them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, and just in three sentences, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=135.5s)]
*  do you believe that the coming midterms will discredit [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=137.68s)]
*  not just the players, but their ideas as well? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is because you see, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=144.72s)]
*  it's not just political. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=145.96s)]
*  People, as you say, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=147.32s)]
*  they're not really interested just in the issues. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=149.16s)]
*  It's existential. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=151.56s)]
*  They can't find food that they can afford. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=152.64s)]
*  They can't fill up their car. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=154.6s)]
*  They don't feel safe when they go into a big city. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=156.32s)]
*  They don't feel their kids are being educated [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=159.92s)]
*  or they're being propagandized. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=162.52s)]
*  So it's a 360, 24 seven phenomenon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=164.6s)]
*  It's a totalitarian effort. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=167.8s)]
*  And you can see the pushback in social media, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=169.84s)]
*  you can see it was grassroots school board. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=173.04s)]
*  It's not just political. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  They feel their very lives are at stake. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=176.28s)]
*  It's not going to be sustainable [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  if these people are in control any longer [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  because they don't care. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=182.56s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't care about the price of gas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=184.48s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren doesn't care [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=187.6s)]
*  if people can't afford plywood at the lumber store. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=191.68s)]
*  They're revolutionaries, they're ideologues. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  Again, they'd rather be wrong [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  and they'd rather lose and be right than be wrong and win. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=197.56s)]
*  That's how I see it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  They'd rather be wrong and win. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  That's how ideological they are. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=204.64s)]
*  I think that's a really insightful observation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QzbKIuCGLw&t=205.48s)]
