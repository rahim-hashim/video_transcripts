# Tucker: We're moving closer to war
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's Night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  We opened the show last night with a kind of dark segment on the looming war between [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  A bipartisan coalition of neocons in Washington has been recklessly stoking conflict between [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=11.74s)]
*  those two countries for years now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=16.4s)]
*  Our foreign policy establishment, in fact, has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=18.92s)]
*  weapons to one of the most volatile regions in the world, hoping for some kind of explosion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And now, their wish seems to be coming true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=27.52s)]
*  That explosion looks like it's on its way, and it could very easily suck the United States [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=30.24s)]
*  into the center of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=34.56s)]
*  That's what we said last night. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=36.44s)]
*  But honestly, as we read those words, they seemed hard to believe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=38.12s)]
*  We're really going to fight a war over some corrupt Eastern European country that is strategically [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=41.8s)]
*  irrelevant to us? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=46.32s)]
*  With everything else that's going on right now in our own country? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=48.4s)]
*  No normal person would ever want to do anything like that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=51.8s)]
*  How could it really happen? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  We're sure not sure how it could happen, but nevertheless, it does seem to be happening [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=56.4s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=60.76s)]
*  The Biden administration has begun evacuating American civilians from Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=62.16s)]
*  The Pentagon has announced it is prepared to use force in the region. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=66.78s)]
*  So this country is now closer to a legitimate war than we have been in decades. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=70.72s)]
*  And to be clear, we're talking about an actual war here, not a protracted series of airstrikes [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=74.52s)]
*  against some impoverished dirt patch they're telling you is an existential threat to the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=78.96s)]
*  nation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=83.56s)]
*  Russia is not a rock. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=85.56s)]
*  Russia has nuclear weapons and a real army. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  A war with Russia is not a joke. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=89.2s)]
*  It won't be over in a week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=90.76s)]
*  So you'd think right now might be the time the president of the United States could explain [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  what's going on here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=98.0s)]
*  What exactly are we doing in Eastern Europe and why are we doing it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=99.44s)]
*  But no. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  In an exchange with reporters today, Joe Biden explained that he wasn't going to take any [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=104.38s)]
*  questions at all for fear that someone might ask him about Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=107.84s)]
*  By the way, the reason we're not going to have any time for questions now is these guys [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=112.84s)]
*  got to get quickly on the plane and go out and do a major announcement in Ohio. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=117.0s)]
*  And you guys will ask me all about Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=121.48s)]
*  You guys will ask me all about Russia. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=124.48s)]
*  And Joe Biden's not falling for that one again. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=126.64s)]
*  You can see why. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  A couple of days ago, he tried to talk about Russia during a press conference and he got [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  the talking points so mangled that his staff had to issue statements afterward informing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  us that Joe Biden has no idea what he's talking about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=138.22s)]
*  Biden's mistake at the press conference was suggesting that maybe war with Russia is not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=141.44s)]
*  inevitable. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=145.32s)]
*  In Washington, you're absolutely not allowed to say that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=146.6s)]
*  Donald Trump said it repeatedly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=148.72s)]
*  They impeached him for it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=150.16s)]
*  In Joe Biden's case, his handlers just stepped in and told us a brand new story. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=151.84s)]
*  Here's White House Chief of Staff and amateur comedian Ron Klain explaining that actually [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=156.6s)]
*  this is what Joe Biden meant to say. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=161.24s)]
*  And as you listen to it, you may notice that it's the opposite of what Biden actually said. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=163.24s)]
*  I think it's fair to say the White House has pretty aggressively walked back or clarified [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=169.48s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, the president's comments about Ukraine and Russia and whether [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=173.64s)]
*  the president was signaling that a minor incursion might be viewed through a different lens. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=178.32s)]
*  Whether the president meant to say that at the time or maybe he was being inarticulate, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=183.4s)]
*  can you afford any gaps given the stakes right now in all this? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=188.44s)]
*  Well, I think the president was quite clear and reiterated his point of view this morning [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=192.64s)]
*  very clearly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=197.16s)]
*  And I think that President Putin should have no doubt any move by the Russian assembled [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=198.16s)]
*  military across the border of Ukraine is an invasion. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=201.6s)]
*  It will be met with a very severe economic response from the United States and our allies. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=204.92s)]
*  So this guy called Ron Klain, whoever that is, gets to overrule the president of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=211.72s)]
*  United States on matters of foreign policy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=215.92s)]
*  Since when is he allowed to do that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=218.24s)]
*  Well, whenever he feels like it, that's the real answer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=219.88s)]
*  Joe Biden is the weakest leader this country has seen since Woodrow Wilson had a stroke [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=222.76s)]
*  in office. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=226.42s)]
*  It's a problem, but it's not the core problem. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=227.42s)]
*  The core problem is that in America, elected officials no longer decide when we go to war, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=229.44s)]
*  as in, say, a democracy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=234.26s)]
*  Instead, bureaucrats, generals, and defense contractors make those decisions, sometimes [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=236.38s)]
*  unilaterally. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=240.88s)]
*  Here's failed rock star and hilariously inept Secretary of State Tony Blinken threatening [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=241.88s)]
*  quote severe action against Russia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=247.64s)]
*  Discussion today with Mr. Lavrov was frank and substantive. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=251.44s)]
*  I conveyed the position of the United States and our European allies and partners that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=257.22s)]
*  we stand firmly with Ukraine in support of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  We've been clear. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=268.44000000000005s)]
*  If any Russian military forces move across Ukraine's border, that's a renewed invasion. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=269.94000000000005s)]
*  It will be met with swift, severe, and a united response from the United States and our partners [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  and allies. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=282.0s)]
*  So the president of the United States is not allowed to talk in public about Russia. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=285.0s)]
*  He has admitted that today. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=288.66s)]
*  He might say something that averts war. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=289.66s)]
*  So instead, the same people who've lost the last five wars get to speak for him. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=292.26s)]
*  Do you feel safer? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=297.22s)]
*  You've got to wonder what voters think of this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=298.96s)]
*  Actually, you don't need to wonder what they think. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=300.74s)]
*  Polls show that most Americans are completely opposed to fighting Russia over Ukraine because [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=302.26s)]
*  they're not demented. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=307.12s)]
*  But do you know who's very much in favor of it? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=308.12s)]
*  defense contractors, including Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin's former employer, Raytheon. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=310.62s)]
*  For defense contractors, war means massive profits, by definition. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=315.88s)]
*  In just the last few years, the U.S. has spent more than $2 billion on military aid to this [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=319.68s)]
*  nation called Ukraine that most people couldn't identify on a map. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=324.58s)]
*  Just the other day, the administration announced 200 million more. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=327.8s)]
*  So the Ukrainians love this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=332.4s)]
*  Obviously, this is the whole reason they once employed Joe Biden's otherwise unemployable [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=334.16s)]
*  to keep the cash flowing to them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=339.46s)]
*  So when Biden hinted this week that war might not be coming right away, the Ukrainians were [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=341.98s)]
*  highly distressed. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=347.02s)]
*  In fact, they were so distressed, they said so out loud. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=348.02s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=350.12s)]
*  The big concern expressed by one Ukrainian official I spoke to last night is that this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=351.12s)]
*  offers Vladimir Putin a green light, in his words, to enter Ukraine at his pleasure. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=355.62s)]
*  So the Ukrainians are complaining about American foreign policy, about what the president said [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=363.96s)]
*  at a press conference. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=369.08s)]
*  The government of some place called Ukraine is demanding that we fight the Russian army [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=370.46s)]
*  on their behalf. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=375.48s)]
*  Okay, I mean, it's not crazy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=376.48s)]
*  You could kind of see why they would want that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=378.84s)]
*  It's a lot easier than doing it themselves. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=380.68s)]
*  The question is, we're the United States, so why are we obeying them? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfyZ618Bks&t=382.96s)]
