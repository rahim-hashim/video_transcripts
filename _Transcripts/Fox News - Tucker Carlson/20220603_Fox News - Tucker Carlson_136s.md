# Rep. Steube: Gun control laws are the 'hypocrisy of the left'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A)
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=0.0s)]
*  That was one of the most amazing exchanges [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=1.6600000000000001s)]
*  I think I've ever seen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=3.16s)]
*  You're in your own home, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=4.5s)]
*  and Sheila Jackson Lee tells you to put down the gun. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=5.94s)]
*  What is this really about? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=9.14s)]
*  Well, and she also, in that bill, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=11.18s)]
*  they tell you how to store it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=12.88s)]
*  Joe Biden just talked about, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  you have to have a trigger lock. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=15.58s)]
*  So when the person is breaking into your home, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=16.66s)]
*  make sure you have your key next to you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  to get your trigger lock off your gun [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=19.86s)]
*  and respond appropriately. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=21.34s)]
*  I was trying to highlight to the American people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=22.68s)]
*  that this isn't just a magazine ban on rifles. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=25.84s)]
*  This is every single semi-automatic weapon [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=28.72s)]
*  that takes more than a 10-round magazine would be banned, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=31.08s)]
*  three of which I just happened to have, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=33.68s)]
*  and I showed to make it very clear [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=35.36s)]
*  that a 10-round magazine doesn't fit in it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  So by having the magazine banned, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=39.56s)]
*  you are effectively banning all of these handguns [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=41.12s)]
*  that millions, hundreds of millions of Americans use [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=44.16s)]
*  every single day to defend themselves, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=47.22s)]
*  them families, to protect their homesteads. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=49.04s)]
*  Why not make it really simple? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=51.86s)]
*  Why wouldn't Congress require that the laws it passes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  restricting and banning handguns [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  apply to their own bodyguards? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=58.64s)]
*  If they're sincere, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=59.92s)]
*  if high-capacity magazines are dangerous, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=61.24s)]
*  then why should Sheila Jackson Lee's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=63.42s)]
*  federally funded bodyguards get to carry them? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=65.16s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=66.92s)]
*  Well, and Cori Bush is on that committee [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=68.84s)]
*  and she spends hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=70.56s)]
*  of her campaign money every single year [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=72.4s)]
*  for bodyguards and security. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=74.8s)]
*  And I can guarantee you, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=76.28s)]
*  they are using the exact same weapons [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=77.6s)]
*  that Mr. Jones, you just highlighted, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=79.68s)]
*  talked about banning as a, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=81.6s)]
*  assault rifle or assault weapon. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=83.6s)]
*  But why shouldn't the laws apply [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=86.28s)]
*  to the people who make the laws? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  That seems like a fairly solid principle. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they absolutely should. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=94.16s)]
*  And that's the hypocrisy of the left. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=95.0s)]
*  Joe Biden has all the security, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=98.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi has all the security, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=99.64s)]
*  the Capitol police have all the security yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  They want everyday Americans like you and me [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=104.52s)]
*  at our homes, at our businesses, as we drive, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  some of us that have concealed carry permits, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=108.88s)]
*  to not be able to use the very weapons [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  that we can utilize to protect our homes, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  our families and our loved ones. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=115.02s)]
*  And that's exactly what this is all about. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=116.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's time to say no. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=118.98s)]
*  And thank you for doing that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=119.92s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=120.9s)]
*  Congressman Greg Stubbe of Florida, West Coast of Florida. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=121.74s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=123.78s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWZc84O96A&t=124.66s)]
