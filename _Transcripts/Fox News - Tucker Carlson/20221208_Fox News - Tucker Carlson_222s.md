# Tucker Carlson: Twitter routinely censored critics of the Biden admin
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we begin with an unexpected Fox News alert. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=2.52s)]
*  Just moments ago, Barry Weiss of Substack began posting part two of the Twitter files. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=4.8s)]
*  Now these are assessments of internal documents from Twitter that have been hidden under previous [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=10.76s)]
*  management but are now being exposed by Elon Musk who just bought the company. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=16.52s)]
*  So first, Musk last week gave a trove of documents to Matt Tabey of Substack and now to Barry [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=22.14s)]
*  Weiss. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=27.22s)]
*  Weiss is unpacking all of this right now live on Twitter in a Twitter thread. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=28.419999999999998s)]
*  What she has revealed so far confirms what many suspected but none knew for certain, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=33.22s)]
*  which is that Twitter routinely censored prominent critics of the Biden administration, did so [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=38.18s)]
*  in secret without telling anyone and with no factual justification whatsoever. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=43.54s)]
*  This is known as shadow banning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=49.54s)]
*  Twitter did it all the time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Now publicly they denied doing it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=52.42s)]
*  People who were being shadow banned suspected something was up but they didn't know. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=54.28s)]
*  Now officially Twitter's chief legal officer, chief censor at Twitter, Vijaya Gadde, woman [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=57.78s)]
*  who was rewarded by the Biden administration for her work on their behalf, said that, quote, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  we do not shadow ban and we certainly don't shadow ban based on political viewpoints or [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=67.18s)]
*  ideologies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=71.94s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=72.94s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=74.28s)]
*  And the documents that Barry Weiss is posting right now, including screenshots of Twitter's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=75.94s)]
*  internal censorship tools, prove that it was a lie. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=80.0s)]
*  One of Twitter's targets for shadow banning was a Stanford professor, a physician PhD [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=83.7s)]
*  called Jay Bhattachara, one of the most impressive people in American medicine, someone we've [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=88.78s)]
*  had on this show many, many times. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=93.54s)]
*  There was no justification for censoring Jay Bhattachara, except he was one of the authors [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=95.38s)]
*  of the Great Barrington Declaration, which very early in the so-called pandemic infuriated [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=100.78s)]
*  our country's public health establishment, including Tony Fauci, by opposing COVID lockdowns. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=106.2s)]
*  Jay Bhattachara has spent his career studying the health effects of various policies on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=112.7s)]
*  vulnerable populations. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=117.62s)]
*  So he knew that COVID lockdowns would harm children, and he said so. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=119.62s)]
*  That has turned out to be true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=124.66s)]
*  But Twitter, doubtless at the request of the authorities, shadow banned Professor Bhattachara [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=126.42s)]
*  of Stanford for saying this out loud. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=131.9s)]
*  They prevented his tweets from trending, and that meant that most users could not see his [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=134.38s)]
*  tweets, though they were factual. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  Twitter also shadow banned Fox's Dan Bongino. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=141.02s)]
*  According to Weiss, Twitter at one point slapped Bongino with a search ban. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  That made it impossible for users of Twitter to find tweets by Dan Bongino. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=148.06s)]
*  Because they were inaccurate? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=154.18s)]
*  No. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=155.5s)]
*  Because they were accurate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=156.5s)]
*  That was the crime. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=157.74s)]
*  That's always the crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=158.74s)]
*  They never punish you for lying. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=160.18s)]
*  They only punish you for telling the truth. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=161.38s)]
*  Twitter also flagged Charlie Kirk's account with a do not amplify tag. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  Weiss reports that, quote, the group that decided whether to limit the reach of certain [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  users was the Strategic Response Team, Global Escalation Team, or SRT, G-E-T. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=172.18s)]
*  The team often handled up to 200 separate cases a day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=179.94s)]
*  Another group within Twitter called Site Integrity Policy Policy Escalation Support, notice the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=185.38s)]
*  bureaucratic handles here, it's like the military, that group also hadn't handled shadow banning. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=189.94s)]
*  And that group included Gaudet, as well as Twitter executives Yoel Roth and Praag Agarwal, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=195.44s)]
*  who ran the company. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  None of this has been previously known. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=201.88s)]
*  It was never disclosed to the public. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=203.68s)]
*  Weiss' threat is ongoing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=206.12s)]
*  It's being updated as we speak. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=207.4s)]
*  And of course, we'll bring you more information as we get it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTU7qswsM8&t=208.8s)]
