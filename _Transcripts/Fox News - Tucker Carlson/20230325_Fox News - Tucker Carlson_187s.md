# Tucker: Philosopher explains how the strategy of creating a crisis is incredibly effective
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM)
*  Eva Vlaardingerbroek is a Dutch legal philosopher who lives in the middle of a society in Europe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=0.0s)]
*  that's being transformed by the climate agenda. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=4.76s)]
*  Eva, I appreciate you're coming on tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Is it clear to people in Europe that this is just a straight out power play by the Chinese [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=8.64s)]
*  government to displace the West? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=12.0s)]
*  No, not clear enough, I'm afraid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=14.48s)]
*  I don't think that they see through the real agenda behind this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=17.16s)]
*  And obviously, you know, these people know only how to rule by fear. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=20.68s)]
*  So what is happening is not just China, but also our government officials, you know, our [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=25.44s)]
*  elites obviously benefit from a fearful society, from fearful people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  People are afraid that the world is going to end because what is a better way to get [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  people to comply to the things that you say that they have to do than by, you know, having [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=39.44s)]
*  them actually fear for their lives? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=43.8s)]
*  You know, that's always the globalist tragedy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=45.4s)]
*  We've seen it with COVID, but the climate is probably even more effective because, well, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=48.68s)]
*  if you really believe that the world's going to end, you know, what is there that you wouldn't [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  do in order to save the planet? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=56.32s)]
*  And so that strategy of creating a crisis, you know, of saying, well, we have an emergency [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=58.98s)]
*  and it needs to be solved now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=64.38s)]
*  We are on thin ice. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=65.94s)]
*  We're all going to die. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=67.58s)]
*  You know, that's incredibly effective. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=68.58s)]
*  And the solution that they always present you with is that we, us ordinary people, have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=70.74s)]
*  to give up our rights, our property, and our freedom in order to solve this so-called crisis. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=76.74s)]
*  You know, it's always a rules for the but not for me type of situation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=83.7s)]
*  That is why we are the only ones that will end up not eating meat, not flying anymore, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=88.5s)]
*  not being allowed to drive our cars. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=93.02s)]
*  But for them, nothing ever changes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=95.22s)]
*  I just got to wonder how the people who are pushing this, and I think some of them are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=98.26s)]
*  doing it in good faith. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=101.7s)]
*  I think they're really afraid the end of the world is coming and they blame themselves. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=102.7s)]
*  But how do they explain China building two new coal plants a week? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=105.94s)]
*  Why is that cool in a world in which carbon dioxide is considered poison? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=109.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=115.06s)]
*  Well, you can't explain it, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=116.06s)]
*  So that shows you that there is a different agenda behind this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=117.86s)]
*  You know, you can't argue with these people rationally, really. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=121.13999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that you can't, you know, the fact that, for example, in the Netherlands, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  you know, you've all seen what happens to our Dutch farmers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=128.42s)]
*  We are such a tiny little country, yet our government says that we are the biggest nitrogen [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=132.84s)]
*  polluter in the world and that all of our farms need to be gone by 2030 to solve this [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=137.56s)]
*  so-called crisis, you know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=144.76s)]
*  And Germany, for example, is not even subjected to those rules. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=146.82s)]
*  So all of this is completely arbitrary. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  So we need to think past the lies that they are trying to sell us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=151.5s)]
*  You know, we need to wake up to the real agenda behind this, and that is, well, I'm sad to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  say it, but very simple one. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=159.9s)]
*  It's always about money and it's always about power. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=161.5s)]
*  When they tell you to get rid of your farms, I think that's a red flag. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't think I'm paranoid. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=169.98s)]
*  You referred to Germany or Brooke. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=170.98s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=173.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHJFC_yjoM&t=174.38s)]
