# The Jan. 6 committee knew they were wrong: Harmeet Dhillon
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA)
*  In October, the January 6th committee issued a subpoena to Donald Trump seeking access [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=0.0s)]
*  to various records from his time in the White House. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=7.88s)]
*  This was a clear violation of the principle of separation of powers and it was done for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=11.28s)]
*  political reasons. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=16.1s)]
*  So Hermit Dillon filed a lawsuit against the January 6th committee to contest the subpoena [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=17.84s)]
*  and this week the committee backed down and withdrew that subpoena. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Hermit Dillon is the head of Dillon Law Group. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=27.2s)]
*  She's also running to be chair of the RNC. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Hermit, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=32.28s)]
*  I wonder if you could just start off with a little bit of context for those at home [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=35.08s)]
*  who wonder what was the big deal about this subpoena? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=38.64s)]
*  Why did it warrant a lawsuit and why is it important for the country that you prevailed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  in this lawsuit? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you for asking Tulsi. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  So this January 6th committee, as we all know, has been going on for a year and a half and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=50.92s)]
*  I would call it an extended advertisement with no actual legal significance but all [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=55.48s)]
*  political by the January 6th committee and the Democrats. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=62.68s)]
*  They pretty much used it as a commercial for their own side for the midterm election. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=65.64s)]
*  So now the only correct purpose of a House select committee investigation is really towards [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=70.92s)]
*  legislation and in this case the one piece of legislation that came out of the January [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=79.52s)]
*  6th committee was passed in September having to do with the Electoral Count Act. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=84.44s)]
*  And so after that is when they issued the subpoena for Donald Trump and sought extensive [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=90.6s)]
*  records, I mean to the point it probably would have been hundreds of thousands of documents [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  from his presidency. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=100.28s)]
*  And so the reason why we fought back is really to stand for the principle of separation of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=101.92s)]
*  powers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=106.64s)]
*  And this is not the first time that a president or former president has been subpoenaed by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=107.64s)]
*  the House and it would have been the first time that one actually testified if he had [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=112.36s)]
*  gone forward and had not quashed the subpoena. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=116.32s)]
*  In fact, President Truman many years ago was also subpoenaed after he left office and he [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=118.88s)]
*  very clearly articulated the same principles that we did in our lawsuit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=124.16s)]
*  So in addition to being over broad, in addition to being vague, in addition to not pursuing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=127.56s)]
*  a proper legislative purpose, we articulated separation of powers issues and we filed that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=133.92s)]
*  lawsuit in Florida where President Trump lives. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=138.24s)]
*  Some people are saying, oh, Harmeet, they just let the clock run out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=142.04s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=145.16s)]
*  But actually, if the House wanted to fight our lawsuit, they could have immediately stepped [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=146.16s)]
*  up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=150.4s)]
*  They were served promptly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=151.4s)]
*  They could have stepped up and engaged with us and had a court ruling on the issue. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=152.4s)]
*  They did not want a court ruling on the issue. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=155.6s)]
*  They knew they were wrong. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=157.68s)]
*  They knew they were likely to lose. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=158.68s)]
*  And as a result, they never fought us in court and they had to back down yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=160.44s)]
*  So we're very pleased with the results for the office of the presidency and for the concept [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=164.24s)]
*  of separation of powers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=169.4s)]
*  Harmeet, their reaction response literally proves your point, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=172.0s)]
*  That this was about political moves before the election. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=177.12s)]
*  It was about posturing and it was about continuing to show their own political objectives that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=180.48s)]
*  they were pursuing, knowing that it was a futile effort from the beginning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=185.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for your expertise and your leadership and voice on this and so many other [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=189.84s)]
*  issues. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=195.12s)]
*  Thank you, Tulsi. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=196.12s)]
*  To catch our nightly opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=201.0s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDS1_fOhLmA&t=206.44s)]
