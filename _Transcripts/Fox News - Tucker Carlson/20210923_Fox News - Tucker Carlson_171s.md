# Glenn Greenwald rips liberal media for 'lying' about Hunter Biden emails
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4)
*  Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist, very independent. He writes on Substack, he joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=0.0s)]
*  So Glenn, I mean, I don't think you're shocked by this, but you do have to ask why are they telling us this now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=5.86s)]
*  The evidence was overwhelming from the very beginning Tucker that the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=15.22s)]
*  emails were authentic and yet they lied and lied and lied as you just showed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=19.54s)]
*  trying to convince people to not even pay attention to them on the grounds that they were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=23.5s)]
*  disinformation that the emails were fake. Now the new book that just came out is from this young reporter at Politico [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=27.18s)]
*  who spent months digging into all of these emails and obviously had he unearthed proof that these emails were forgeries and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=33.74s)]
*  put that in his book, he would be a star. You would know his name, he'd be a household name, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=41.34s)]
*  he'd be on every TV show, but because his reporting said the opposite, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=45.78s)]
*  he found even more proof that all those emails were authentic, which meant that these media outlets, all of them pretty much, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=49.1s)]
*  with a few exceptions, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=55.98s)]
*  deliberately lied to the public in the weeks before the election by telling them that this was Russian disinformation when they knew it wasn't true. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=57.82s)]
*  They're ignoring his book. He's not a right-wing journalist. He's from one of those mainstream publications. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  He has the proof in his hands that they all lied and they don't want anyone to know it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=70.06s)]
*  Do you honestly think that if you're NBC News, if you're CNN, if you're the New York Times, the Washington Post, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=75.62s)]
*  can you just sort of move forward as if you didn't participate in a lying campaign to influence a political election? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=80.98s)]
*  You know, as you know, Tucker, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  I was at the media outlet that I founded when this all happened and they were the ones who published as well [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=91.18s)]
*  the claim that this was Russian disinformation and that a week later told me that I couldn't report on this story [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=96.22s)]
*  because the documents weren't verified in contrast to the CIA lie that they had published. So all throughout the media, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=101.42s)]
*  this is their prevailing mindset. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=107.9s)]
*  They know that they have an audience filled with liberals who hate Donald Trump and the Trump movement and their only business model is to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=109.42s)]
*  aggrandize those people and they know that even if they lie and get caught lying, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=116.22s)]
*  their audience and readers don't care, in fact, like them even more because they believe they're on the right side. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=120.82s)]
*  So you have a huge numbers of journalists who believe that they have the right to lie and even when they get caught, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=126.38s)]
*  they don't care because they know their audience won't hold it against them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=132.18s)]
*  You came on, I think, immediately after you left the Intercept and I thought it was sad then, but looking back on it, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=135.26s)]
*  the media outlet that you founded [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=140.26s)]
*  tried to make you lie or prevented you from telling the truth. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that just really sums up the moment we're living in. I'm really sorry that you went through that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=146.66s)]
*  I just think it's awful in every way, but you're thriving, obviously. Glenn Greenwald, thank you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=150.7s)]
*  The most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglQmOeBXG4&t=165.26s)]
