# Tulsi Gabbard: Some feminists are exercising the 'height of hypocricsy'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s)
*  With this much pressure being exerted on our society at all times, a lot of public figures [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=0.0s)]
*  just give up and become pathetic herd animals. But some of them become a lot more impressive, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=4.72s)]
*  much deeper and more profound. And speaking of that, Tulsi Gabbard posted this video online [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=10.88s)]
*  today. We saw it. We thought you might want to also. Here it is. Today's self-proclaimed feminists [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=15.44s)]
*  will not define what a woman is and are unfortunately actively seeking to erase the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=21.04s)]
*  progress that Title IX has made over the last 50 years by essentially trying to erase women [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=27.04s)]
*  as an entire category of people. Well, that's right. I mean, that's what's going on underneath [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=32.32s)]
*  the headlines. And so we wanted to ask Tulsi Gabbard more about it. She's a former member [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=39.28s)]
*  of Congress, of course, ran for president, and we're happy to have her tonight. Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=42.56s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on. So why did you say this? What was it in response to? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=46.32s)]
*  And how long have you been thinking about this? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Oh, this has been an ongoing issue, Tucker. As you know, I served in Congress for eight years, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=56.72s)]
*  and this has been something that's building and growing over time. I introduced legislation, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=61.2s)]
*  bipartisan legislation, while I was in Congress out of a recognition of this problem, that we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=65.68s)]
*  have people who claim to be feminists, yet who are exercising the height of hypocrisy by actually [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=71.68s)]
*  trying to erase women as an entire category of people and doing so by doing things like the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=78.8s)]
*  Biden administration is doing now in trying to undo Title IX, the legislation that was enacted [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=85.6s)]
*  50 years ago out of a recognition of the difference in biological sex between men and women and boys [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=91.2s)]
*  and girls. And so my legislation, very simply called the Protect Women's Sports Act, upheld [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=97.92s)]
*  that original intent of Title IX, ensuring that sports would be maintained with that original [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=104.8s)]
*  intent with females competing against females, males competing against males. And so the video [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=110.72s)]
*  I posted this morning was part of a podcast interview that I did with one of the nation's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=116.24s)]
*  top female swimmers, Riley Gaines, who has direct experience of the consequences of what this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=121.52s)]
*  administration is doing in that she was forced to compete against a biological male for the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=127.28s)]
*  national championship and how basically how she was sidelined in the interest of this fear [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=133.6s)]
*  filled culture where you've just got to go along to get along no matter the fact that you're [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=141.2s)]
*  actually denying the existence of objective truth that you've got a six-four male with male parts [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=146.0s)]
*  competing and swimming against women in college and being given the podium and the medal while [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=151.84s)]
*  the women are being sidelined. It really is a crashing defeat for what we were told feminism [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=158.16s)]
*  was and I have to wonder, I mean it's the opposite as always of what they claim it is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any sense of the motive behind this? Why would anyone want to do this? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a great question. The people who are propagating this, I'm sure they have their own [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=177.68s)]
*  motives that go actually much deeper than this issue of denying women, denying motherhood, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=182.88s)]
*  trying to actually change our language so that we actually erase the word woman and mother and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=190.48s)]
*  sister from our vocabulary. The underlying danger here is the denial of objective truth [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=196.24s)]
*  and once we as a society allow this to occur that we no longer believe that what is true is true [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=202.88s)]
*  then what we're left with is no boundaries, no moral boundaries and those in power being in a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=210.48s)]
*  position where they and only they define and tell us what is true and what is false and we end up [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=216.32s)]
*  with pure insanity. Yes, they're God in other words and they define what reality is. Exactly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=222.24s)]
*  That is so smart. Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard tonight, thank you so much. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35AFKS5j_s&t=227.36s)]
