# Tennessee man eating only McDonalds for 100 days to lose weight
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo)
*  You may recall the documentary called Super Sized Me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=0.0s)]
*  It was about eating McDonald's full time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=4.04s)]
*  It inspired one man in Nashville called Kevin McGinnis. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=5.84s)]
*  He's hoping the McDonald's diet [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=8.64s)]
*  will super downsize his body. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=10.34s)]
*  He's eating only McDonald's for 100 days to lose weight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=12.44s)]
*  And he reports back it's quote, absolutely working. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=17.0s)]
*  Kevin McGinnis blogs about his diet. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=20.3s)]
*  He's a brave man. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=22.6s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=24.1s)]
*  Kevin, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=24.94s)]
*  So it's a, I'm saying I don't believe you, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=26.36s)]
*  by the way you look fit and vigorous I will say [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=29.7s)]
*  in a non creepy way. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=32.46s)]
*  But how are you keeping? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=33.42s)]
*  Because you can't see my belly, so. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=34.26s)]
*  How are you keeping fit on McDonald's? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=35.62s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=39.62s)]
*  So literally the concept, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  I was a boxer, I wrestled in school and you'd have to cut. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=44.34s)]
*  You have to cut to make weight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=46.78s)]
*  So cutting the calories, cutting the food in half. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  If I ate three meals a day, I cut them in half. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=50.5s)]
*  And I seek the heat before I eat. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=53.22s)]
*  Meaning I wait until that heat in your stomach [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=55.34s)]
*  that says you're hungry. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=58.3s)]
*  Everyone else calls it hunger. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=60.14s)]
*  I call it my incinerator turning on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  to get rid of all the excess [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=62.34s)]
*  and also burn off some of the fat off my body. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=64.26s)]
*  And then I'll have that next meal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=66.9s)]
*  No eating hours, no counting, no measuring. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  Just cut the meals in half. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=72.48s)]
*  Eat three of them a day when you're hungry. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=73.94s)]
*  And my belief is we'll be 50 pounds down [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=76.06s)]
*  by the end of the 100 days. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=79.12s)]
*  Better blood work and better health. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=80.42s)]
*  If you don't believe me, follow along, let's find out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=82.7s)]
*  That's just unbelievable. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=85.58s)]
*  So really the essential ingredient is self-control. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=87.5s)]
*  You're approaching McDonald's in the way that I never have, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=90.22s)]
*  which is with restraint. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=92.82s)]
*  So how do you handle breakfast? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, so breakfast is go to McDonald's, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=98.22s)]
*  order any breakfast menu item. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  So order the meal, including a dessert, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=102.86s)]
*  If you wanna have the pastry, whatever. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=105.41999999999999s)]
*  But then cutting it in half. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  And at first, the first three or four days, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=108.58s)]
*  wrap up the other half, get it out of sight, out of mind. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=110.28s)]
*  And just eat the half and then save the other half [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=112.69999999999999s)]
*  till later, eat that for lunch [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=114.78s)]
*  or save it for the next day's breakfast, whatever. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=116.16s)]
*  And then just eat, again, each meal, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=118.12s)]
*  only half of whatever that whole meal would be. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=120.36s)]
*  At McDonald's, cut it in half, save the other half. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  After you've done it for about three or four days, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=125.48s)]
*  your stomach will have shrunk a little bit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=127.4s)]
*  And then you can just eat the half [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=128.8s)]
*  and you can wrap up the other half [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=129.96s)]
*  after you've eaten half of it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=131.34s)]
*  Either way is fine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=132.68s)]
*  Two questions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=134.36s)]
*  Are you worried this will kill you is the obvious one. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=135.32s)]
*  And second, how does McDonald's leftovers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=137.96s)]
*  taste the next day? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=141.04s)]
*  So on the leftovers, I'll answer that one first. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=142.88s)]
*  Definitely putting the sandwich in the microwave [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  with a little cup of water [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  so it actually steams a little bit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  Really good for the sandwiches. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  For me, I like the softer. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=151.48s)]
*  You can put the whole thing in an air fryer [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=152.48s)]
*  for the fries and hash browns, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  either air fryer or dry skillet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=156.28s)]
*  And it turns them right back to almost brand new again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  So they're really good. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  As far as is it gonna kill me? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=162.2s)]
*  Did the blood work at the beginning. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=164.0s)]
*  We'll do blood work throughout. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=165.72s)]
*  My belief is that it's gonna absolutely improve [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=167.28s)]
*  the blood work throughout the whole process. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=170.32s)]
*  Cause by waiting, go ahead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=172.48s)]
*  No, that's it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=175.24s)]
*  You're a wrestler. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=176.12s)]
*  Obviously you're an Ironman, a brave man too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtudG7gulo&t=176.96s)]
