# Tucker: Why are we funding this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. If you had told us just four days ago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=0.0s)]
*  that the Biden administration was funding secret bio labs in Ukraine of all places, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=4.88s)]
*  we would not have believed you. Yeah, I don't think we're going to put that on TV. No thanks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=10.0s)]
*  Then if you told us that not only did the administration fund these secret bio labs in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=14.64s)]
*  Ukraine, but that they then failed to secure the deadly contents of those labs before the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=19.2s)]
*  Russian invasion, an invasion they knew was coming, an invasion they helped encourage, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=25.28s)]
*  if you had told us that four days ago, we would have dismissed you as a nut. It was just too [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=29.36s)]
*  preposterous. We would not want anything to do with a story like that. There was no way it could [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  be true. It's too far out. In any case, we already knew for a fact that that story was false. How do [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=37.6s)]
*  we know that? Because we read USA Today, America's newspaper. Within hours of the Russian invasion, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=43.2s)]
*  USA Today published a rebuttal to all those crazies who are yammering on about secret Ukrainian [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=48.96s)]
*  bio labs. Here was the headline. Fact check. False claim of US bio labs in Ukraine tied to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=53.84s)]
*  Russian disinformation campaign. So if you look carefully at the story, and we did because we [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  were interested, you notice that this fact check was sourced to Ukrainian government unnamed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  officials, and then Biden State Department officials. These were not exactly objective [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  sources on this subject. But still, the story seemed definitive. It was totally emphatic. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Quote, Russia has teamed up with China to further amplify the false claim of US labs in Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=81.36s)]
*  Okay, USA Today says it's Russian disinformation. Maybe it is. On to the next story. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=88.88s)]
*  But the fact checks didn't stop. That was weird. We kept seeing the same fact check [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=95.44s)]
*  again and again. It was almost like despite endless official clarification, some people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=99.52s)]
*  refused to believe the Biden administration. They preferred Russian propaganda instead. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=105.68s)]
*  And we assume they must be QAnon members. We assume that because Foreign Policy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  Magazine told us that. According to Foreign Policy, QAnon, whatever that is, was frantically [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  disseminating, quote, false claims of US bio warfare labs in Ukraine. Those labs obviously [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=119.92s)]
*  didn't exist. It was all just another lie from the Russians who lie for a living. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  Then the European Union weighed in, throwing its credibility behind the same claim. These [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=131.76s)]
*  are conspiracy theories, the EU told us. They're lies spread by Putin. An EU spokesman then [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=136.4s)]
*  reminded us that, quote, the credibility of information provided by the Kremlin is in general [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=142.16s)]
*  very doubtful and low. That was good to know. Quote, Russian disinformation has a track record [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=147.12s)]
*  of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged secret labs. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=152.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're not going to do a segment about secret labs in Ukraine. The last thing we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=157.92s)]
*  want to do on this show is traffic and Russian disinformation spread by QAnon. So we took [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  a pass on that story. And that's where things stood until yesterday when we happened to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  tune into a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Toria Nuland was testifying, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=171.04s)]
*  so we were interested. Nuland's one of the people who brought us the Iraq War, never [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  apologized for that, and kept getting promoted because that's how DC works. Toria Nuland [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  is now Joe Biden's undersecretary of state in charge of the United States. She's the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  undersecretary of state in charge of Ukraine, and she knows a lot about Ukraine. In 2014, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=187.36s)]
*  Toria Nuland engineered a coup in Ukraine in the name of democracy, of course. So she is a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  highly informed source about Ukraine. So she was having this colloquy with Senator Marco Rubio [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  of Florida during her testimony. And at one point, Rubio took a tack that we were not expecting at [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=202.56s)]
*  all. He asked Nuland if Ukraine had biological weapons. We never imagined Ukraine would have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  weapons. Why would Ukraine have bio weapons? So it seemed like a pretty strange question. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=214.88s)]
*  But it wasn't half as shocking as the answer he got. Watch what Toria Nuland said. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=219.84s)]
*  Oh, does Ukraine have biological weapons? Ukraine has biological research facilities. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=244.72s)]
*  What? You mean secret biolabs? Like the secret biolabs Ukraine definitely doesn't have? Ukraine [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=269.44s)]
*  has those? Yes, it does. And not only does Ukraine have secret biolabs, Toria Nuland said, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=278.16s)]
*  whatever they're doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is, quote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=284.32s)]
*  quite concerned that the so-called research material inside those biolabs might fall into [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=288.8s)]
*  the hands of Russian forces. Trying to tease profanity on the air to describe our reaction, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=295.04s)]
*  our jaws drop. Let's leave it there. Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Nuland just [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=300.8s)]
*  confirmed that the Russian disinformation they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=306.0s)]
*  theory and crazy and immoral to believe is in fact totally and completely true. Whoa. You don't hear [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=310.8s)]
*  things like that every day in Washington. Talk about a showstopper and a dozen questions instantly [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=318.72s)]
*  jump to mind. What exactly are they doing in these secret Ukrainian biolabs? Ukraine is the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=323.68s)]
*  poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=329.68s)]
*  weren't pharmaceutical labs, probably not developing new leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=334.8s)]
*  we would assume, because you all but said it, that there is a military application to this research, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=340.16s)]
*  that they were working on bioweapons. Again, your answer suggests that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=344.16s)]
*  Why would we fund something like that in Ukraine? And why didn't you secure the contents of these [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=347.44s)]
*  biolabs before the Russians arrived as you knew they would? And then why did you go out of your [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=355.92s)]
*  way to lie to the American public about all of this? If the, quote, research materials in these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=361.04s)]
*  labs were to escape somehow, and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=366.32s)]
*  on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world? How can we prepare for the consequences of that, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=371.2s)]
*  this thing that you're worried about? Shouldn't we be preparing? Because as it turns out, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=377.04s)]
*  we've just spent the last two years living with a pathogen that began in another foreign biolab [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  funded by the United States government secretly. So this question is on our mind. It seems fair. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  Now that's some of what we would have asked if we were US senators, which we're not. Yes, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=391.6s)]
*  there's a time limit. Time limit be damned because this is kind of important. But Rubio did not ask [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=396.16s)]
*  those questions. Instead, he changed the subject and told us once again that Vladimir Putin is bad. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=402.4s)]
*  Watch. If there's a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=407.84s)]
*  is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  guy what they're planning to do themselves. Okay, just to get a pen. It's a classic [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=426.16s)]
*  Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they are planning to do themselves. That's what [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=434.8s)]
*  Toria Nuland said. We almost laughed out loud. So what you're saying, Toria Nuland, if for example, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=440.24s)]
*  you were funding secret biolabs in Ukraine, but wanted to hide that fact from the people who are [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=446.72s)]
*  paying for it in whose name you were doing it, then you might lie about it by claiming the Russians [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=451.36s)]
*  were lying about it. In other words, you might mount a disinformation campaign by claiming the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=455.76s)]
*  other guy was mounting a disinformation campaign. Is that what you're saying, Toria Nuland? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=460.64s)]
*  It's pretty funny. What's not funny is that this is all entirely real. We invited Marco Rubio on [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=465.12s)]
*  this show tonight to tell us what he knows about these biolabs. He declined to come. That invitation [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=471.36s)]
*  remains open. In the meantime, let's review what little we do know about this. We're going to start [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=476.64s)]
*  with a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday. Now, we would never do this. We never [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=483.04s)]
*  played anything like this on the show before because, of course, we're Americans and we want [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  to know what's going on. We ask our own officials, the people we elect and whose salaries we pay, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  because it's our country. We don't go to foreign sources because we trust our own sources first. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=498.24s)]
*  But when it turns out the people who represent us and run our government are lying to us and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  never apologize for it and doing horrific things in our names, then you have to open your mind a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=508.08s)]
*  little bit and at least assess what other people are saying. So here was the Russian claim. Watch. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=514.24s)]
*  During the course of the special military operation, facts were uncovered of the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=520.24s)]
*  Kiev regime mopping up traces of military biological program under development in Ukraine, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=523.52s)]
*  financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry. Okay, so that apparently, we hadn't seen that until [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=528.48s)]
*  this afternoon we started poking around. That may have been the root of the conspiracy theories [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=536.08s)]
*  that the fact checks told us were Russian disinformation. Let's quote it. Military [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=542.24s)]
*  biological programs are under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  That's the Russian claim. Separately, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said the Ukrainians [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=552.24s)]
*  are working on deadly pathogens, including plague and anthrax. Is that true? Now, obviously, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=557.2s)]
*  we would not take Russia's word for that, ever, but we don't have to take Russia's word for that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=562.32s)]
*  The U.S. Defense Department has a website that contains this media clip about the opening of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=569.84s)]
*  a biological research facility in Ukraine in 2010. Quote, U.S. Senator Dick Lugar applauded the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=574.72s)]
*  opening of the interim central reference laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine this week, announcing that it [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=581.12s)]
*  will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists. The level three [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=586.32s)]
*  biosafety lab will be used to study anthrax, tulameria, and Q fever, as well as other dangerous [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  pathogens. Oh, okay. Then the National Pulse dug up a 2011 report from the U.S. National Academy [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  of Sciences that also explained that the Odessa-based laboratory, quote, is responsible for the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=606.72s)]
*  identification of especially dangerous biological pathogens. So what we're doing, this is not the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=612.0s)]
*  first time you've heard this story. We are funding the creation of deadly pathogens so we can study [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=618.56s)]
*  them and prevent people from getting infected with them, maybe? There are lots of examples of this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=624.2399999999999s)]
*  The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has a handy webpage explaining that American and Ukrainian scientists [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=630.88s)]
*  have worked on a whole bunch of different experiments like this. Some of the projects [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=635.68s)]
*  include work on African swine fever virus, hemorrhagic fever virus, and various avian [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  respiratory viruses. The interesting thing, the telling thing, is that the U.S. Embassy's website [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=644.88s)]
*  also contains links to fact sheets about America's support for biological research in Ukraine, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=650.72s)]
*  but all those links are now dead. That's weird. It's our government. We pay for it. Again, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=656.72s)]
*  they're there in our name, in the name of American citizens, but we can no longer read their webpage? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=662.24s)]
*  How does that work exactly? They have no right to lie to us. The webpage is archived, thankfully, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=668.08s)]
*  and the fact sheets show Defense Department funding to laboratories in Ukraine. So that looks like [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=672.64s)]
*  proof. It's not Russian disinformation. It's totally real. Sorry, USA Today, America's newspaper. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=678.4s)]
*  It's real. You can look it up on the internet if you want. In the face of that evidence, the Pentagon [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  is still lying about it, and in fact, they're repeating the same unbelievably stupid and now [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  thoroughly discredited lies the fact checkers have told for weeks now. Here's the spokesman for the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=695.52s)]
*  Pentagon, John Kirby, today. The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable, and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=700.8s)]
*  in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  It's classic Russian propaganda, and if I were you, I wouldn't give it a drop of ink worth paying [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  attention to. Can you explain to us what it has? Has there been any relationship between the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=727.84s)]
*  Americans? We are not developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine. It's not happening. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=733.36s)]
*  If I were you, I wouldn't devote a drop of ink to it. First of all, you didn't get to make that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=743.44s)]
*  decision, Mr. Bureaucrat. We have a free press in this country. You don't get to decide, but you'll [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  notice at the end of that, Kirby refuses to answer the question. Has there been a relationship [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=754.56s)]
*  between the U.S. Pentagon and a bio weapons facility in Ukraine, and if so, what is that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=761.1199999999999s)]
*  relationship? That's Russian disinformation. What's the answer? We're not developing WMD in Ukraine [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=767.28s)]
*  right now. Okay, got it. But why are we funding this, and what exactly are we funding? We reached [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=773.1199999999999s)]
*  out to the State Department separately, and they provided us with this very carefully worded [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=778.88s)]
*  statement. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=782.72s)]
*  What's the difference exactly? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=803.12s)]
*  continuing the quote, these institutions counter biological threats throughout the country. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=804.16s)]
*  End quote. So that means nothing. You could describe our nuclear stockpile correctly as [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=810.64s)]
*  defensive. Our nuclear weapons are not designed to preemptively kill anybody. They're designed [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=815.76s)]
*  to prevent other people from killing us, but they're still nuclear weapons. So why don't you [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=821.04s)]
*  stop lying and telling us what's going on here? And why don't you more specifically tell us why [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=826.0s)]
*  you didn't secure these materials? So yes, we're funding secret biolabs in Ukraine, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=830.0s)]
*  but they're diagnostic and biodefense laboratories that counter biological threats. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=837.12s)]
*  Okay. If these are purely defensive labs, why was Toria Nuland so concerned that Russians would get [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=842.32s)]
*  ahold of the materials from these facilities? Other world powers have come to the obvious [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=848.0s)]
*  conclusion. Again, we hate to do this, but under these circumstances, we asked our own spokespeople, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=853.68s)]
*  they lied. We're going to the foreign ministry of China, a country we despise. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=859.44s)]
*  Here's what they said today. They're calling on weapons inspectors to take a look at these [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=864.72s)]
*  facilities in Ukraine right away. Over the past two decades, the United States has been blocking [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=868.48s)]
*  the establishment of a verification regime to the biological weapons convention and refused to accept [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  the inspection of biological facilities within and outside its borders. The move has further [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=881.84s)]
*  aggravated the concern of the international community. We once again urge the U.S. to provide [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=888.0s)]
*  full clarification of its biomilitarization activities within and outside its borders [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=893.76s)]
*  and accept multilateral verification. Oh, they're putting Russian Chinese propaganda on the screen. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=900.32s)]
*  Yeah, we did. We also put U.S. government propaganda on the screen. And the difference is [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=908.16s)]
*  we expect to be lied to by foreign governments. We're not globalists. We believe in one country. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=914.4s)]
*  It's this country, the United States. We do not expect to be lied to by our government, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=919.6s)]
*  and we won't accept it. But let's get to the substance of what the Chinese government just [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=923.84s)]
*  said. And we never agree with the Chinese government on anything, but in this case, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=929.52s)]
*  they make a fair point. We now know that dangerous biological agents, whether you call them weapons [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=932.64s)]
*  or not, is completely irrelevant because they can be used as weapons. Is a gun a weapon? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=937.6s)]
*  Not when you're quail hunting. When you're in a gunfight, it is. It's a ridiculous semantic debate. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=942.0s)]
*  Dangerous biological agents remain, thanks to the Biden administration, unsecured in a chaotic war [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=947.04s)]
*  zone. At some point, we need to know how that happened. Who made those decisions? We have a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=953.6s)]
*  right to know. And let's hope someone in Congress, apparently not Marco Rubio, but someone else, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=959.12s)]
*  will get to the bottom of it. But in the meantime, we pray that somewhere in the United States [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=963.12s)]
*  government, there is an adult who cares enough to get this situation under control immediately. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AugzqXPYaOc&t=968.0s)]
