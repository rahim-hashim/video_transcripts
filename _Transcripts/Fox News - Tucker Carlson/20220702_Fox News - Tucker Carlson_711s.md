# Brett Favre: It was my best game
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're nearing 200 interviews, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=2.32s)]
*  believe it or not, for Tucker Carlson today [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=4.58s)]
*  over on Fox Nation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=5.98s)]
*  These are extended and very wide ranging interviews [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=7.4s)]
*  with people who never have time to sit down [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=10.16s)]
*  on a regular nightly show here on Fox. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=12.14s)]
*  That includes some of the most prominent entertainers, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=14.38s)]
*  authors, thinkers, and generally interesting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=16.76s)]
*  entertaining people of our time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=19.2s)]
*  You may have seen a couple of minutes of these interviews [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=20.56s)]
*  because we broadcast them at night sometimes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=22.52s)]
*  But on this show, this evening, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=25.34s)]
*  we're focusing on just two people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=26.72s)]
*  The first is football legend Brett Favre, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=28.36s)]
*  and the second is Hollywood actor John Voight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=30.96s)]
*  And we're bringing you two extended portions right now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=33.4s)]
*  so you can get a sense of what our Fox Nation show [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=35.76s)]
*  is all about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=38.8s)]
*  Here is part one of our conversation with Brett Favre. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  ["Dreams of a New World"] [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=43.72s)]
*  Who was your dad? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=48.6s)]
*  What was he like? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=49.44s)]
*  Well, as I explained to you last night, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  if you're familiar with Gomer Pyle, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=53.72s)]
*  and our generation or older, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=57.28s)]
*  certainly as familiar with Gomer Pyle, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=59.76s)]
*  Sergeant Carter, who yelled, had a flat top, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=62.44s)]
*  was constantly, everything he said was yelling, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=66.56s)]
*  even when he was polite and speaking softly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=71.08s)]
*  That was my dad. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=73.92s)]
*  He was my baseball coach. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  He coached American Legion baseball for 35, 40 years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=78.16s)]
*  And he coached high school football for about 35 years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=82.42s)]
*  And so me and my two brothers, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=86.68s)]
*  we grew up playing, being coached by him, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=88.84s)]
*  even when he was not officially our coach. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=92.0s)]
*  There was a lot of hard work, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  a lot of spankings, yellings. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  But that was the way we grew up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=109.04s)]
*  My dad, like I said, he was coaching high school football [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=113.56s)]
*  since I was a little kid. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=116.08s)]
*  So when you screwed up, he didn't make excuses for you? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  He never felt sorry for me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=119.92s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=121.36s)]
*  I was probably treated the worst on the whole team. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Strangely, I got that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=131.56s)]
*  I didn't particularly like it, but I got it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=133.16s)]
*  The things that he said to me, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=139.0s)]
*  and I think sometimes, don't get me wrong, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=140.64s)]
*  and I think I told you the story last night, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=143.84s)]
*  had he and I been riding back from a practice home [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  one evening, and my dad's driving around here [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=150.76s)]
*  and we had a little small pickup truck, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=153.6s)]
*  and had he looked over to me and said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=157.12s)]
*  son, how you doing in school? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=159.2s)]
*  Everything, you in Deanna, okay? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  I would have thought that he had lost his mind. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=166.72s)]
*  That was just not his nature. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=169.48s)]
*  When I did, and another example, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=171.76s)]
*  so while I'm in Green Bay, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=175.72s)]
*  especially three or four years in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  when I really was playing exceptionally well, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=180.76s)]
*  he would come to games, and after the game, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=185.44s)]
*  he'd ride to the game with me in my truck, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  and he would ride back home after the game [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  with me in my truck, and he would critique the way I played. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=192.72s)]
*  Now, my dad was, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=196.0s)]
*  he was not really a technician [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=199.88s)]
*  from a coach's perspective. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=204.2s)]
*  It was more just work hard, be tough, be a great teammate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=206.68s)]
*  That was kind of his three things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=212.04s)]
*  It wasn't like, all right, we're gonna scheme him to death. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=214.48s)]
*  He was not a schemer. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=218.24s)]
*  We ran the football, and I'm going way back [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=221.96s)]
*  to where the younger generation doesn't even know [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=224.92s)]
*  what the wishbone is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=226.55999999999997s)]
*  Wishbone was prolific back when Barry Switzer and Osborne [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=228.76s)]
*  were doing it back in those days. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=234.04s)]
*  For those who don't know, what is the wishbone? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=234.88s)]
*  It's a quarterback's under center. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=236.92s)]
*  You have a fullback, you have a halfback and a halfback, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  and you run misdirection options. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  I would say if you had 70 plays in a game, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  68 of them are runs. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=249.04s)]
*  Some type of veer option, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't even know how to explain it, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=255.08s)]
*  but that's what we ran. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=256.96s)]
*  I say that because when my dad would critique me, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=262.2s)]
*  for example, maybe I was 28 for 32 in the game, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=266.0s)]
*  which is great. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=269.12s)]
*  300 yards, two touchdowns, maybe an interception, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=270.92s)]
*  maybe no interceptions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=275.0s)]
*  Dad would give me a truck, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=276.6s)]
*  and rather than say, well, I'm proud of you, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=278.88s)]
*  you did really a good job. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=280.84s)]
*  He would say, you know, you could have completed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  those other four passes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  And I would say, dad, don't even think about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  trying to critique me for a man who wouldn't throw a pass [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  or allow his son to throw a pass. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=296.96s)]
*  You're gonna tell me how I should throw [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=298.52s)]
*  or what I should have done better? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=301.24s)]
*  And he'd get all bent out of shape. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=304.28s)]
*  But I thought I had a fair argument. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=306.16s)]
*  I'd say that- [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=311.04s)]
*  So you had to be able to take criticism. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=311.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  Certainly from him is where it started. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=315.92s)]
*  So like, I've had some great coaches after him, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=318.24s)]
*  and the really good coaches [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=322.88s)]
*  will get on your ass a little bit, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=327.12s)]
*  no matter who you are. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=329.6s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=331.68s)]
*  Did I particularly like it? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=332.68s)]
*  No, but I understood that that was part of the process [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=334.04s)]
*  and needed to be done. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  And I've even had coaches say, look, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=338.8s)]
*  now I'm gonna chew your ass a little bit, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=340.72s)]
*  but I want the other guys to know [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=343.12s)]
*  that you're no different than anybody else on the team. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=345.8s)]
*  And I'm all in on that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=351.68s)]
*  But that started with my dad. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=353.56s)]
*  You told me a story last night about being a kid [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=355.44s)]
*  riding your bike with your brother. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=357.24s)]
*  Would you mind repeating that story? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  So my wife loves this story. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=362.44s)]
*  So me and my brother, my older brother, Scott, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=367.12s)]
*  were two years apart. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=369.12s)]
*  I'm guessing we were probably, he was 12, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=371.12s)]
*  say I'm nine or 10. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=373.84s)]
*  So we lived on a half a mile dirt road, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=376.4s)]
*  one way in, one way out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=379.4s)]
*  No neighbors anywhere remotely close, several miles away. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=380.92s)]
*  So for whatever reason, we didn't ride bikes a lot, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=386.76s)]
*  but this one particular day, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=389.24s)]
*  we were riding down a gravel road. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=390.6s)]
*  And I got my, if your road bites as a kid, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=393.2s)]
*  you probably got your pants leg caught in a chain [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=396.6s)]
*  at some point. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=398.36s)]
*  So I got my pants leg caught in a chain [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=399.72s)]
*  and it kind of wrapped up pretty good. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=401.56s)]
*  And so we're trying to get it out, me and my brother Scott. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=403.08s)]
*  So my dad comes driving down the road from home, going out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=406.8s)]
*  You could hear the truck coming, you see the dust, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=411.72s)]
*  and he stops. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=415.48s)]
*  And I was telling him, telling you the truth. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=416.56s)]
*  The passenger window, there was no passenger window [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  and the door was held shut or somewhat shut [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=423.12s)]
*  with an extension cord. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=426.0s)]
*  So he pulls up, he looks out the window [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=429.04s)]
*  and he says, what are y'all doing? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  So riding bikes, my pants leg got caught in a chain. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=436.12s)]
*  Will you help me get it out? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=439.6s)]
*  Oh hell, I ain't got time for that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=440.88s)]
*  So he takes off. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=443.2s)]
*  He gets about 50 to 100 yards down the road [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=446.08s)]
*  and I do that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=448.56s)]
*  And all of a sudden brake lights, you see the brake lights [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  and you see the truck stopping, gravels flying, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=454.88s)]
*  and he hits it in reverse and starts coming back. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=458.12s)]
*  And my brother Scott says, you better run. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, keep in mind, I got my pants leg caught in a chain [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=465.08s)]
*  and I'm not running anywhere. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=467.5s)]
*  So I'm trying to hop into the woods. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=468.68s)]
*  Needless to say, it was the last time I flipped anyone off [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=470.76s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is the God's honest truth. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=475.56s)]
*  I told my dad that I only did that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=477.4s)]
*  because I saw people do it when they were mad [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=480.96s)]
*  at other people. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=484.52s)]
*  He didn't buy it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=486.56s)]
*  Like you didn't even know what it meant. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  I didn't know what it meant. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  I just knew that people did it when they were pissed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=490.08s)]
*  So it was quite a bit longer before I ever did that again. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=493.52s)]
*  But that was, yeah, that was my dad. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  He was, again, if he would have, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=500.08s)]
*  it was very little compassion. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  And if my dad would have said to me, son, I love you, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=507.8s)]
*  I would have thought, dad, are you okay? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=511.44000000000005s)]
*  You got fever? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=513.4s)]
*  But I knew he loved me in his weird sort of way. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=514.96s)]
*  When he died famously, suddenly, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  you played one of the best games of your life the next day. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=523.08s)]
*  I would say it was the best game. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  Statistically speaking, I don't think anyone can argue, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=529.12s)]
*  just first half long. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=532.1s)]
*  You know, when I left the game after 20 years, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=534.34s)]
*  and I don't say this braggingly, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=538.94s)]
*  I had every passing record, good and bad, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  that you could possibly own, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=545.22s)]
*  now since they've all been passed. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=546.62s)]
*  But I say that only because only once in my career, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=548.98s)]
*  I think once, maybe twice, did I throw for 400 yards ever. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=553.74s)]
*  Now guys do that all the time. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=558.98s)]
*  Now at one time I had the yardage passing record, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=560.86s)]
*  but it wasn't because I was throwing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=564.14s)]
*  for four and 500 yards a game. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=568.02s)]
*  At halftime of this game, I had 399 yards. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=569.94s)]
*  Guys do it all the time now. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=575.78s)]
*  But for me, in the way I played, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=577.1s)]
*  that was nothing short of a miracle. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=579.74s)]
*  And four touchdowns at the end of the first half. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=583.5s)]
*  So I could have ended the game right there [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=586.14s)]
*  with better statistics than I'd had [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=588.54s)]
*  in any other full game in my career. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=590.8199999999999s)]
*  The day after your father died? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=593.26s)]
*  The day after. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=594.3399999999999s)]
*  How'd you do that? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=595.62s)]
*  Well, it was the hardest thing that I ever had to do. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=597.5s)]
*  There was a lot of talk prior to the game [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=601.98s)]
*  on whether or not I would play, speculation. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=604.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the hotel in Oakland, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=609.18s)]
*  I knew I was gonna play, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=612.02s)]
*  because that's what my dad would have wanted me to do. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=613.6999999999999s)]
*  And the people who knew my dad [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=615.7s)]
*  and the way that he carried himself all understood. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=619.0600000000001s)]
*  You better play in that game. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=624.1s)]
*  I mean, I could just hear him, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=625.7s)]
*  don't you sit out for this. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=627.7s)]
*  The hard part to me was not playing in the game, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=630.34s)]
*  but playing well enough to honor my father in my mind. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=634.0200000000001s)]
*  And that was exceptionally hard, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=639.94s)]
*  because it was hard to focus on the job at hand. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=641.86s)]
*  It was the second to the last regular season game. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=646.66s)]
*  We had to win the game [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  to continue our playoff possibilities. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=650.54s)]
*  We had to win that game and quite frankly, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=655.26s)]
*  win the next game and hope for a loss [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=657.1s)]
*  by another team to get in. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=659.14s)]
*  So we needed to win. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=660.9399999999999s)]
*  And I knew that my teammates were counting on me, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=662.5s)]
*  but I kind of lost track of the game plan for obvious reasons. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=666.66s)]
*  There was a lot going on, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=672.58s)]
*  and the least of which was scheming and game plan issues. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=674.9000000000001s)]
*  So the pressure to perform that I had placed upon myself [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=679.7s)]
*  was like, and I played in two Super Bowls, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=685.0200000000001s)]
*  played in Pro Bowls, played in a lot of big games, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=687.5400000000001s)]
*  but the pressure to perform at the level [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=689.9000000000001s)]
*  that I ended up performing at was almost unreachable, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  but yet it happens. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbU_m1WZMck&t=698.38s)]
