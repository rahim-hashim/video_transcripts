# Tucker: Our leaders stand in the way of fixing this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there was a horrifying, we're sad to tell you, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=2.7s)]
*  a horrifying amount of violence in the United States [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=5.48s)]
*  over the weekend as increasingly there is. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=7.28s)]
*  Over just two days, at least 104 Americans were shot [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=9.8s)]
*  to death in major American cities. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=12.96s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=14.46s)]
*  How many? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=15.68s)]
*  Well, for perspective, on the single deadliest day [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=16.52s)]
*  of the Iraq war, that would be January of 2005, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=18.18s)]
*  a total of 37 Americans died. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  So what's happening in our cities right now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=24.44s)]
*  looks a lot like a war, even if we rarely acknowledge it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Dallas, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=29.2s)]
*  many other metro areas recorded murders over the weekend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=31.72s)]
*  That's typical now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=34.64s)]
*  In St. Louis, 13 people were shot, five of them fatally. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=35.9s)]
*  In Chicago, 33 were gunned down, five of those died. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  In Laguna Woods, California, a Chinese immigrant [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=43.54s)]
*  from Las Vegas walked into a Presbyterian church [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=45.72s)]
*  and shot six elderly Taiwanese parishioners. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Police say he was motivated by some kind of political [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=51.32s)]
*  and ethnic hatred. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=53.72s)]
*  And of course, most famously of all, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=55.6s)]
*  on Saturday afternoon, a teenager [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=57.2s)]
*  in a mock military uniform walked into a grocery store [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=58.84s)]
*  in Buffalo and shot more than a dozen strangers [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  with a rifle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  No doubt you've seen accounts of this on the news. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=65.44s)]
*  What you probably haven't seen are details [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=68.4s)]
*  about any of the 10 Americans who were murdered [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=70.16s)]
*  in that store in Buffalo. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=72.48s)]
*  You may not even know their names, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=73.78s)]
*  much less who they were or who they loved. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=75.04s)]
*  Most of them were black, we know that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=77.56s)]
*  But beyond the way they look, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  not a lot has been reported about them [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=81.22s)]
*  because the coverage hasn't been about them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=83.88s)]
*  Nor in fact has it really been about the gunman. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=86.6s)]
*  He was an 18-year-old called Peyton Gendron. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=88.88s)]
*  Gendron was mentally ill. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=91.72s)]
*  Everyone around him knew that, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  including his teachers and the local police. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Less than a year ago, Gendron was committed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  to a mental hospital after threatening to murder [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=99.0s)]
*  his classmates at a school graduation ceremony. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=101.1s)]
*  So on Saturday, after he made good [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  on his longstanding threat to open fire into a crowd, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=106.24s)]
*  Gendron left an 180-page letter that he said [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  would explain his motives. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=112.41999999999999s)]
*  You've probably heard this document described [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  as a racist manifesto, but that's not quite right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=115.96s)]
*  It's definitely racist, bitterly so. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=119.82s)]
*  Gendron reduces people to their skin color. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=122.44s)]
*  That's the essence of racism and it's immoral. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  But what he wrote does not add up to a manifesto. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  It is not a blueprint for a new extremist political movement, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=130.24s)]
*  much less the potential inspiration for a racist revolution. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=133.16s)]
*  Anyone who claims that it is, is lying or hasn't read it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=136.64s)]
*  Instead, Gendron's letter is a rambling pastiche [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=140.72s)]
*  of slogans and internet memes, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=143.56s)]
*  some of which flatly contradict one another. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=145.36s)]
*  The document is not recognizably left-wing or right-wing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=148.0s)]
*  It's not really political at all. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=151.12s)]
*  The document is crazy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=153.06s)]
*  It's the product of a diseased and organized mind. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=154.8s)]
*  At one point, Gendron suggests that Fox News [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  is part of some global conspiracy against him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  He writes like the mental patient he is, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  disjointed, irrational, paranoid. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=165.0s)]
*  Now that's true, not that it makes the atrocities [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=168.08s)]
*  he committed easier to bear. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=170.24s)]
*  If your daughter was murdered on Saturday in Buffalo, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  you wouldn't care why the killer did it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=174.1s)]
*  or who he voted for. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  But the truth about Peyton Gendron does tell you a lot [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  about the ruthlessness and dishonesty [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=180.94s)]
*  of our political leadership. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=183.22s)]
*  Within minutes of Saturday's shooting, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  before all of the bodies of those 10 murdered Americans [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=186.94s)]
*  had even been identified by their loved ones, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=189.26s)]
*  professional Democrats had begun a coordinated campaign [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=191.98s)]
*  to blame those murders on their political opponents. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=194.7s)]
*  "'They did it,' they said immediately. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=197.62s)]
*  "'Patron Gendron was the heir to Donald Trump,' [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=200.18s)]
*  they told us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=202.78s)]
*  Trumpism committed mass murder in Buffalo. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  And for that reason, it followed logically, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=206.94s)]
*  we must suspend the First Amendment.'" [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=209.3s)]
*  That's hardly an exaggeration of what they're saying. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=212.26s)]
*  Here's a selection from yesterday's Sunday shows. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=214.9s)]
*  Social media companies and law enforcement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=218.02s)]
*  have not done enough to monitor, to ban, to restrict, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=222.06s)]
*  and to limit hate speech on their sites. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=228.62s)]
*  Hate speech is not freedom of speech. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=232.94s)]
*  As you know, the First Amendment does not protect hate speech. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=235.62s)]
*  I'll protect the First Amendment any day of the week, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=240.38s)]
*  but you don't protect hate speech. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=243.02s)]
*  You don't protect incendiary speech. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  You're not allowed to scream fire in a crowded theater. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=247.62s)]
*  There are limitations on speech, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=250.3s)]
*  and right now we have seen this run rampant. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=252.06s)]
*  So what is hate speech? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=255.94s)]
*  Well, it's speech that our leaders hate. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=257.14s)]
*  So because a mentally ill teenager murdered strangers, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=259.58s)]
*  you cannot be allowed to express [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=262.38s)]
*  your political views out loud. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  That's what they're telling you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=266.5s)]
*  That's what they've wanted to tell you for a long time, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=267.5s)]
*  but Saturday's massacre gives them a pretext [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  to justification. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=272.94s)]
*  You have to ask yourself, who behaves like that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=275.38s)]
*  What sort of person uses mass murder [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  as an excuse to give a campaign speech [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=280.73999999999995s)]
*  or seize more political power? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=283.05999999999995s)]
*  We'll find out tomorrow when Joe Biden travels [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  to the scene of this atrocity in Buffalo [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=287.38s)]
*  to speak to the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  We haven't seen an advanced copy of his remarks, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=290.78s)]
*  but we can guess what we will hear. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  Biden's approval rating appears to be the lowest [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=295.14s)]
*  ever recorded for a president this century, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=297.26s)]
*  lower than Donald Trump's. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  That is a disaster for his party. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=300.94s)]
*  The Democratic party will suffer for this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=302.61999999999995s)]
*  in this fall's elections. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=304.61999999999995s)]
*  Biden still has time to change course and fix it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=306.46s)]
*  He could try to improve the lives of voters [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  who are dissatisfied with him. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=310.58s)]
*  That is entirely possible. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=311.73999999999995s)]
*  That's what politicians typically do when they're down. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=313.17999999999995s)]
*  They listen to the people who might reelect them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=315.46s)]
*  But Biden doesn't plan to do that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  And we know for a fact because Politico disreported it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=320.06s)]
*  Instead, Biden has decided to attack people who disapprove. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  According to Politico, quote, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  Biden has taken to telling his aides [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  that he no longer recognizes the GOP, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=329.29999999999995s)]
*  which he now views as an existential threat [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=331.74s)]
*  to the nation's democracy, end quote. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=334.7s)]
*  People who disagree with Joe Biden, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=338.82s)]
*  according to Joe Biden, are now a quote, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=340.58s)]
*  existential threat to the nation, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=342.38s)]
*  like Al-Qaeda or climate change. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=344.14s)]
*  A threat that by definition is so profound, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=346.34s)]
*  we must declare war upon it if we're to survive. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=348.58s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, this threat that Biden is referring to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  is you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=355.78s)]
*  He's talking about his fellow Americans. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=356.9s)]
*  No president has ever spoken like this, ever. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=359.34s)]
*  Joe Biden does it regularly, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=362.3s)]
*  and he's certain to do it again tomorrow. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  But most painful and destructive at all, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=366.02s)]
*  Biden is likely to use racial wounds [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=367.74s)]
*  in order to make his point. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  There is no behavior worse than this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=372.78s)]
*  All race politics is bad, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=376.06s)]
*  no matter what flavor those politics happen to be. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=377.54s)]
*  No race politics is better than any other. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=380.5s)]
*  All of it is poison. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=383.74s)]
*  Race politics subsumes the individual into the group. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  It erases people, it dehumanizes them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=389.54s)]
*  Race politics elevates appearance over initiative [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=392.66s)]
*  and decency and all the other God-given qualities [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=395.18s)]
*  that makes every person of every color unique, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=397.94s)]
*  yet morally equal to every other person. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  And above all, race politics always makes us [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=404.3s)]
*  hate each other and always in a very predictable way. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=407.46s)]
*  So let's say you were to make identity politics mandatory [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=411.34s)]
*  in your country as they have. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=414.5s)]
*  How could you be surprised when that leads [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=416.34s)]
*  as it inevitably will to white identity politics? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=418.46s)]
*  Well, you could not be surprised. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=422.18s)]
*  You did it, and it was always going to happen. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=423.74s)]
*  And then what happens next? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=427.38s)]
*  Nothing good. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  Race politics is a sin. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=430.14s)]
*  Race politics always leads to violence and death. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  They learned that lesson in Rwanda in 1994. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=434.74s)]
*  Identity politics ended in genocide in Rwanda [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=438.42s)]
*  that killed 800,000 people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=440.18s)]
*  And in response to those horrors, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=442.74s)]
*  the Rwandans did something that we might learn from. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=444.06s)]
*  They moved in the opposite direction from the one [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=446.38s)]
*  that Joe Biden is currently taking in the United States. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  Ethnicity has already been stripped out of schoolbooks [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=451.66s)]
*  and rubbed off government identity cards, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=454.14s)]
*  reported the New York Times. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  Government documents no longer mention who to or tootsie [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=457.82s)]
*  and the country's newspapers and radio stations [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=461.14s)]
*  steer clear of the labels as well. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=463.14s)]
*  Most dramatic is how Rwanda's 8 million people [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=465.14000000000004s)]
*  now shun the identifications, the racial identifications [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=467.86s)]
*  that seemed to loom so large 10 years ago [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=471.54s)]
*  as Hutu extremists began their mass killings, end quote. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=474.58000000000004s)]
*  They have de-emphasized race in Rwanda, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  intentionally and systematically. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=481.18s)]
*  Rwandan citizens are citizens first, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=483.62s)]
*  members of racial or tribal groups second or not at all. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=485.98s)]
*  Result? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  There have been no more genocides in Rwanda, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=490.86s)]
*  and that could easily be the path forward [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=493.1s)]
*  for this country too. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=495.54s)]
*  There was only one answer to rising racial tension [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=496.66s)]
*  and that's to deescalate and do what we have done [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  and tried to do for hundreds of years, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  which is work toward colorblind meritocracy [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=504.02000000000004s)]
*  and treat people as human beings created by God [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=506.5s)]
*  rather than as faceless members of interest groups [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=509.18s)]
*  that might benefit some political party or other. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=511.46000000000004s)]
*  We have a moral duty to do this [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=514.26s)]
*  because all people have equal moral value [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=515.58s)]
*  no matter what they look like. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=518.1s)]
*  All lives matter, period. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=519.38s)]
*  That's not the determination of the US government, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  that's the determination of God and it's true. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=523.6999999999999s)]
*  And most Americans already believe it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=526.14s)]
*  They would like to see a return to the American way of life [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=528.5s)]
*  and the American way of life is meritocracy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=532.02s)]
*  Judge me by what I do, not by how I look, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=535.02s)]
*  by the content of my character, not the color of my skin. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=537.86s)]
*  We have a monument on the mall to this. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=541.1s)]
*  And yet suddenly every voice in power [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  is leading us in the opposite direction. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=546.98s)]
*  And what's the terminus of that journey? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=549.94s)]
*  It's destruction. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=551.7800000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows this. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=554.1s)]
*  Only our leaders stand in the way of fixing a problem [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=555.5s)]
*  that is growing worse by the day. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOab0eMgyJE&t=559.1400000000001s)]
