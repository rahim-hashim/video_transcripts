# Politicians know when they control the food, they control the people: Activist
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M)
*  Eva Vardingerbroek lives in the Netherlands, which has long been Europe's biggest food [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=0.0s)]
*  producer now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=6.12s)]
*  It's the global center of the bug food industry. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=7.44s)]
*  She joins us tonight for an update on what it's like to subsist on crickets. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=11.56s)]
*  Eva, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  So your country, the Netherlands, is famous for its agricultural output. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=17.84s)]
*  Now it's famous for insects. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  This feels like the leading edge of a global trend. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=26.34s)]
*  Do you think that it is? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=28.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=30.14s)]
*  There's no surprise there. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=31.14s)]
*  My country really is, sadly, the pilot country for an organization like the World Economic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=32.7s)]
*  Forum. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=37.22s)]
*  We are sort of the tester kid of the 2030 agenda. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=38.22s)]
*  So the fact that we, the second largest exporter of agricultural products in the world, our [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=41.82s)]
*  nation with such a rich farming history, is now cracking down on its farms and opening [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  insect factories should be of no surprise to you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=52.7s)]
*  This is not something that is just going to affect the food supply of the Netherlands. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=56.9s)]
*  Like I said, we're the second largest exporter of agricultural products in the world after [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=60.4s)]
*  America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  So this will influence the food supply worldwide. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  And we've spoken to farmers who said, well, this could lead to actual starvation if we're [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=68.58s)]
*  not careful. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=72.58s)]
*  I have to ask about the role of the population in this, since purportedly the Netherlands, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=75.58s)]
*  like the United States, is a democracy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=80.1s)]
*  Do the people of the Netherlands want to eat bugs? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=82.82s)]
*  Is this happening because there was a popular outcry, bring us more bugs? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=85.46s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=89.3s)]
*  Nobody's being asked. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  And I think that that's the point, you know, nobody really inherently wants to eat bugs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  When we think about bugs, we, you know, curly things, you know, nobody wants to eat that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=97.28s)]
*  But they're telling us that it's good for the climate, that this is the way that we [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  can save the planet and that that little steak that you have on your plate that gives you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=105.5s)]
*  some joy in life is what actually ruins the world. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=109.38s)]
*  And of course, none of that is true. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=113.02s)]
*  I think that the push for insect eating is just a compliance test, because our politicians [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=114.38s)]
*  know that when they control the food, they control the people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  I mean, why not earthworms and rats, as long as you're humiliating people on purpose by [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=123.14s)]
*  making them eat repulsive things? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=131.94s)]
*  Well, I think that that's the whole point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=132.94s)]
*  So, you know, don't give them any ideas, Tucker. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=134.74s)]
*  I think the rats and the mice and all of that are next on the menu after the crickets that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=136.82s)]
*  they now are trying to put in our food. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=141.66s)]
*  So my last question is, what has the pushback been like? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  A country with a thousand year history of growing food has got to be resistant to this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=148.26s)]
*  Have people made that clear, that resistance? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=155.14s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=157.78s)]
*  We've had massive protests. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=159.34s)]
*  So our farmers protests that you and I have been speaking about plenty of times now and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=160.82s)]
*  that also have been featured in this documentary, they've been very successful. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=164.3s)]
*  So we actually had elections just now in the Netherlands where a lot of people, actually [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=168.46s)]
*  the largest party was the farmers party. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=172.78s)]
*  So the Dutch people don't want to be eating insects. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=175.86s)]
*  We understand that a traditional profession such as farming that we have been good at [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=178.5s)]
*  for centuries on end is not the cause of a modern day so-called crisis such as climate [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=182.94s)]
*  change. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=188.9s)]
*  So no, the people know what they want. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=189.9s)]
*  We don't want to be eating insects. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=191.54s)]
*  We want our steak. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=193.4s)]
*  And as long as we, well, keep saying no to this insect push, we might still have a chance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=194.48s)]
*  of eating it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=199.48s)]
*  But I really do feel like now is the time to say no. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=200.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=204.76s)]
*  Farmers are not the problem. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=206.84s)]
*  Overpaid nonprofit executives and politicians are the problem, obviously. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  Eva Vlardengelbroek, thank you very much for joining us as always. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHzRnO8H0M&t=217.88s)]
