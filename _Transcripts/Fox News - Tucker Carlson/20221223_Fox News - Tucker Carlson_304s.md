# Woman arrested near British abortion center for praying speaks out
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY)
*  Here's an amazing story. Isabel von Spruce is the leader of 40 Days for Life campaign in Birmingham, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=0.0s)]
*  England. She's not a terrorist, she's the opposite, she's someone who prays a lot. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=5.76s)]
*  Well, earlier this month she was praying silently outside an abortion clinic in Birmingham. She [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=11.28s)]
*  wasn't yelling or carrying a sign or blocking a doorway or doing anything disruptive. She was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  just praying. Praying. Not to the government, to God. And that's not allowed anymore. So police [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=18.48s)]
*  approached her and arrested her and charged with violating a public space protection order and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  committing, quote, anti-social behavior. And we're not making this up. It was caught on video. Here it is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=29.36s)]
*  Isabel von Spruce joins us tonight. Isabel, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=59.36s)]
*  So the order is designed, the law is designed to protect public spaces from praying? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=83.92s)]
*  Well, maybe if I could give a bit of a background to this. So for 20 years or around that, I've been [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=93.92s)]
*  going outside abortion centers and praying there and offering help to women. I know well over 100 [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  women who've accepted our help and continued their pregnancies. But in September this year, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=106.08s)]
*  the local council in Birmingham brought in this censorship zone, this PSPO. Formerly these were [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=113.6s)]
*  used for dog frowning and drunken behavior and things like that. But they're now popping up [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=120.16s)]
*  around the country surrounding abortion centers and they ban behavior like protesting. But it also [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=124.72s)]
*  names prayer and counseling as forms of protesting. And so four times I went and stood near the closed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=133.84s)]
*  abortion center and silently prayed there. And as you can see, the police came and asked me if I was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=142.0s)]
*  protesting, which I wasn't. They asked me if I was praying. I said I might be silently praying. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=147.6s)]
*  I was arrested. I was searched. I was locked in a cell. I was then interviewed or interrogated, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=154.8s)]
*  however you'd like to see it, during which I was quizzed about what I was praying about. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=161.84s)]
*  I was then released on bail and then subsequently charged on four counts of protesting and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=167.76s)]
*  engaging in an act, intimidating of service users. So I now stand on trial on February the 2nd, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=175.44s)]
*  supported by ADF UK, really for freedom of thought. And the concern is here in England that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=183.2s)]
*  national buffer zones are now being discussed. So there's a possibility of every abortion center [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=192.32s)]
*  in this country having a similar zone around it. And obviously the implications of that are really [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=197.44s)]
*  concerning. If you're arresting people for praying, you are committing an act of evil. It's not a close [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=204.0s)]
*  call at all. There's sort of no debate about that. And I would think that even secular people would [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=211.04s)]
*  recognize that. Did anybody, any prominent person, step forward to defend you? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  I have had a lot of people who say they're pro-choice or that they support abortion, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=222.8s)]
*  but they've also got concerns about this. And that in itself is very encouraging to hear. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=230.0s)]
*  That it's not necessarily about people who support abortion or don't support abortion. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=236.24s)]
*  This is more to do with freedom of thought here. It's even gone further than freedom of prayer. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=240.56s)]
*  I mean, we all talk about the cancel culture and the concerns we have about people being canceled. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=245.84s)]
*  You know, speaking and public, maybe public speaking engagements. But to be arresting somebody [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=252.56s)]
*  for what they're thinking, it's just gone even a step further. It's actually quite surreal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=260.0s)]
*  That's the word I'd use to describe it. I mean, the amount of people who've used the word Orwellian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=264.88s)]
*  to me to describe this, likening it to the 1984 novel. And it's really seemed like that to me from [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=269.6s)]
*  start to finish. And I wish it's not over yet, but it's just quite a surreal experience. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=276.64s)]
*  Well, it's evil. It's an act of evil. Arresting someone for praying is an act of evil. Period. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=282.64s)]
*  And it just breaks your heart to think of all the people in charge, your prime minister on down, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=287.12s)]
*  who are standing by and allowing this to happen. And I'm just so glad that you did this. I hope [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=291.36s)]
*  you'll continue to do it. That's a human right. They can't take it away from you. And I appreciate [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=296.24s)]
*  your telling us about it on this show. Isabel Vance Bruce, thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Td5GHNQIgY&t=300.88s)]
