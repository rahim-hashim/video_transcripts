# Tucker’s epic reaction to Rachel Levine: ‘Beyond parody’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8)
*  I'm honored to serve as the first female four-star officer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=0.0s)]
*  of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=4.0s)]
*  Okay, so you're not a female. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=8.28s)]
*  You know, no one wants to attack you for that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=9.84s)]
*  It's totally fine, but when you get up on stage [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=11.82s)]
*  and say something that everyone knows is untrue [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=13.86s)]
*  and then demand that we believe it, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=16.02s)]
*  you degrade the rest of us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  It's outrageous, actually, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=19.78s)]
*  and not everyone wants to play along. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=21.44s)]
*  So this person is now an admiral. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=23.96s)]
*  To memorialize the moment, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=25.54s)]
*  the Babylon Bee named Rachel Levin their Man of the Year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=26.88s)]
*  It's a joke, but it's kinda true. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  In response to this, Twitter, on which no jokes are allowed, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=34.0s)]
*  suspended Babylon Bee for hate speech. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=37.3s)]
*  So per Twitter policy, when a man calls himself a woman, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=40.56s)]
*  you have to pretend that person is a man. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagQWQCQcU8&t=43.68s)]
