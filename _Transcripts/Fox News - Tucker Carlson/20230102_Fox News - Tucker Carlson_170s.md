# Lauree Simmons tells Tucker her shelter has raised $600K to help abandoned dogs at the border
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ)
*  Laurie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So I hope that what you're seeing [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=3.6s)]
*  in the response to that segment is a really deep love [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=7.4s)]
*  of animals, who are in some ways the weakest among us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=11.36s)]
*  We can do whatever we want to animals, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=14.24s)]
*  so it's a measure of our decency what we do to animals. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=15.74s)]
*  It's a measure of the fact that Americans still love animals. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=18.5s)]
*  Tucker, we cannot thank you enough for airing this story [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=24.44s)]
*  and it has helped us with your extremely generous [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=29.84s)]
*  dog-loving viewers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=34.74s)]
*  It is going to let us save so many more [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=37.5s)]
*  and also allow us to go back to the border. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=41.84s)]
*  We've currently got about 900 dogs [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=46.04s)]
*  between our Palm Beach County and Alabama facility, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  which all need medical care. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=54.36s)]
*  And this is starting off our new year in a great way, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=56.74s)]
*  and it's just really heartwarming to me [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=61.28s)]
*  to see how many people have reached out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=64.72s)]
*  to help donate and adopt. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=67.48s)]
*  And it's because of all of you that many dogs will be loved [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=70.36s)]
*  and have a chance at a wonderful new home. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=76.16s)]
*  I think it's meaningful that you're a no-kill shelter. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=80.02s)]
*  I mean, without judgment, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=82.72s)]
*  there are a lot of different kinds of shelters, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=83.56s)]
*  but I think people feel good about giving to a shelter [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=84.7s)]
*  that really is about dogs and about loving them [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=87.64s)]
*  and keeping them alive and not disposing of them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=90.78s)]
*  There are so many dogs still being surrendered [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=94.86s)]
*  because of inflation, the high cost of rent, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  fuel, groceries, everything, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  and shelters are so overcrowded right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=105.18s)]
*  So the need for rescue, the need for us to grow and save more [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=108.26s)]
*  is at an all-time high. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=113.62s)]
*  And we're just extremely grateful to all of you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  that join our cause, whether you donate, volunteer, adopt. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  And thank you so very, very much for getting this out [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=124.94s)]
*  because people need to know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=129.44s)]
*  there's wonderful dogs out there that need homes, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=131.62s)]
*  don't buy from a breeder, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=134.58s)]
*  spay and neuter your pets, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  let's end this problem of dog homelessness. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=138.26s)]
*  And the dogs need us and we're thankful for all of you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=141.96s)]
*  They love us unconditionally, we should love them back. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=151.72s)]
*  Laurie, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=152.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for what you're doing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=154.46s)]
*  And happy new year and thank you so much. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ijTYeglHQ&t=156.16s)]
