# Tucker: This Biden policy means many more young Americans will die
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w)
*  So the pictures you just saw are shocking. They're also real, so they can't be ignored. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=0.0s)]
*  In the coming days, you'll hear what's happening at the border described as a humanitarian crisis. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=5.28s)]
*  That means the migrants are suffering, and they definitely are suffering, and that's sad. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=10.0s)]
*  But what's sadder is that Americans are suffering too. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=13.44s)]
*  Open borders have caused a deadly crisis among the very people our governments supposedly exist [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=16.88s)]
*  to protect. Close to 100,000 Americans have died of drug overdoses in the last year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  These are not 85-year-olds with emphysema in nursing homes. These are kids on your street. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=28.8s)]
*  Young people in the prime of life, our country's future, the next generation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=33.84s)]
*  And they are dead now, mostly because of fentanyl that came up through Mexico. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  So open borders means much more of this poison in your neighborhood killing our children. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=42.56s)]
*  Statistics released this week show that as of the end of July, fentanyl seizures at the southern [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  border are more than double what they were for all of last year. Joe Biden did that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=54.64s)]
*  Open borders mean many more young Americans will die. Again, Joe Biden did that. Neither he nor [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  anyone around him cares, however. If 100,000 Afghan refugees died this year of anything, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  what would we be talking about? That and only that. CNN would do a special every week. What [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=73.36s)]
*  happened to the Afghan refugees? That would be the single biggest issue in this country by far. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  But 100,000 American young people? Joe Biden never even mentions it. He doesn't care. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=84.72s)]
*  And drugs are hardly the only disastrous effect of open borders. The median price of a new home [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  in this country is now almost six times higher than the median American household income. Think [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=97.44s)]
*  about that. That's a record. It's never happened. It's never been more expensive than it is now to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=102.56s)]
*  buy a house. If you're a young person who's hoping to start a life in this country, that is a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=107.44s)]
*  disaster. So why is it happening? Lots of reasons. Fed policy for one. But one of the reasons is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=112.56s)]
*  overcrowding. It's that simple supply and demand. No one ever mentions it, but since 1990, this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=118.4s)]
*  country has gained about 100 million people. 100 million. 1990. Doesn't seem like that long ago [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=124.0s)]
*  to some of us. Thanks to the lunatics now in charge, this unsustainable growth is accelerating [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=130.24s)]
*  in ways it never has before, ever. Under Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of immigrants are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=137.6s)]
*  coming into the United States every single month. So where are they going to live, exactly? Where [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=142.88s)]
*  are they going to send their children to school? What about the health care they've been promised [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  for free? Have you been to a hospital emergency room recently? You should go check it out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=151.6s)]
*  Once you see it, you'll understand the future the Democratic party is planning for you. Squalid, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=157.68s)]
*  overcrowded, chaotic, loud. Of course, having created this human disaster, Democrats now claim [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=161.6s)]
*  they have a solution to it. Of course, that's why they created it in the first place, so they could [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=167.68s)]
*  fix it. What's their solution? Amnesty for 8 million. That's what they proposed, and they may [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=170.48s)]
*  very well get it. Republicans are allowing this by and large. That amnesty, you should know, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=175.92s)]
*  would apparently extend even to violent criminals and gang members. But wait a second, you may be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=181.12s)]
*  asking, I'm an American, how is allowing MS-13 to choose my government to vote in my elections [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=185.44s)]
*  going to make my life better? What's in it for me? Well, here's Zoe Loughran of California to explain. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=192.32s)]
*  This amendment is very simple. It requires that aliens not receive amnesty if they are a gang [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=200.88s)]
*  member. I must oppose this amendment. As was mentioned before, the effect of the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=208.88s)]
*  amendment would really be to frustrate the legislative recommendations that are an investment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=220.0s)]
*  in human infrastructure. The United States will benefit from the resulting economic gains really [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=227.28s)]
*  for decades to come. This amendment would dilute that investment and diminish those economic [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=233.52s)]
*  benefits, and that alone is enough to oppose this amendment. Oh, the economic gains from inviting [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  millions more people who don't have high school diplomas into the country, nothing against those [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  people. But does any adult really foresee a future in this country where low skilled labor [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  is the engine of economic growth? That's insane. In fact, it's a lie shocking even by Washington [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=263.6s)]
*  standards. The Biden administration's plan will ultimately entitle illegal immigrants to the full [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  benefits of citizenship. That's the whole point. That would include Medicaid, Social Security, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=274.08s)]
*  food stamps, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Even as the welfare state expands, the number of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=278.48s)]
*  people drawing from it expands as well. How's that going to end? The cost of all of this, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=283.52s)]
*  according to the Congressional Budget Office, will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  in the next few years alone. What about long term? Some estimates put the cost at well over a trillion [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=292.24s)]
*  dollars or more, but that's all justified according to Zoloftgren because it's human [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=297.44s)]
*  infrastructure. Human infrastructure? That's weird. Humans are not infrastructure. Humans are alive. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=303.68s)]
*  They have souls. There's a difference between people and sewage systems, but not in the eyes [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=312.56s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. There's really not that much difference. They don't care about individuals. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=319.84s)]
*  Individuals are expendable. That's the mindset of every revolutionary through history. People are a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=325.36s)]
*  means to power. So to our leaders, illegal immigrants have a very specific functional [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=332.72s)]
*  purpose. They are a tool to change the country forever and ensure permanent Democratic control [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=339.6s)]
*  over our government. They look at the numbers. If you were born in this country and you don't have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  a high school degree, you're not voting for them. You don't like what they're doing. They don't want [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=350.72s)]
*  to change your mind. They can't be bothered. So they're going to bring in new people without [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  high school degrees. Got it? It's changing the country in order to win elections. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=359.44s)]
*  So if this passes, millions of people who came to this country illegally, who by definition don't [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=365.44s)]
*  care about our laws or law and order, that's why those people from January 6th are still in solitary [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=370.0s)]
*  confinement because they didn't believe in law and order. But the people who care so deeply about law [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=375.2s)]
*  and order are well-thinking millions who clearly don't buy our system because they're breaking our [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=379.84s)]
*  laws the day they get here. The only point of this is to make the Democratic Party more powerful. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=384.48s)]
*  That's why it's not simply Zoloftgren who's talking about human infrastructure. The Biden [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=392.64s)]
*  administration is talking about it too. So is Jerry Nadler. He chairs the House Judiciary Committee. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=397.2s)]
*  ...strikes the entire immigration title and the important investments in our human infrastructure [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=405.2s)]
*  that it makes. Therefore, I urge opposition to the amendment. Yes, if the chairman would [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=411.52s)]
*  if the chairman would indulge me, I'd like to know if he just used the term human infrastructure [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=419.36s)]
*  to refer to the portion of the bill that Mr. Gohmert seeks to strike with his amendment. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=426.72s)]
*  I did. So illegal immigration is now human infrastructure. I don't know what to say. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=432.48s)]
*  That was Congressman Thomas Massie and he's absolutely right. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=443.36s)]
*  And it's true and obvious to anyone who actually reads the amnesty bill. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=447.12s)]
*  Under the Biden administration's plan, several categories of illegal aliens will get green cards, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  meaning they'll be allowed to live in this country and eventually get full citizenship and be allowed [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=456.88s)]
*  to vote for Democrats. One of the groups that will receive green cards includes quote essential [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=461.04s)]
*  workers. This at a time when we've got an employment crisis. But what are essential workers exactly? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=466.24s)]
*  What turns out according to the Democrats in Congress, pretty much every worker is an essential [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=471.92s)]
*  worker. Illegal migrants working in agriculture, which is overwhelmingly mechanized now, by the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=476.4s)]
*  way, health care, food, construction, transportation are all included. They can stay here indefinitely. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=480.88s)]
*  So can illegal migrants that the Biden administration refers to as dreamers. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  That sounds like a relic from the Obama years. No, it includes any illegal immigrant who entered [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=491.2s)]
*  this country prior to this year under the age of 18. This is insane. Let's just say it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  To prove how insane it is, Congressman Mike Johnson of Louisiana tried to introduce an [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  amendment that would ban illegal migrants who have multiple DUIs from getting amnesty. Remember [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=506.16s)]
*  we used to be against drunk driving? Not anymore. That was rejected too. Let's make sure that if you [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  have a serial offender, someone who repeatedly is convicted of driving under the influence, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=518.64s)]
*  that at least that will prevent them from being given amnesty. I urge all my colleagues to at [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=525.28s)]
*  least support this amendment, and I yield back. Whether someone has two or six or ten or twenty [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=532.4s)]
*  convictions of DUI 30 years ago, someone can change. That's why we have the waiver provision. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=537.92s)]
*  You may have any number of convictions for DUI because you're a drunk, because you're an alcoholic, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  but you also may cease to be an alcoholic. And we all know people, or at least I know people, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=552.24s)]
*  I'm sure many of us know people, who are no longer alcoholics and ought to be able to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=558.96s)]
*  enjoy the benefits of the law. Yeah, so they suddenly have deep compassion for people [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  struggling with chemical dependence. That's why they shut down the country's AA meetings for the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=578.88s)]
*  last year. What do you think the effect of that was? That's why they completely ignored nearly [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=582.64s)]
*  100,000 Americans dead of drug ODs. They don't care at all. But do you hear the compassion [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=586.96s)]
*  in Jerry Nadler's voice? He's got real compassion for serial criminal offenders, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  as long as they're coming here illegally. He does not have compassion for you. So the minute that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  you break the law that Jerry Nadler and the Democratic Party would like to enforce, the ones [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=603.6s)]
*  where they tell you what you can do with your own body, what job you can have, what you can say in [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  public, then you're not human infrastructure. You're a criminal. Here's the Senate majority [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ycKkv2r3w&t=611.44s)]
