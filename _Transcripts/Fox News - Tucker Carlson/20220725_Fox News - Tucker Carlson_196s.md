# 'Band-Aid solutions' will not solve economic struggles of everyday Americans
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k)
*  So recession is not just a state of mind, it is a measurable condition into which an economy falls. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=0.0s)]
*  And here's how it has always been defined by economists. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=10.16s)]
*  Recession is two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=13.0s)]
*  In the first quarter of this year, GDP went down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  This week, second quarter GDP numbers will be released. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=19.96s)]
*  What will they tell us? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=23.0s)]
*  Well, here's a hint. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=24.72s)]
*  The White House just released a statement, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=26.36s)]
*  While some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling GDP constitute a recession, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=33.0s)]
*  Really? OK. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=39.2s)]
*  Well, we thought we would talk to someone who has seen a lot of business cycles, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  been in business. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=45.2s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy is executive chairman and co-founder of Strive Asset Management, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=45.96s)]
*  which is a fascinating new company. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=50.84s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=52.52s)]
*  Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  So you're in business. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=56.36s)]
*  What do you think of this new definition of a recession? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=59.04s)]
*  Look, it's like George Orwell, who said it best, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=62.88s)]
*  The best way to control a society is to control its language first. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=65.16s)]
*  And just like diversity is conformity, inclusion is exclusion, war is peace. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=69.28s)]
*  Now, apparently, a recession is something other than two consecutive quarters of GDP decline. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=74.44s)]
*  Now, the thing I'll tell you, Tucker, is most sophisticated investors in the market have already quietly accepted the fact [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=79.28s)]
*  that we are in a recession, regardless of what this administration says. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=84.48s)]
*  Investors pay attention to companies' earnings, just like at Walmart's disastrous report earlier today, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  where they slashed their profit expectations for the future. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=93.32s)]
*  So investors aren't really going to pay attention to what the administration says. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=96.32s)]
*  They know what's really going on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=98.84s)]
*  But the thing to pay attention to here is that it's not just the recession that matters. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=100.52s)]
*  We are also facing rampant 9 plus percent inflation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=105.44s)]
*  And in the market, you can either have recession without inflation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=109.72s)]
*  You could, in principle, have 9 plus percent inflation without a recession. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=112.84s)]
*  It's a double whammy for us right now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=116.48s)]
*  We're facing both. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=118.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, the people in charge of this administration are focusing on changing the language [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=119.6s)]
*  that tells you a bit about where their priorities are. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=123.8s)]
*  So the Walmart statement suggested, they said recession is the reason that their earnings will be short. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  But they suggested that maybe real recession is higher than 9 percent. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=131.12s)]
*  What do you think that the real, the actual experienced number is for people? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=135.04s)]
*  Well, I think if you look at who the everyday customer is at Walmart relative to a range of other businesses [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=139.48s)]
*  that may be more insulated by other forms of government subsidy or protection, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=145.2s)]
*  this is where the everyday American shops. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=149.12s)]
*  So I think that you have to look as a sophisticated market observer, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=151.64s)]
*  you've got to look at where the real harbingers are and where the real proxies are for the experience of the everyday American. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=155.52s)]
*  And I think that the real experience of inflation combined with inflation that's driven by actually high energy prices in this country [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=160.8s)]
*  suggests that actually the experience of most Americans is even worse than the numbers suggest. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  But this administration is just fixated on these band-aid solutions, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  like focusing on the language we use to describe it rather than addressing the problem. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=175.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=178.6s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, a man who is addressing problems. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=180.28s)]
*  We will see you again. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=182.6s)]
*  Appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=183.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9E9-ada17k&t=184.88s)]
