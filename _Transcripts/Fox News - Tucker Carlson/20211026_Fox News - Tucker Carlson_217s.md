# Tucker: Barack Obama is a 'heartless monster'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk)
*  A boy dressed as a girl is accused of raping an actual girl in the bathroom of a school in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=0.0s)]
*  Loudoun County, Virginia. That boy apparently has just been found guilty by a judge. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=4.88s)]
*  The father of the girl who says she was raped is called Scott Smith, and he said he plans to file [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=9.92s)]
*  a lawsuit against the school system over this, and that can't come too soon. At a recent school [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=14.64s)]
*  board meeting, the superintendent of Loudoun County Schools, a guy called Scott Ziegler, said, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=20.32s)]
*  We don't have any records of assaults occurring in our restrooms because, of course, they couldn't [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=25.36s)]
*  be bothered to keep track. What does that have to do with the equity agenda? Nothing. What do we care [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=29.6s)]
*  about our students? Nothing. So students walked out of school today in Loudoun County into protest. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=33.12s)]
*  Roseac is with The Daily Wire. He broke this story and deserves the credit for it. He joins us tonight [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  with an update. Luke, thanks so much for coming on. Everything about this story is stomach turning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=43.92s)]
*  Tell us where we are tonight, please. Well, yesterday, the kid was convicted in court of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=49.2s)]
*  both assaults, the first one that happened in a bathroom where he was convicted of rape, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=54.32s)]
*  and then the second one where the school didn't tell anyone that it happened, transferred him to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=60.24s)]
*  a different school, and he was arrested in October 6. So, you know, I broke that story on your show [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=64.08s)]
*  a couple weeks ago and in The Daily Wire, and most of the media largely ignored it because they said [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=68.8s)]
*  it was unsubstantiated. Two days ago, Barack Obama alluded to it while campaigning with [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=73.44s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe, calling it phony right-wing outrage. Yesterday, everything was substantiated [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=79.28s)]
*  in court, including bizarre detail that the fact that this kid was wearing a skirt is actually [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=86.08s)]
*  central to his defense. He claims that his wristwatch got caught on the skirt he was wearing while [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=91.2s)]
*  he was hanging out in the girl's bathroom, and that caused inadvertent sexual contact to occur. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=97.2s)]
*  So Barack Obama, who really is a heartless monster, and I'm glad that's clear to everyone now, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=104.32s)]
*  described the rape of a child as phony right-wing outrage? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=108.8s)]
*  This is what, you know, he's talking about parents being up in arms in Virginia and basically [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=115.92s)]
*  claiming it's all culture war stuff. First of all, I never really cared about the fact that this is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=120.64s)]
*  transgender. The bigger issue here is that school districts do not have the same priorities as [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=125.44s)]
*  parents, and that's really what Terry McAuliffe hit the nail on the head with, saying, you know, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=130.4s)]
*  he doesn't think parents should be telling schools what to teach. The head of the teachers [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  union said something similar this week. So the issue is, what's the appropriate role for parents [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=137.44s)]
*  in schools? And the Democrats seem to think they don't have one. These are our kids. We're going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=141.92s)]
*  to raise them in these government schools. The problem is, the main case study that they had for [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  this Parents Are Bad movement, it turned out to be a total hoax. I mean, this guy who was arrested, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=151.84s)]
*  and, you know, he looks like a blue collar guy. He's angry at school board meeting. They thought [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=156.88s)]
*  he was a bigot. Maybe he was opposed to masks. The clip that the media had the whole time with him, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=160.72s)]
*  you can hear his wife screaming at the end as her husband is hauled away in handcuffs, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=165.36s)]
*  my daughter was raped in school, and this is what happened. So no one asked this guy why he was mad. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=169.68s)]
*  We also found out this week that the White House worked with the National School Boards Association [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  to write the letter that called this guy another parent's domestic terrorist, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=180.56s)]
*  which the DOJ then used to justify FBI involvement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=184.0s)]
*  Yeah, so your daughter gets raped in a school bathroom. The school doesn't care or even keep [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=189.28000000000003s)]
*  track of the rape, and then you get denounced by the president and the DOJ as a domestic [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=192.88s)]
*  terrorist for complaining about it. It really does tell you everything, and we wouldn't know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=197.6s)]
*  this without your reporting. Luke Rosiak, thank you. Thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlqiChzcsk&t=200.64s)]
