# Tucker Carlson: Itâ€™s hard to understand this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8)
*  Evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot more than half of the entire population [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  of the entire state of Arizona lives in Maricopa County. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=4.92s)]
*  The cities of Mesa, Tempe, Scottsdale, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=9.16s)]
*  and largest of all, Phoenix, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=11.6s)]
*  are all within the county's borders. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=12.92s)]
*  If you want to win statewide in Arizona, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=15.36s)]
*  you have to win Maricopa County. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=17.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, as of tonight, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=20.16s)]
*  we still don't know who has won Maricopa County, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=21.12s)]
*  either in the US Senate race there [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=23.82s)]
*  or in the governor's race in Arizona, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=25.32s)]
*  because officials are not even close [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=27.46s)]
*  to finishing the count. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=29.12s)]
*  48 hours after the voting stopped, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  there are still 633,000 ballots still uncounted in Arizona. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  More than 400,000 of those are in Maricopa County. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=38.74s)]
*  You're seeing it on your screen right now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=41.6s)]
*  When will we know the results? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=43.84s)]
*  Last night, election officials claimed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=46.28s)]
*  they'd have a new tally for us by 8 p.m. Eastern, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=47.72s)]
*  the beginning of our show, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=49.84s)]
*  but the deadline came and went. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=51.3s)]
*  By the end of the night, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  they had finished counting fewer than 70,000 more votes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=53.94s)]
*  Then they said they'd have final totals [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=57.6s)]
*  by Friday tomorrow, but no. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=58.96s)]
*  Today, the county officials said [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=61.8s)]
*  they don't expect to announce the results of the elections [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=63.2s)]
*  until next week at the earliest. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=66.4s)]
*  When do you anticipate the votes will be counted [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=68.8s)]
*  in total, those 400,000 plus votes? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=72.86s)]
*  Well, we will be going into next week. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=75.56s)]
*  There's some onesie-twosies, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=78.9s)]
*  again, pursuant to Arizona law, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=80.8s)]
*  but I think that we'll see the lion's share here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=82.76s)]
*  wrap up by early next week. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=85.12s)]
*  Early next week, can you give me a day? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=88.12s)]
*  Are we talking Monday? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=90.12s)]
*  Maybe, as long as you won't hold me to it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us, Mr. Official, Mr. Election Official, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=97.0s)]
*  when we might learn who won the election? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=99.72s)]
*  Maybe, as long as you don't hold me to it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  That was the chairman of the Maricopa County Supervisors. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=105.84s)]
*  Notice what you did not hear in that exchange. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  You did not hear an apology. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=111.04s)]
*  The guy in charge of election results [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  never said sorry for not providing those results. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=114.96s)]
*  It's hard to understand this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=118.24s)]
*  It's not a resource problem, certainly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=119.6s)]
*  The budget of Maricopa County [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=121.72s)]
*  is about $4.5 billion a year. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=123.44s)]
*  For perspective, the entire Hoover Dam [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  cost $890 million to build, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=129.18s)]
*  and yes, that is in adjusted dollars. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=131.88s)]
*  So for the price of five Hoover Dams, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  Maricopa County can't even count the ballots [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=137.84s)]
*  in a single statewide election [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=140.28s)]
*  in a country that claims to care about democracy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  They can't even manage to let people vote on election day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=144.6s)]
*  On election day, according to the county, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=147.4s)]
*  70 of 223 polling places suffered major problems [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=149.8s)]
*  with voting machines, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=153.68s)]
*  machines the county paid millions for just recently. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=155.36s)]
*  And their failure disenfranchised mostly Republican voters [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=158.68s)]
*  who wanted to cast their ballots in person. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=161.56s)]
*  One poll worker reported that 25% of ballots [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=164.04s)]
*  were being rejected. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=166.72s)]
*  Now, you would call that third world, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=168.8s)]
*  but actually it's beneath third world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=170.44s)]
*  Most third world countries have serious elections. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=172.68s)]
*  They require voter ID. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=175.44s)]
*  They don't wait days for election results in Ghana, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=177.16s)]
*  in Venezuela, whatever you think of it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=180.18s)]
*  They tally their ballots within hours. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=182.12s)]
*  But suddenly we can't manage to do that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Clark County, Nevada, the home of Las Vegas, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=187.56s)]
*  says there are still tens of thousands [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=189.32s)]
*  of ballots left to count. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=190.88s)]
*  Therefore, we're not gonna know what happened [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=192.0s)]
*  in the election until Monday, we hope. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna talk to Adam Laxalt about that in a minute. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=197.24s)]
*  He's running for Senate there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=198.96s)]
*  Officials in Clark County are clearly overwhelmed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=200.8s)]
*  They're too busy to finish the one job they are paid to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  And yet strangely, they still have time [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=206.4s)]
*  to attack Donald Trump on social media, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=207.8s)]
*  which they've been doing all day, first things first. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just Nevada and Arizona. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  Key house races all along the west coast of the country, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  in California, Oregon, and Washington state, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  are still unsettled tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=220.08s)]
*  They're saying they haven't counted the votes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=221.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  What is this? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=225.52s)]
*  Is this fraud? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  We're not sure. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=228.08s)]
*  And on some level, it doesn't matter what it is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=229.32s)]
*  What we know is that the mechanics of our elections [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=231.76s)]
*  are not working, almost exclusively in states [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  and cities run by Democrats. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=236.32s)]
*  Are they cheating? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=238.94s)]
*  Are they disorganized? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  Again, not relevant. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=241.28s)]
*  The system is obviously out of control. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=243.56s)]
*  It's flaky. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=246.24s)]
*  And systems like that cannot be, by definition, reliable. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=247.44s)]
*  Would you let a Maricopa County elections official [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=251.68s)]
*  fly your aircraft? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=253.64s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=254.68s)]
*  That's a disaster. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=256.62s)]
*  Democracy is a faith-based system. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=257.8s)]
*  You have to believe in it in order for it to work. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  But who could believe in this? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=263.42s)]
*  So our news media, in case you haven't noticed, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=266.36s)]
*  has spent the last several years, quote, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=267.88s)]
*  defending democracy, insert trademark here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=269.2s)]
*  So you'd think that democracy defenders [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=272.16s)]
*  would care about the collapse of democracy, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=273.88s)]
*  but just the opposite. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=275.36s)]
*  They're telling you it's all completely normal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  It's always been this way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=278.48s)]
*  If you disagree, you'll be censored on social media, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=280.72s)]
*  as we found out today. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=282.56s)]
*  Twitter just slapped a warning label on videos [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=284.52s)]
*  from this show because we reported verifiable facts [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=286.76s)]
*  from election officials about election screw-ups. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's taking weeks to count the ballots in your democracy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=294.8s)]
*  but you're not allowed to notice it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=297.64s)]
*  What is this about? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Again, we're not sure. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=301.34s)]
*  And at this stage, there's really no way to know [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=303.08s)]
*  what it's about, so we're not making allegations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=305.0s)]
*  But we thought we'd ask, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=307.02s)]
*  because it'd be interesting to ask, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=308.4s)]
*  the most obvious question of all, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=309.76s)]
*  and see if we could find the answer. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=311.68s)]
*  And the question is, who's benefiting from this? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=312.76s)]
*  And how do you know? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=315.4s)]
*  We look backwards. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=317.6s)]
*  So in cases where there was chaos and delays [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=318.44s)]
*  in vote counting over the past several election cycles, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=320.92s)]
*  what percentage of the ultimate winners [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=323.8s)]
*  turned out to be Democrats? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=326.8s)]
*  Now, in a fair system, you would think the proportion [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  would land somewhere around 50%, a coin toss. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=331.56s)]
*  But we checked. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=334.88s)]
*  Oh, and that's not the case. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=335.92s)]
*  In 13 recent races we looked at [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=338.38s)]
*  where election delays were well publicized, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=340.56s)]
*  10 of them ultimately went to the Democrat. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=342.54s)]
*  10 out of 13, 77%. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=345.44s)]
*  That's not a coin toss. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=347.96s)]
*  That's a very high average. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=348.96s)]
*  Take for example, the 2018 election [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=350.92s)]
*  in Orange County, California. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=352.92s)]
*  Republican congressional candidates [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=354.48s)]
*  in three of the four Republican-held districts [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=355.92s)]
*  in Orange County had huge leads on election day. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=357.82s)]
*  But in the weeks following the election, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=361.04s)]
*  those leads disappeared. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=362.84s)]
*  They evaporated. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=364.36s)]
*  In the end, Democrats flipped each of those seats [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=365.6s)]
*  in Orange County, which not that long ago [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  was a very conservative area, and some places still is. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=369.52s)]
*  So how did that happen? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=372.88s)]
*  Well, the San Francisco Chronicle reported [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  that 250,000 vote-by-mail drop-off ballots came in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=376.12s)]
*  Many of those ballots were brought into polling stations [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=381.22s)]
*  by paid ballot harvesters. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=383.54s)]
*  The Orange County Register put it this way, quote, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=386.14s)]
*  "'People were carrying in stacks of 100 and 200 of them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=388.8s)]
*  We had multiple people calling to ask [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=392.2s)]
*  if these people were allowed to do this.' [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  But of course they were allowed. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  That was the point. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  These sudden reversals didn't just happen [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=400.18s)]
*  in Orange County, California. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=401.68s)]
*  In the state's 21st congressional district, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=403.52s)]
*  the Associated Press declared Republican David Villado [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  the winner because of his lead on election night. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=408.78s)]
*  And it takes a lot. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=411.32s)]
*  The AP does not call races for Republicans [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=412.28s)]
*  unless they're pretty sure. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  But in this case, they had to retract the call [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  nearly three weeks later after his opponent took the lead, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  the Democrat, because new ballots continued to be counted. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=421.34s)]
*  That same year, again in Nevada, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=425.64s)]
*  one local paper documented the lengthy problems [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=427.88s)]
*  in vote counting on election night, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=430.2s)]
*  and of course the inevitable result, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=431.68s)]
*  which you can guess by this point, and we're quoting. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=433.2s)]
*  "'After a long evening of tortuous delay [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  following a historic midterm election turnout, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=438.24s)]
*  the results were finally in, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=440.76s)]
*  and the blue wave promised by Nevada Democrats [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  became a definitive reality.'" [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=444.44s)]
*  It was the same story that year in places like Detroit, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=447.64s)]
*  and again, Arizona. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=449.64s)]
*  It took days for all the votes to be counted [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=451.5s)]
*  in the state of Arizona, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=453.56s)]
*  and ultimately, you will not be shocked to learn, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=454.48s)]
*  Republican Martha McSally narrowly rost [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=456.82s)]
*  for race for the Senate. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  So here you have lengthy delays in vote counting [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=460.76s)]
*  followed by good news for Democrats. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=463.56s)]
*  It's happened all over the country. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=467.16s)]
*  In 2020, it took officials six weeks to declare a winner [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  in the Democratic Party's congressional primary [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=471.6s)]
*  for two districts in the state of New York. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=473.72s)]
*  And in the end, because these were primaries, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=476.12s)]
*  it was an intra-Democratic Party contest, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=478.68s)]
*  the Democratic Party establishment, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=481.56s)]
*  the most powerful part of the Democratic Party, won. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  Longtime Congresswoman, Carol Maloney, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=487.0s)]
*  fended off an insurgent progressive successfully [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=489.2s)]
*  after long delays, and then Richie Torres [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=491.64s)]
*  defeated his challenger, who was a conservative Democrat. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=493.68s)]
*  Weird how that works. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=496.88s)]
*  Several years earlier, the same thing happened [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=498.72s)]
*  to Republicans in Sacramento. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=500.52s)]
*  On election night in 2014 in the suburbs of the city, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=502.44s)]
*  it looked like a Republican challenger called Doug Ose [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=506.2s)]
*  was about to unseat an incumbent [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=508.8s)]
*  Democratic congressman, Ami Bera. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=510.32s)]
*  The Republican was up more than 3,000 votes, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=513.2s)]
*  but then two weeks later, more votes came in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=515.44s)]
*  and guess what, the Democrat was declared the winner [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  by 700 votes, and he's been in Congress ever since. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=520.12s)]
*  In all the recent cases that we looked at, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=523.92s)]
*  only the state of Florida had a long voting count delay [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=527.24s)]
*  that led to a Republican winning, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=530.56s)]
*  and it was in just one county. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=532.48s)]
*  That was in the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=534.56s)]
*  when incompetent Democrats in Broward County broke the law [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=537.76s)]
*  and failed to report vote totals for days. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=541.0s)]
*  Ultimately, as you know, Ron DeSantis was elected [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  and as you know, Ron DeSantis won. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=547.04s)]
*  On Tuesday, thanks to efforts to improve vote counting [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=549.16s)]
*  in the state of Florida, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=551.64s)]
*  Florida tabulated results much more quickly. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  So Florida is far bigger than Arizona or Nevada, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=555.76s)]
*  but by contrast had its election results, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=558.88s)]
*  as you know, in a single day. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=561.48s)]
*  And by the way, Florida enforces voter ID law strictly. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's pretty hard to argue about who actually won. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=567.92s)]
*  So no matter what you think of Ron DeSantis or his policies, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=571.68s)]
*  you may hate him and them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=575.16s)]
*  You still, if you're an honest person, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  must acknowledge that that is a win for democracy. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=578.8s)]
*  The system worked. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=581.92s)]
*  The votes were counted. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=583.24s)]
*  They were reported promptly. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=584.52s)]
*  Democracy won in Florida, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=587.92s)]
*  even if the outcome is not to your preference. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=589.28s)]
*  But no one in the media seemed impressed by this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=592.0s)]
*  Here in fact is a CNN contributor arguing [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=594.4399999999999s)]
*  that by trying to prevent voter fraud, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=596.6s)]
*  Ron DeSantis actually, quote, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=599.0s)]
*  gamed the system. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=600.68s)]
*  Yesterday, he won by 20 percentage points. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=602.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  Because he gamed the system, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=606.8s)]
*  because he turned Florida into an unlevel playing field. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  They changed election laws, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=611.88s)]
*  making it harder to vote by mail. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=613.56s)]
*  They paraded a bunch of people, black people, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=615.4s)]
*  that they arrested for voting fraud [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=618.56s)]
*  and paraded them in front of national media. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  He created an election police. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=624.04s)]
*  He also was very good in responding to hurricanes [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=626.12s)]
*  and other tragedies. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=630.4s)]
*  So by fighting election fraud, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=633.04s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, quote, gamed the system. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=637.0s)]
*  Well, he certainly did. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  He gamed their system. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  And we ought to demand [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv1QK7sb9W8&t=643.04s)]
