# California teachers recruit students to gay club behind parents' backs
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I)
*  California Teachers Association is one of the most powerful unions in the country, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=0.0s)]
*  it is purely an organ of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Recently, the union held a conference to discuss how to indoctrinate school children without [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=8.16s)]
*  their parents' knowledge. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=13.52s)]
*  One first grade teacher called Blair Wyatt explained that it's best to hold meetings [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  for gender identity clubs during lunchtime so that parents never know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=18.72s)]
*  Yes, that lunchtime is kind of that sweet spot where the kids don't need to come earlier [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=23.2s)]
*  or stay late and kind of eliminates a little bit of that parent interaction if there are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=28.56s)]
*  kids who would like to attend but maybe their parents are unaware that they're interested [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=33.28s)]
*  in participating or unaware that they are out at school. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=39.92s)]
*  So if you can get it to happen at lunch, that seems like a really good structure to protect [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=42.72s)]
*  the kids' identities and protect and allow them to attend. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=49.04s)]
*  Amazing that they're admitting this in public. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=54.08s)]
*  DocuS from the conference also showed that teachers admit they read students' Google [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=56.64s)]
*  search histories looking for signs of interest in gender issues so they can take advantage [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=60.8s)]
*  of them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=67.52s)]
*  We wouldn't know any of this was happening if it weren't for Abigail Shrier. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=68.48s)]
*  She broke the story. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=71.12s)]
*  She's the author of Irreversible Damage, The Transgender Craze, and a very brave person. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=72.12s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=75.72s)]
*  Abigail, thanks so much for coming on for breaking this story. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=76.72s)]
*  It looks, on the face of it from what we just presented, that these teachers are intentionally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=80.28s)]
*  trying to hide what's going on from the parents of the kids. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=86.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=91.2s)]
*  The deception is actually the point. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=92.2s)]
*  It's explicit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=93.64s)]
*  And in fact, in both the reporting I did on that conference you mentioned in October and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=94.64s)]
*  then I've since seen more recent videos of the California Teachers Association specifically [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=99.8s)]
*  guiding teachers statewide in deception of parents about the clubs, about the membership, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=106.64s)]
*  even at the elementary school level, eight and nine-year-olds telling them to rename [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=113.0s)]
*  the clubs, things like Prism Club, so that the parents won't know what's going on in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  the club and won't be able to supervise. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  Since when are teachers allowed to get involved in these sex lives of minor children without [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  the knowledge of the parents? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=133.8s)]
*  That seems like a crime to me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=134.8s)]
*  Well, you know, in one of the videos I watched, put out by the California Teachers Association, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  the teachers instructed other educators that children as young as seven need support in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  their sexual identity and they believe it is their job to provide that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  And look, if this were a matter of parents coming in and saying their child had a particular [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=154.36s)]
*  sexual or gender identity and they wanted the school to support it, that would be one [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=163.08s)]
*  Instead, what the California Teachers Association is doing is they are deciding how to recruit [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=164.08s)]
*  students to these clubs, how to coach them in solidifying this gender identity or sexual [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=169.24s)]
*  orientation identity, and they're doing this by deceiving parents, specifically telling [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=177.44s)]
*  teachers how to keep the existence of the clubs and the membership from the parents. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=182.12s)]
*  I mean, I assume everyone's going to leave public schools at a certain point, who can [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=186.24s)]
*  at home school or whatever, this is too much. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  But in the meantime, is there anything that can be done to stop it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=192.28s)]
*  You know, I think that parents need to get really explicit with kids about things like [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=197.2s)]
*  gender and tell them what's being taught in schools is nonsense. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=203.28s)]
*  And in some cases, you know, if the parents are able to do it, they really should pull [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=208.28s)]
*  their kids out of these schools because this kind of nonsense spreads. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=211.4s)]
*  And the teachers, look, these are not, this is not members of LGBTQ doing this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=215.48s)]
*  I want to be really clear about that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=219.76s)]
*  These are activist teachers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  They are looking to peel the children away from the values of their homes and supplant [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  those values with their own. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=228.4s)]
*  They're grooming seven-year-olds and talking to seven-year-olds with their sex lives. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=230.0s)]
*  Like, we're the dads, by the way. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=234.12s)]
*  So many questions, so little time, but we are grateful to you for breaking this as you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=236.4s)]
*  have so many stories like it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=240.2s)]
*  Abigail Schreier, thank you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egA2kEaBw9I&t=241.32s)]
