# Tucker Carlson discusses American politics with British rapper Zuby
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg)
*  Well, September is Rap Star Month on this show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=0.0s)]
*  Apparently, last week we told you all about Nicki Minaj. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=2.64s)]
*  Tonight, an interview with Zuby, who is a rapper in the United Kingdom, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=5.2s)]
*  and a very insightful observer of American politics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=10.0s)]
*  Not at all afraid to say what he thinks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=14.32s)]
*  We sat down with him for a new episode of Tucker Carlson today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=17.2s)]
*  He told us what he thinks of the COVID mandates and the state of our ruling class. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  He's worth listening to. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=24.64s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=25.6s)]
*  When you're in London and you're in Great Britain, does anybody ever say, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=30.0s)]
*  I can't believe what's going on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=37.2s)]
*  Here you have Boris Johnson, smart guy, but can't manage his own life. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=38.72s)]
*  We don't know how many kids he has. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=42.96s)]
*  It's kind of a disaster personally telling us how to manage [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=44.4s)]
*  the intimate details of our lives. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=48.64s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=51.04s)]
*  Does anybody ever say that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=51.6s)]
*  Millions of people do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=53.04s)]
*  They do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=54.24s)]
*  Yeah, there are. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=54.56s)]
*  There is a resistance. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=55.6s)]
*  I don't want it to sound like every British person is a sheep [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  who's just willing to comply with whatever daddy government says. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=59.6s)]
*  It's not like that at all. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=62.32s)]
*  I think proportionally though, it's different. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=65.04s)]
*  And another thing with the USA, and again, a lot of Americans take this for granted, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=68.48s)]
*  a huge advantage of this country beyond its size and its geographical scale [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=73.28s)]
*  and its population is that you have states. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=77.28s)]
*  You have 50 different options within your own country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=81.36s)]
*  where you don't like the way things are going in California. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=85.68s)]
*  You've got 49 other options. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=88.88s)]
*  You don't like the way things are here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=90.08s)]
*  You can move without leaving your whole country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=92.24s)]
*  Whereas with lots of other countries, if things aren't going well, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  this is kind of the position I've found myself in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=99.6s)]
*  I love the UK. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the UK. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=103.36s)]
*  It's a wonderful country in many regards. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=104.72s)]
*  But I was just feeling like, man, I don't really like the way this is trending. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=107.28s)]
*  I have a lot of concerns with this direction and this response. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  And with me, it's like, well, there's nowhere else to go [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=117.12s)]
*  besides literally leaving the whole country, which is bittersweet. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=122.0s)]
*  It's an adventure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  But I don't like the fact that I felt like my hand was forced. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=128.32s)]
*  Things were going in such a direction where I was like, man, I don't know. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=134.56s)]
*  I talk to people who live in, all the freedom lovers who are out there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  in places like Australia right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a bad situation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=145.6s)]
*  I mean, you can't leave the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=146.88s)]
*  That in itself, it's one thing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=151.12s)]
*  You can't leave the country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=153.2s)]
*  You can't come in. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=155.52s)]
*  It's gone back to being a penal colony. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=157.44s)]
*  So why is it better than Cuba? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=160.8s)]
*  I mean, better beaches? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=162.4s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=164.64s)]
*  And it's also been revealed that a lot of people don't value liberty and freedom, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=165.28s)]
*  perhaps in the way that we thought that they did or people claimed to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=169.2s)]
*  I think now you're seeing that I've always had a suspicion that really people value [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=174.48s)]
*  safety and security or at least the illusion of it more than they value freedom and liberty. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  And that's really proven. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=183.76s)]
*  It's really, really proven to be the case. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, everything that's going on, every government overstep, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  every bit of authoritarianism or outright tyranny, what's the justification for it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, for the greater good, for your health, for your safety. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=193.6s)]
*  That's always the justification, even if they're clearly, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=197.27999999999997s)]
*  clearly going way, way, way beyond that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  But it's all from people who have no demonstrated record of success [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=203.44s)]
*  in the field that they're espousing on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden last week literally got up there and lectured American parents on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=210.8s)]
*  how to raise their kids. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=215.04s)]
*  Joe Biden, you know, whatever his good qualities, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=216.16s)]
*  has no right to lecture anyone on how to raise their children. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=219.76s)]
*  I mean, are you joking? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=223.2s)]
*  He should be ashamed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=224.32s)]
*  But it's true across the board. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=227.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=229.52s)]
*  Maybe part of the problem is we have just inept leaders. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=230.88s)]
*  Yeah. The thing is, it's also easy to advocate for things that don't affect you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=234.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=237.68s)]
*  There's been one of the biggest problems all throughout. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=238.64s)]
*  Certainly, I mean, it's always a problem. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=241.52s)]
*  But over the past 18 months, especially, I mean, we've seen this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=243.84s)]
*  We've all seen the governors and the mayors and prime ministers, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=247.36s)]
*  whoever they are out having their parties and going maskless and not socially distancing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=250.48s)]
*  and doing this and violating all their rules, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=254.96s)]
*  going on foreign holidays while they're telling their citizens to stay at home [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=257.12s)]
*  and to wear a mask and to, you know, they do this and do that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=261.6s)]
*  And that, I mean, it's like Animal Farm, just that level of outright hypocrisy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=264.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=270.16s)]
*  That's just been rammed in people's faces. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=270.66s)]
*  Zuby from the UK. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=274.96s)]
*  That went on for about an hour. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=276.56s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7X4K3eyeg&t=278.0s)]
