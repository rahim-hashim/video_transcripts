# Tucker Carlson: NPR is repulsive
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg)
*  Vince Colonais is a radio host in Washington, D.C., a very popular one, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=0.0s)]
*  deservedly so, and he joins us tonight to assess NPR. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=3.6s)]
*  Now, you live in Washington, you report on it on the radio. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=5.96s)]
*  Was there ever a question in your mind that this was state media? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=10.44s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=15.88s)]
*  Our mutual buddy, Chris Plank, calls them National Panhandler Radio, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=17.0s)]
*  appropriately, NPR. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And you know what's amazing about this? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=22.0s)]
*  They're trying to prove that they're not state media and they're relying on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=23.72s)]
*  everyone who's funded by the state in order to make that defense. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=27.28s)]
*  So Corrine Jean-Pierre stands there at the White House press briefing and says, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=30.32s)]
*  NPR is so independent, she gives a Braveheart style speech [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=33.96s)]
*  testing to their independence. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=37.8s)]
*  Do you think she would ever do that for Simon Atiba? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=39.28s)]
*  Like, not not in a million years, not in a million years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=41.8s)]
*  Of course, it's for NPR. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=44.32s)]
*  NPR cited Joel Roth, the former head of censorship at Twitter, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  as a guy who said they shouldn't be labeled state affiliated media. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=49.72s)]
*  Joel Roth and Twitter at the time were making millions of dollars [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=53.44s)]
*  from the federal government to censor the American public. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=56.6s)]
*  These are all completely biased people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=59.72s)]
*  And one last big thing that I noticed about this, Tucker, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  they say in all of their defenses, well, only one percent of our funding, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=65.04s)]
*  less than one percent, comes from the federal government. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=68.68s)]
*  Even that is deception. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=71.52s)]
*  Even that is a lie. NPR is a content organization. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=73.32s)]
*  The thousand member stations that they send content to all pay fees to NPR. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=76.88s)]
*  Guess where they get their money from? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=82.8s)]
*  That's right. The federal, state and local governments, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  as much as 23 percent of all of their funding comes from there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=86.84s)]
*  We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  And here they are playing a shell game. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=92.84s)]
*  And the only type of organization that plays that kind of deceptive shell game, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=94.68s)]
*  not a news organization, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=99.2s)]
*  one that is running a political operation on behalf of the government. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=101.32s)]
*  It's totally right. NPR is repulsive, but not quite as repulsive as its listeners. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=104.92s)]
*  The most privileged people in the world demanding welfare from the rest of us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=109.16s)]
*  Vince Colonese, who was on commercial radio, not working for the state. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=114.0s)]
*  Appreciate seeing you tonight. Thank you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDXIajryhHg&t=118.28s)]
