# Female swimmer who tied Lia Thomas speaks out
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0)
*  So college swimming has been in the news and not simply because it's an interesting athletic contest Riley Gaines is a college swimmer from Kentucky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=0.0s)]
*  She's biologically female at the women's 200 meter freestyle event at the NCAA swimming championships [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The NCAA force gains to compete against a biological male called Leah Thomas. You're seeing that race on your screen now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=13.08s)]
*  Remarkably Gaines tied Thomas despite the obvious disadvantage for fifth place [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=20.2s)]
*  But she says the NCAA is badly mishandled virtually every aspect of this competition [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We've been trying for months to get college swimmers on the show to talk about what they think about what's happening [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=29.52s)]
*  None have accepted except Riley Gaines. We're grateful for that. She joins us now, but against thanks so much for coming on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  So I'll just let you talk. Tell us what you think of your experience at this event [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=40.64s)]
*  Yeah, hi Tucker, thank you so much for having me and of course giving me this opportunity to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=46.32s)]
*  Speak for myself and so many other women athletes out there who you know [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=51.2s)]
*  Aren't as fortunate as me and have kind of been told they're not allowed to talk about it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=55.82s)]
*  And so thank you so much for that. But yeah, like you said me and Leah just recently tied at the NCAA championships [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=60.38s)]
*  And honestly, I think the NCAA handled everything extremely poorly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=69.54s)]
*  starting from when we finished and I went behind the podium to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=75.26s)]
*  collect my fifth place trophy and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=80.1s)]
*  You know [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=82.41999999999999s)]
*  They kind of blatantly told me that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=83.05999999999999s)]
*  Leo would hold the fifth place trophy and that I could pose with the sixth place trophy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=84.91999999999999s)]
*  for photos [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=90.82s)]
*  And would be mailed a fifth place trophy in the mail [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  So so not only are they allowing a biological male to compete in a women's competition? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  They're promoting that male over biological females who are competing. That's what I'm reading from what you said [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  Right and when I kind of questioned it, you know [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=106.72s)]
*  I asked him is there a reason why you're giving Leah the trophy? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=109.28s)]
*  He just explained to me that we're giving it in chronological order and I questioned him again, you know [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=112.8s)]
*  What does that mean? We tied what are we being chronological about? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=118.12s)]
*  And he kind of blatantly said we're just gonna give the trophy to Leah. We respect and admire your swim [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  But Leah needs to hold the trophy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=127.32s)]
*  Another word, don't ask questions [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=129.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=131.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=133.68s)]
*  Right. I was shocked and I know all the other swimmers who were standing by and listening to this were also shocked [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=134.68s)]
*  and I was standing right next to Leah and she heard it all and so it was kind of just [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=140.56s)]
*  Really baffling that this could happen and I know the NCAA wasn't prepared for a situation like this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=145.24s)]
*  Which just tells me when they were faced with it [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=151.8s)]
*  They protected such a small minority and turned their back on you know, what the organization and title nine really stands for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=155.4s)]
*  Well, I mean they just eliminated what it stands for it does seem to a non-swimmer who knows that swimming requires a lot of torture [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=163.2s)]
*  I mean nothing harder than swimming practice as you know, this seems like cheating to allow someone with a biological advantage to compete [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  Exactly, I think there's you know a difference between [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  Your sex and your gender identity and so I think that it's just been totally misconstrued and lost [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=183.44s)]
*  You know in the past couple years or so, but it's you know, finally gotten to the point where it's being [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=190.64s)]
*  Shown and it's completely violating women and women's rights, especially in sports [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  So you said a minute ago that you see you're speaking tonight on behalf of a lot of other female swimmers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=202.04s)]
*  Who've been told not to say a word just to be quiet and be eliminated [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  What do they think if you could speak for them? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=214.64s)]
*  Right, I know just solely off talking to tons and tons of NCAA swimmers that their athletic directors or their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=216.64s)]
*  Media people or their coaches or other outside influences have told them, you know, don't say anything [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=225.76s)]
*  Just avoid the situation, you know save face a little bit [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=231.92s)]
*  And I'm just fortunate enough to where I have such an amazing support system at the University of Kentucky [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  Whether that be from the athletic director all the way down to my head coach Lars Jorgensen [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=241.6s)]
*  But just speaking for them, it's just it's just totally wrong and I know I can't speak for everyone [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  But I am almost certain I'm speaking for a large majority of female athletes that this is just not okay [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=252.16s)]
*  And it's not fair and you know, we're dealing with something that's completely out of our control when we're racing, you know biological males [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=258.68s)]
*  Whether that be they have you know, different lung capacities. They're high obviously [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=266.2s)]
*  testosterone levels whether you be on testosterone blockers or not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=271.0s)]
*  It doesn't suppress, you know going through puberty as a male [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=274.96s)]
*  Especially, you know the one in question who swam three years as a male [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=279.68s)]
*  On you pen so it just it's just completely unfair and it's a matter of equity really [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean what we're seeing is just a lot of women who are not going to be able to go to the gym [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=290.12s)]
*  What we're seeing is cheating and it's remarkable that it takes bravery to point that out [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=294.92s)]
*  But it does and you are brave for doing it and we appreciate it rally. Thank you very much. Well, thank you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=298.44s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MKufBgav0&t=303.4s)]
