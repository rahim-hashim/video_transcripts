# Woman tells Tucker how she fought off attacker: ‘Always fight back’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM)
*  We're living through the most political moment in American history, but stories like the one you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=0.0s)]
*  just saw transcend politics. We don't know who anyone in that tape voted for, but we know exactly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=4.08s)]
*  how they felt as human beings, afraid and alone. And that's what happens when the government ceases [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=9.68s)]
*  conducting its most basic duty, which is to protect its citizens. And they won't. They won't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=17.52s)]
*  protect you. They've said that out loud and everybody knows it, again, no matter who they [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=22.56s)]
*  voted for. And so increasingly Americans are having to defend themselves. And once again, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=26.64s)]
*  anyone who tells you you can't defend yourself is your enemy. So here's an example that is amazing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=31.28s)]
*  and we think you'll agree that it is. In Tampa last month, a woman called Nishali Alma was working [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=37.04s)]
*  out in her apartment complex as Jim. And because she's a kind person, she let in a man who was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=42.72s)]
*  trying to open the door. That man then attempted to rape her. You're seeing the footage on your [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=48.64s)]
*  screen right now. Now Nishali Alma did not have a gun. She was in a gym, but she's extraordinarily [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=54.0s)]
*  tough and she was able to fight off the man who was trying to rape her. His name is Xavier Thomas [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=59.52s)]
*  Jones. Thomas Jones was later arrested after he tried to rape another woman in the apartment [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=64.16s)]
*  complex. The resilience and the strength you see in that video is so inspiring and so perfectly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=69.04s)]
*  captures the best part of America that we wanted to speak to Nishali Alma tonight. And she was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=76.16s)]
*  gracious enough to agree she joins us now. Nishali, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=80.56s)]
*  Anyone who watches that video, and again it's not a political point, but just has to stand back in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=85.36s)]
*  awe at your ferocity. How did you summon this? This man is bigger than you and he's totally [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  determined to hurt you and you literally fought him off. What were you thinking? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=96.0s)]
*  In my head, you know, whenever it was happening, I wasn't really fearful at all. In my head it was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=103.04s)]
*  just, I gotta fight him. I gotta do something, you know, and he was equal to me. He wasn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=109.04s)]
*  bigger than me. He wasn't anything more than my size and I kind of took that to my advantage, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=114.56s)]
*  to my own head and I fought him. There's a moment in the tape I've watched like four times, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  it's so interesting. He comes towards you and he hasn't even grabbed you yet and you determine [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=123.92s)]
*  this guy is going to hurt me. He's an enemy. You don't lie to yourself. You just immediately go [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=128.24s)]
*  after him. Why, and a lot of people don't do that. They lie to themselves. Why were you able to know [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  exactly what this man's intention was? Right, it's because my mom always told me don't let anybody [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=137.52s)]
*  ever approach you or touch you if you don't know them and as soon as he approached me, I knew I had [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=144.24s)]
*  to push him off or do something. Yeah, well you certainly did do something and the guy just, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=148.8s)]
*  yeah, you were so ferocious with him that he just finally gave up. Yeah, after a little bit of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=152.56s)]
*  resting on the ground, I yanked out his beard hairs and he eventually gave out. So what, I mean [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=159.84s)]
*  this is the scene I think that a lot of people, women particularly, fear you're alone in the gym [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=166.96s)]
*  at night and some rapist comes in and tries to literally rape you. What advice having lived [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  through it would you give people watching? You know, like I said, some people forget their key [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=177.44s)]
*  fob and they do let people in for the kindness of their hearts but always be cautious, always watch [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=184.08s)]
*  your back and if you're in that situation, fight back. Amen, amen, fight back. That is, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=190.0s)]
*  it's just wonderful but thank you for what you did and congratulations on succeeding. Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP-_jSCppHM&t=197.36s)]
