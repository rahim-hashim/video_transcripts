# Tucker: This is pure absurdity
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=0.0s)]
*  On Saturday, the 21st of January, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=2.96s)]
*  American Intel services watched, maybe slack jawed, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=5.12s)]
*  as a white helium balloon [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=8.72s)]
*  with an enormous payload swinging beneath it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=10.28s)]
*  lifted off from central China and began to float east [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=13.08s)]
*  over the North Pacific on the way here to the United States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=16.28s)]
*  Within a week, it had arrived. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=19.56s)]
*  On January 28th, the balloon entered US airspace [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=21.04s)]
*  over Alaska. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=23.84s)]
*  From there, it traveled [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=24.96s)]
*  over the Northwest Territories of Canada, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=26.04s)]
*  and then it dropped back into the United States over Idaho. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=27.76s)]
*  By last Wednesday, February 1st, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  it was spotted by civilians in the skies [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=33.52s)]
*  over southern Montana. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=35.84s)]
*  A man staring out of the window [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=37.56s)]
*  of an office building in Billings [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=38.88s)]
*  saw what he thought was a UFO, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=40.88s)]
*  it was too small to be a moon, he said, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=42.36s)]
*  and so he began to take pictures, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=44.6s)]
*  which soon appeared on social media. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  And then almost immediately, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=47.8s)]
*  the airspace over Billings, over the entire town, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=48.72s)]
*  was shut down. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  Commercial flights were diverted, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=52.28s)]
*  F-22 Raptors arrived from a nearby Air Force base, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=53.88s)]
*  along with refueling tankers, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=56.78s)]
*  and an AWACS surveillance plane. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  It was a big story. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=60.54s)]
*  So it was at this point, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=62.38s)]
*  when the existence of an unauthorized [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=63.86s)]
*  Chinese military aircraft [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=65.54s)]
*  over the continental United States [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=66.94s)]
*  became impossible to hide or deny. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=68.14s)]
*  At that point, officials around Joe Biden [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=70.5s)]
*  finally decided to tell him about it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=72.98s)]
*  Now, we don't know Joe Biden's reaction to this news, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=75.7s)]
*  but we do know his response. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=78.4s)]
*  Biden did nothing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=80.18s)]
*  He did not order the balloon shot down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=81.42s)]
*  He did not call for sanctions or punishment of any kind [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=83.18s)]
*  against the Chinese government that sent it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=86.02s)]
*  It was not until this weekend [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=88.82s)]
*  when the aircraft had traversed the entire United States, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=90.22s)]
*  including at least one classified [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapons installation, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  that an Air Force jet finally pierced it [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=96.06s)]
*  with a sidewinder missile off the coast of South Carolina. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Debris was still fluttering toward the ocean [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=101.5s)]
*  when the administration began telling lies, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=103.58s)]
*  many of them, about what had happened. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  That balloon posed no threat to American national security, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=108.46s)]
*  the Biden administration claimed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=111.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=113.06s)]
*  Because the balloon never transmitted data back to China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=114.02s)]
*  Now, how could officials know that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=117.74s)]
*  They never explained. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Nor did they say whether the Chinese military [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=121.22s)]
*  would send one of its aircraft all the way to the US [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  without a satellite uplink. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=125.92s)]
*  Apparently the Chinese just forgot. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=127.96s)]
*  They're not very good at technology. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  It was a nonsensical claim, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  but as far as we know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=133.9s)]
*  not a single reporter in Washington [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=134.74s)]
*  pressed the administration to explain that claim. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  And that's not really surprising. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=139.14s)]
*  Reporters in Washington no longer dig. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=140.92s)]
*  They transcribe. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=143.42s)]
*  And what they transcribe next is almost enough [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=145.42s)]
*  to make you cynical about the role of the press [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=147.82s)]
*  in a free society. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  It turns out, and we learned this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  from unnamed officials on background, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=153.04s)]
*  that allowing Chinese military aircraft [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  to surveil your country, including your missile silos, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=157.54s)]
*  is not the big deal the rest of us thought it was. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=159.82s)]
*  In fact, it's routine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=162.7s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=164.33999999999997s)]
*  Trump did it too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=165.48s)]
*  Quite a bit of it, actually. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=166.88s)]
*  At least three Chinese spy balloons [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=168.5s)]
*  flew over this country while Donald Trump was president. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=170.61999999999998s)]
*  And despite the anti-China rhetoric, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  he just let them pass. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  You didn't know that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  Now you do, so settle down. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  This is normal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=178.98s)]
*  In other words, everything Donald Trump did [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=180.98s)]
*  while president is bad, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=183.38s)]
*  except this letting Chinese spy balloons [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=185.42s)]
*  fly over the country, that's very good. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  And we're taking a lesson from him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=190.5s)]
*  So virtually every news organization in this country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  repeated that claim, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=195.1s)]
*  including some who should know better. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=195.94s)]
*  And of course, as soon as credulous reporters [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  wrote their dishonest stories, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=200.14s)]
*  the Democratic Party and the television stations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=201.78s)]
*  it controls repeated those stories as fact, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=203.94s)]
*  which was the whole point. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=207.62s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=208.86s)]
*  They are saying we should have shot down the balloon [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=210.06s)]
*  the minute we saw it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=213.26s)]
*  I would use two words in answering these GOP criticisms. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=216.54s)]
*  They are premature and they are political. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=222.62s)]
*  This is why we voted for Joe Biden, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=225.74s)]
*  because imagine if this had happened under Donald Trump. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=227.86s)]
*  The way in which the balloon was taken down [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  allows us to retrieve the parts of the balloons, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  to see what was actually in there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=236.42s)]
*  I'm just glad that there was no damage or threat [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=238.14s)]
*  to U.S. aviation operations [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=241.38s)]
*  and that this operation took place, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  was done in a very effective, excellent way. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=245.26s)]
*  Some of the statements from the Republicans, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  especially in the Senate, have just been asinine [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  and these jackasses going out again, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  I'll get my shotgun, I'm going to shoot down the balloon. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  Seriously, again, they just make clowns of themselves. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=258.74s)]
*  So the balloon shut down the airspace over Billings, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=264.1s)]
*  Montana, including the airport, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=268.14s)]
*  and as it moved east, commercial pilots [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=270.18s)]
*  said they were afraid of it, they were afraid of hitting it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=273.74s)]
*  So it's funny to see the transportation secretary [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=276.54s)]
*  who's in charge of all of this tell us it posed no threat, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=278.7s)]
*  no threat to transportation. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=281.82s)]
*  But the best is the dismissal of anyone who has concerns. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=284.38s)]
*  It's those Republicans again with their moonshot [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=286.78s)]
*  and their shotguns and their extra chromosomes, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  thinking it's okay to shoot down Chinese spy balloons. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=290.46s)]
*  When every sophisticated person knows, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=294.26s)]
*  Donald Trump himself knew the best way [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  to handle Chinese spy balloons, let them pass. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  Again, just like Trump did. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=302.14s)]
*  Trump, Trump, he's good all of a sudden. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=303.82s)]
*  So the question is, did Donald Trump [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=306.46s)]
*  let Chinese military aircraft float over the United States [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=309.14s)]
*  unmolested while he was president? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, someone asked him, he says he didn't. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=314.1s)]
*  In fact, in an interview yesterday, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  Trump said he had no idea there were any Chinese spy balloons [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=318.3s)]
*  over the United States when he was president. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  And he seemed to mean it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=323.98s)]
*  But it wasn't just Trump. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=326.1s)]
*  Trump's former national security advisor said the same thing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=328.22s)]
*  He said he'd never heard anything [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=330.42s)]
*  about Chinese spy balloons over the country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=332.1s)]
*  And you would think that he would have heard. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  Then the general in charge of NORAD, Glenn Van Hurk, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=337.22s)]
*  had the very same reaction, quote, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=340.66s)]
*  It's my responsibility to detect threats to North America. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=341.82s)]
*  I will tell you that we did not detect those threats. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=344.86s)]
*  So somehow NORAD, the most sophisticated, supposedly, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=348.02s)]
*  monitoring system in the world, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=350.94s)]
*  missed those Chinese spy balloons too, three of them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=352.82s)]
*  And by the way, so did the director of national intelligence, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  the man whose job it is to know America's secrets. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=358.3s)]
*  He said he'd never heard of Chinese spy balloons [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=360.46s)]
*  over the country during the Trump administration. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=362.46s)]
*  Here's former DNI John Radcliffe. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=365.1s)]
*  Do you remember during the Trump administration [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  when photographers on the ground [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=369.98s)]
*  and commercial airline pilots were talking about [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=372.1s)]
*  spy balloon over the United States, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=374.98s)]
*  that people could look up and see even with the naked eye [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=377.14000000000004s)]
*  and that a media that hated Donald Trump wasn't reporting? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=379.82s)]
*  I don't remember that either because it didn't happen. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=383.06s)]
*  It didn't happen, said the former director [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  of national intelligence. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=388.86s)]
*  You can see why he thinks that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=390.18s)]
*  So again, according to media accounts, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  at least one of these three Trump-era Chinese spy balloons [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=394.74s)]
*  floated all the way to Texas in the center of the country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=398.74s)]
*  And yet inside the US government at the very highest levels, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=402.26s)]
*  no one seemed to know that it happened. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=405.58s)]
*  Well, how could that have occurred really? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=408.02s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration had an answer. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=411.38s)]
*  Speaking on background to its shills in the media, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=413.7s)]
*  unnamed officials explained that these Chinese spy flights [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=416.34s)]
*  were actually never reported to President Trump [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=419.18s)]
*  or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  or even to the secretary of defense. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=423.86s)]
*  Why weren't they reported? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=425.41999999999996s)]
*  Because they weren't important enough. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  They were, quote, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=428.42s)]
*  relatively minor territorial incursions. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so a Chinese military aircraft hovering over Texas, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  more than a thousand miles from the Pacific Ocean, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=437.21999999999997s)]
*  is a minor territorial incursion. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=440.3s)]
*  That's what they said. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=443.82s)]
*  It's pure absurdity. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=444.9s)]
*  But once again, no reporter in Washington pushed back. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=446.18s)]
*  They just repeated the lie. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=448.98s)]
*  And then without warning, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=450.78s)]
*  the White House changed its talking point, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=452.14s)]
*  undermining the first lie. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=454.02s)]
*  Actually, they explained today, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=455.38s)]
*  nobody knew that Chinese spy balloons [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=457.74s)]
*  were floating over America during the Trump administration. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=460.3s)]
*  We didn't know. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=463.26s)]
*  We just found out pretty recently. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=464.78s)]
*  Watch the smarter but more dishonest White House spokesman [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=467.1s)]
*  spin that tale. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=469.46s)]
*  I can tell you that we discovered these flights [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=471.18s)]
*  after we came into office. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=479.3s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the specifics [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=483.14s)]
*  of how we did the forensics. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=484.9s)]
*  I think you can understand [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=487.38s)]
*  that we're going to be careful about that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=488.46s)]
*  They're not going to get into the specifics of the forensics. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=492.29999999999995s)]
*  Oh, the forensics. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=494.85999999999996s)]
*  But the one thing they were really shocked by [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  when they took control of the US government [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=498.17999999999995s)]
*  was how soft on China Trump was. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=499.5s)]
*  They had no idea. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=501.17999999999995s)]
*  He was letting these Chinese spy flights go over. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=502.58s)]
*  They were shocked as shocked as anyone would be. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=504.41999999999996s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=506.9s)]
*  Now, of course, once again, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=507.73999999999995s)]
*  they can't say more because it's classified. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=508.7s)]
*  Wish we could, sorry. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=510.73999999999995s)]
*  So what is the real story here? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=512.94s)]
*  Honestly, we don't know. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=514.94s)]
*  The Pentagon ignored our many questions today. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=516.14s)]
*  Of course they did because we're not going to transcribe them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=518.34s)]
*  So once again, the people who owe you the truth [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=520.9s)]
*  are lying to you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=523.54s)]
*  So all tonight we know with certainty [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=524.98s)]
*  is that the Chinese military just flew an aircraft [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=527.5s)]
*  that reportedly contained explosives [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=530.02s)]
*  over the entire length of the United States [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=532.18s)]
*  and got away with it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwV7li-duQ&t=534.7s)]
