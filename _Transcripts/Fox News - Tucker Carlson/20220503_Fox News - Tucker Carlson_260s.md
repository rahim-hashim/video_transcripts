# Ingraham: It’s a great day for the pro-life movement
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU)
*  There's a lot to unpack here, and so we thought we would start with an actual lawyer, someone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=0.0s)]
*  who knows a lot about the Supreme Court, our friend Laura Ingraham, the host of the Ingraham [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=6.44s)]
*  Angle, on the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  She joins us tonight to assess. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=10.78s)]
*  Laura, I just got to ask you something that's sort of allotted over, because I know you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=11.78s)]
*  know a lot more about it than I do, but the fact that this was leaked, you know how the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=14.68s)]
*  court works. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  How big a deal is that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=19.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=20.68s)]
*  The first thing that happened when I clerked on the court, the first day that all the clerks [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=21.68s)]
*  from that term were all together, it was like 40 or so of us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=26.18s)]
*  Chief Justice Rehnquist said to us, if you are thinking at any point in time of divulging [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  what happens within the walls of this court, especially anything about internal deliberations, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=38.36s)]
*  your legal career is over. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=46.32s)]
*  I mean, it is a great privilege to clerk at that court. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=48.08s)]
*  It's considered by many the highest honor you could have as a young lawyer, just leaving [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=52.88s)]
*  law school in my case. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=59.08s)]
*  And that's how you betray the trust of the justices, liberals, conservatives, doesn't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=61.72s)]
*  matter, and the institution of the court. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=65.52s)]
*  It's never happened before. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=69.8s)]
*  It's going to change the way the court operates. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=71.72s)]
*  And liberal justices, conservative justices, all should come together and together release [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  a statement saying, we condemn this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=81.84s)]
*  We will find out who did this, and this will never happen again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=86.12s)]
*  And explain to the American people why this matters. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  I know they announced an investigation today of the marshal's office, and I'll look forward [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=92.86s)]
*  to seeing where that leads. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=96.3s)]
*  But someone knows who did this besides the leaker in that court. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=98.78s)]
*  But they just did this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  And look, I don't agree with Stephen Breyer, but I think he's smart and I think he's interesting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  And you know, he's an American who got the job legitimately. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=109.34s)]
*  He shouldn't be forced out with a leak because people don't like his skin color. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=112.58s)]
*  That happened in very much the same way this did, and no one did anything about it or even [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=116.58s)]
*  really noticed it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, because the liberals who claim to be the defenders of democracy, as you noted in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=121.86s)]
*  the open, today they're kind of the anti-democrats. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=127.62s)]
*  The euphemistic language, Tucker, is everyone grabs up, we're pro-choice, we're this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=132.66s)]
*  No, no, they are the wrecking ball to American democracy today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=137.34s)]
*  Imagine if the case was reversed and we had heard through a leak, egregious leak, that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=142.94s)]
*  the court was coming down the other way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  And imagine if mobs of people descended at the court screaming what could be described [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  as threatening language towards some of the just, or very derogatory language. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=156.26s)]
*  Oh, you'd have Nancy Pelosi and the whole crowd up there today saying, we need to wall [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=159.78s)]
*  off the city again, we need to put the fences back up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=164.26s)]
*  And this is, those are the insurrectionists trying to undermine the legitimacy of the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=167.66s)]
*  country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=172.14s)]
*  That's what they would be saying today and tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=173.14s)]
*  So I mean, I think abortion is one of the saddest things I can imagine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=176.26s)]
*  I really think it's a tragedy, and I mean that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  Some people think it's the road to happiness, but why shouldn't we have a vote on it? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=181.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm serious. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=185.1s)]
*  Like, if you love abortion, why wouldn't you welcome a national vote that, or a state-by-state [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=186.1s)]
*  vote that define its parameters and its legality? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=190.5s)]
*  Wait a second, Tucker. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=192.94s)]
*  Tucker, you and I have been friends for, I don't know how long, a long, long time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=193.94s)]
*  You actually think these people trust Americans to vote? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=196.78s)]
*  I mean, really vote on these types of issues? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  If they were so confident that this was so popular a position, they'd be like, bring [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  it on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=207.62s)]
*  Let's see it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=208.62s)]
*  I mean, all 50 states, you bet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=209.62s)]
*  Everybody have your say, and that's democracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=210.62s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=212.58s)]
*  But they want to take a whole slate of issues off the table from the American people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=213.58s)]
*  And it's not going to, this is not going to be settled here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=217.94s)]
*  They are going to keep fighting and keep ramping up the temperature. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=221.26000000000002s)]
*  But look, it's a great day for the pro-life movement across this country, those who've [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=223.82s)]
*  toiled and prayed and done it the right way, overwhelmingly, peacefully and respectfully. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=228.3s)]
*  That is the process, and people should celebrate that tonight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=234.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  And we should not be intimidated by the mob. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  We've been through this before. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=239.3s)]
*  They got everyone back on their heels. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=240.72s)]
*  Oh, we can't do anything about it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, we should not put up with this stuff. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=243.3s)]
*  No violence. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  Period. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocATrY1edpU&t=247.14000000000001s)]
