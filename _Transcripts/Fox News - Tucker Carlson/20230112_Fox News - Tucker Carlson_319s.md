# Tucker Carlson: People are getting very rich from this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM)
*  So this week, as promised, Republicans who now control the House set up a new committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=0.0s)]
*  modeled after the famous Frank Church committee of the 70s to investigate the FBI and the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=6.08s)]
*  intel agencies which are playing what appear to be decisive roles in American politics. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=11.92s)]
*  Now that's an offense against democracy. You can have a democracy in which government agencies [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=16.8s)]
*  secretly work to control the outcome. That's tyranny, of course. No decent person should want that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=21.04s)]
*  But Republicans, rather than Democrats, rather than welcoming the scrutiny and the transparency, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=28.16s)]
*  the sunlight, are responding with panic. Watch this. Today we have the first of their many [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  demands on display. An open-ended investigation into whatever conspiracy theories may be headlining [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=40.32s)]
*  the right-wing echo chamber at the moment. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=46.64s)]
*  Rez 12, the Insurrection Protection Committee. This is all about deep state nonsense. Let's call it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=52.24s)]
*  what it really is, the Republican committee to obstruct justice. Russia is one of our most [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=61.2s)]
*  dangerous adversaries. We're in the middle of a national security quagmire, and to undermine that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=66.4s)]
*  through investigations of the FBI and central intelligence is going to be extremely dangerous. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=72.56s)]
*  The MAGA extremist fringe of the Republican party will use this committee to push QAnon [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=77.68s)]
*  conspiracy theories and lies from truth social. They're going to use it to gin up fake investigations [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=82.48s)]
*  into non-existent scandals. I think we need to just start calling this the tinfoil hat committee. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, so there's verification right there. If you're wondering if the federal agencies, FBI, CIA, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=95.92000000000002s)]
*  and a bunch of others are actually being used as tools of the Democratic party to change political [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  outcomes, now we know for sure. Because if you're a government official and you are panicked at the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=106.8s)]
*  idea that what you are doing will become public, you're doing something wrong by definition. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=113.12s)]
*  And it's not just the intel agencies whose behavior they want to keep secret. Democrats [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=118.8s)]
*  in Congress also don't want you to have any idea where the hundred billion dollars went that we've [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=123.36s)]
*  sent to Ukraine. So we sent a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine and then Condi Rice, who's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=128.8s)]
*  still talking about foreign policy in public amazingly, announces this weekend that Ukraine [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=135.2s)]
*  is losing. Okay, so where'd all the money go? Well, you can't know that. What does Zelensky and his [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=139.6s)]
*  wife, what'd they do with it? This weekend, Joe Biden announced that we're going to send [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  still more billions to Ukraine this month. Today we jointly announced, you've already gotten copies [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  of it, a statement saying that we're going to increase the support for Ukraine. We are going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  to provide the Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, the United States, to the Ukrainians. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=161.36s)]
*  And the Germans are going to provide the martyr infantry fighting vehicles that they have to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Ukrainians. And in addition, we're going to help defend Ukraine against Russian air attacks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  Germany's also announced that today it's going to provide the Ukrainians to deal with the air attacks, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=177.68s)]
*  a Patriot air defense system. We're going to provide an additional Patriot air defense battery. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=186.64s)]
*  This is crazy, but there's actually a reason for it. People are getting very rich from this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  People are getting very rich from this. That's why Washington supports it. And very soon, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  we're going to give you a case study on who exactly is getting rich from it. Some of the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  people who are promoting this war that is killing an endless number of Ukrainians are personally [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=212.72s)]
*  benefiting from it. And you should know that. But the cost to us is profound. In fact, we're [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=218.16s)]
*  sending so much military equipment to Ukraine, to Zelensky and his wife, that we're running out of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=221.76s)]
*  weapons for our own military to defend our own country. And that's not a guess. The secretary [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=225.84s)]
*  of the Navy, Carlos del Toro, just said that out loud, quote, with regards to deliveries of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=230.24s)]
*  weapons systems for the fight in Ukraine. Yeah, that's always a concern for us. If the conflict [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=235.36s)]
*  does go on for another six months or another year, it certainly continues to stress the supply [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=239.76s)]
*  chain in ways that are challenging. In other words, you can either defend Ukraine's borders [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  or you can defend the United States of America. Which is it? Well, most members of Congress are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=249.84s)]
*  choosing Ukraine, which tells you everything, but a small number are coming to their senses. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  In the House, Thomas Massie of Kentucky is one of them. We've spent more in Ukraine, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=259.2s)]
*  the U.S. Congress has, than we spend on all of our roads and bridges in an entire year, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=266.08s)]
*  the entire infrastructure of this country, the roads and bridges, the real infrastructure. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=271.68s)]
*  We don't spend as much on that here as we spent on Ukraine in nine months. I think that's despicable. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=276.64s)]
*  Our priorities are all out of whack. And I'll finish with this. We're trying to get the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=284.56s)]
*  documents here to find out where the money went. What we really need is a full audit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=290.24s)]
*  So this is a crime against our country being perpetrated by the Democratic Party with the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=296.32s)]
*  full buy-in of most Republicans, but a few have dissented. J.D. Vance just started in the U.S. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=300.56s)]
*  Senate representing the state of Ohio. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBo6zEwduyM&t=306.32s)]
