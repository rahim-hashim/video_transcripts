# Dr. Oz: 'We are going to win on the issues'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI)
*  His challenger is Dr. Romant Oz, who joins us tonight. Dr. Oz, thank you very much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=6.24s)]
*  In the case of Federman, since he is currently an office holder, he can be traced to very specific [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  policies that have increased violent crime in the state of Pennsylvania. Did they not think that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=14.24s)]
*  anyone was going to notice that when they put this man up for office? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=19.52s)]
*  Well, it's shocking when you hear Krauser speak there about a city he thinks he's protecting, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  but I've been in Philadelphia a lot during this campaign. I live in in Philly. I went to school in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=28.48s)]
*  West Philly, and you actually talk to the people there. What they say is they don't want to be part [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=34.4s)]
*  of a white woke experiment, a social experiment where they're left with the consequences. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=38.0s)]
*  And Federman, to your point, said that if he had a magic wand to do anything he wanted to, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=43.36s)]
*  his goal would be to release murderers from life in prison. Now, Tucker, can you imagine having a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=48.64s)]
*  magic wand to do anything you want? I mean, you could take care of inflation, although you don't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=54.16s)]
*  need a magic wand for that. But there's lots of things you could do. But releasing murderers from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=57.6s)]
*  life in prison without asking the families what they think, and oftentimes voting against the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  other members of the pro-board, even other Democrats, is not aligned with the values of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=66.72s)]
*  Pennsylvanians. Yes, that's the position he has taken. So many Pennsylvanians have died of fentanyl [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=71.6s)]
*  OD, and opioid more broadly, but fentanyl, I would say, specifically in the last year, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=78.64s)]
*  that it really is, the numbers are almost beyond belief. And yet I don't think stopping fentanyl [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=82.8s)]
*  importation, dealing, punishing fentanyl peddlers is a feature of any Democratic campaign. Why is that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=89.84s)]
*  Because they're ignoring the humanitarian crisis they have created with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=97.76s)]
*  feckless policies on the border. They've funded cartels inadvertently who make money trafficking [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=101.2s)]
*  human beings, take the money, buy fentanyl from China. They don't say anything to China about that, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=106.88s)]
*  by the way. The fentanyl is brought to America like pieces of candy and unfortunately ends up [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=111.12s)]
*  in people's mailboxes. But Fetterman goes beyond that. That's what all the Democrats do. Fetterman [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=115.92s)]
*  says, I want to legalize all drugs. I want heroin injection sites. And he actually embraced a measure [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=120.72s)]
*  in Oregon, which was enacted two years ago, with exactly those rules. And listen carefully, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=127.2s)]
*  this is critical. 40 percent increase in overdose death rates. That's to be expected if you legalize [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  all drugs. But here's the part that catches me. 50 percent increase in homicides. You create a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=136.4s)]
*  lawless environment. Police aren't allowed to do their job, which is to confiscate narcotics. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=142.08s)]
*  And this is the world that he's trying to create for us. And by the way, if you're bothered by this, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  and I was bothered enough to run against them, please go to DrHouse.com and support me, because [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=150.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party doesn't even know this about him. They're just trying to get the 51st Senate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  seat. So they're pouring money into Pennsylvania. So DrHouse.com will at least give me some support [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=158.96s)]
*  against them. But we're going to win on the issues. Just like all the Republicans that you've [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=163.68s)]
*  mentioned today, the debate we're having tomorrow night is going to reinforce John Fetterman's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  radical positions. The momentum we have is a direct response of focusing on kitchen table issues. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=171.44s)]
*  Crime, drugs, we mentioned both with the border, and of course the economy, everyone's focused on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=177.12s)]
*  Although if you're in Philadelphia right now, you're worried about your life, and companies are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=182.4s)]
*  leaving, big chains, leaving the city because they're done with the experiment. I got to just [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=186.4s)]
*  ask you, and I'm sure you don't like to go to motive, but it's just amazing to me. 107,000 [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=191.52s)]
*  Americans died of drug ODs last year, and here's a guy promoting drug legalization when we know it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=196.8s)]
*  will result in more deaths. Why would anyone push an idea like that at a time like this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Because they're more concerned about the perpetrator or the criminal than the innocent [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  and the victims. They don't hear the stories that I've been witnessing as I campaign of moms telling [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  me that they've found their children blue and dead because they went on Facebook and signed up [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=219.92s)]
*  for an over-the-counter pain pill and ended up having fentanyl in it. We confiscated seven times [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  more fentanyl in Pennsylvania this quarter than two years ago, according to the state patrol. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=230.64s)]
*  And by the way, all the law enforcement groups have endorsed me because they know Fetterman [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  doesn't have their back, and I'll fight hard to let them do their job. But Tucker, that's part of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  the problem. When you talk to the left-leaning politicians, on the far left especially, they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=244.0s)]
*  don't want the police to do their jobs. They don't want anyone to do their jobs, and they don't want [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=248.8s)]
*  to therefore deal with the consequences of it, so they don't come downtown to the prayer vigils I've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=253.12s)]
*  attended. They haven't gone to Kensington, which is the largest open-air drug market in the country, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=257.76s)]
*  that we created with these bizarre beliefs that you can give people drugs and it's okay. Believe me, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=262.32s)]
*  taking heroin long-term is not a good strategy. You're not going to do well. And because I know [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=268.48s)]
*  that and I love these people and I see the divine spark going out in their eyes, I want to take them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=272.32s)]
*  to detox, put them in rehab, and I'll fund that when I'm in the Senate. Why wouldn't you want that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=276.8s)]
*  And again, this is something we should all be rooting for. This should be a bipartisan desire [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=281.36s)]
*  to make the country stable. It's really stunning to me. And what's also stunning is I think you're [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=285.6s)]
*  going to win this Senate seat in a democratic state because of the things you're saying right [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  there. And I appreciate it. Dr. Oz, thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=296.24s)]
*  from Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpxZmG8HWI&t=306.8s)]
