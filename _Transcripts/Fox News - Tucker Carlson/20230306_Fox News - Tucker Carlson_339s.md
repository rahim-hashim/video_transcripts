# Tucker: This video tells a different story of Jan 6
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk)
*  These are the pictures you've seen of January 6th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=0.0s)]
*  They're familiar because they've been playing on a loop on every media outlet in America for the last two years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=5.0s)]
*  There's a reason for that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=13.0s)]
*  But it turns out there's quite a bit of video you haven't seen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=16.0s)]
*  And that video tells a very different story about what happened on January 6th. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=20.0s)]
*  More than 40,000 hours of surveillance footage from in and around the Capitol have been withheld from the public. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=25.0s)]
*  And once you see the video, you'll understand why. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=31.0s)]
*  Taken as a whole, the video record does not support the claim that January 6th was an insurrection. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=34.0s)]
*  In fact, it demolishes that claim. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=40.0s)]
*  And that's exactly why the Democratic Party and its allies in the media prevented you from seeing it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=43.0s)]
*  By controlling the images you were allowed to view from January 6th, they controlled how the public understood that day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=48.0s)]
*  They could lie about what happened and you would never know the difference. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=55.0s)]
*  Those lies had a purpose. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=59.0s)]
*  They created a pretext for a federal crackdown on opponents of the Uniparty in Washington. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=61.0s)]
*  Our office wanted to ensure that there was shock and all that we could charge as many people as possible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=66.0s)]
*  The first thing you notice from viewing the full video record of January 6th is just how many people entered the Capitol building that day. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=71.0s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of people, possibly thousands, over the course of about two hours. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=79.0s)]
*  The crowd was enormous. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=84.0s)]
*  A small percentage of them were hooligans. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=86.0s)]
*  They committed vandalism. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=89.0s)]
*  You've seen their pictures again and again. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=90.0s)]
*  But the overwhelming majority weren't. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=93.0s)]
*  They were peaceful. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=95.0s)]
*  They were orderly and meek. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=97.0s)]
*  These were not insurrectionists. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=98.0s)]
*  They were sightseers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=100.0s)]
*  Footage from inside the Capitol overturns the story you've heard about January 6th. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=102.0s)]
*  Protesters queue up in neat little lines. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=107.0s)]
*  They give each other tours outside the speaker's office. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=110.0s)]
*  They take cheerful selfies and they smile. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=113.0s)]
*  They're not destroying the Capitol. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=115.0s)]
*  They obviously revere the Capitol. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=117.0s)]
*  They're there because they believe the election was stolen from them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=120.0s)]
*  They believe in the system. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=123.0s)]
*  Here's the man you've heard referred to as the QAnon shaman outside the Senate chamber. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=125.0s)]
*  These are not rioters. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=130.0s)]
*  These are people who wandered over from a political rally. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=131.0s)]
*  We will not let them silence your voices. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=134.0s)]
*  After the rally, they walked down Pennsylvania Avenue where organizers had secured a federal permit to hold a legal rally on the grounds of the Capitol. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=137.0s)]
*  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=145.0s)]
*  Once at the Capitol building, things began to get chaotic. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=154.0s)]
*  Capitol police officers fired tear gas into the crowd. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=157.0s)]
*  A few at the front of the herd broke windows. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=161.0s)]
*  Someone opened the doors and many hundreds of others just walked in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=163.0s)]
*  We're going to make that the story. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=167.0s)]
*  Of course, they did make it the story. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=169.0s)]
*  And at the center of it, the single most famous person arrested that day was a Navy veteran from Arizona called Jacob Chansley, often referred to as the QAnon shaman. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=171.0s)]
*  The so-called QAnon shaman. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=181.0s)]
*  Someone named Q Shaman. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=183.0s)]
*  Jacob Chansley became the face of January 6th, a dangerous conspiracy theorist dressed in outlandish costume who led the violent insurrection to overthrow American democracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=184.0s)]
*  For these crimes, Chansley was sentenced to nearly four years in prison, far more time than many violent criminals now receive. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=195.0s)]
*  What did Jacob Chansley do to receive this punishment? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=202.0s)]
*  To this day, there is dispute over how Chansley got into the Capitol building. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=206.0s)]
*  But according to our review of the internal surveillance video, it is very clear what happened once he got inside. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=210.0s)]
*  Virtually every moment of his time inside the Capitol was caught on tape. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=218.0s)]
*  The tapes show that Capitol police never stopped Jacob Chansley. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=222.0s)]
*  They helped him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=226.0s)]
*  They acted as his tour guides. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=228.0s)]
*  Here's video of Chansley in the Senate chamber. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=230.0s)]
*  Capitol police officers take him to multiple entrances and even try to open locked doors for him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=233.0s)]
*  We counted at least nine officers who were within touching distance of unarmed Jacob Chansley. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=240.0s)]
*  Not one of them even tried to slow him down. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=246.0s)]
*  Chansley understood that Capitol police were his allies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=249.0s)]
*  Video shows him giving thanks for them in a prayer on the floor of the Senate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=253.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=257.0s)]
*  Thank you, Heavenly Father, for paying the inspiration needed to these police officers to allow us into this building. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=258.0s)]
*  Contrast the reality of what Jacob Chansley did in the Capitol building on January 6th, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=265.0s)]
*  the indisputable facts recorded on video, some of which has never before been seen, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=271.0s)]
*  with the depiction of Jacob Chansley that you've seen in the media for more than two years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=275.0s)]
*  He's a terrorist, they said. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=280.0s)]
*  He should be killed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=282.0s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=283.0s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=284.0s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=286.0s)]
*  Like, if it, you burst into the United States, if he was dressed like Bin Laden, would you have shot him? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=287.0s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=293.0s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=294.0s)]
*  It makes you wonder, who are the violent extremists here? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=295.0s)]
*  Not Jacob Chansley. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=298.0s)]
*  And the video proves that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=300.0s)]
*  But you would never have known from the media coverage. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=302.0s)]
*  The people sitting in the chairs need to be sitting in a jail cell. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=305.0s)]
*  Chansley is in a jail cell. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=309.0s)]
*  He's been there for months. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=311.0s)]
*  If he was in fact committing such a grave crime, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=313.0s)]
*  why didn't the officers who were standing right next to him place him under arrest? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=316.0s)]
*  Until now, no one could even prove that even happened. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=322.0s)]
*  But it did. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy7MLGAPBk&t=325.0s)]
