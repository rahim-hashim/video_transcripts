# Former Navy SEAL reflects on Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ)
*  Now Jack Carr is the author of The Terminalist, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  now a hit show on Amazon Prime. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=2.5s)]
*  He's also former Navy SEAL veteran [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  who served in Afghanistan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=6.54s)]
*  Jack, it's so good to see you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=8.34s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  I know you have some thoughts and feelings, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=12.34s)]
*  especially as we look at what happened one year ago. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=14.84s)]
*  I do, and as does every person who went over there [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=19.98s)]
*  and put their life on the line, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=22.98s)]
*  and some who returned home facing the physical [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=24.76s)]
*  and the emotional trauma of their experience over there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=28.98s)]
*  But we learned early on in special operations in particular [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=32.02s)]
*  to not rush to your death. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=34.72s)]
*  And that means to take a breath, look around, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  make a good, thoughtful call [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=40.06s)]
*  for those on your left and right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=42.76s)]
*  That's what you owe them, that's what you owe their families, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=44.32s)]
*  that's what you owe the mission. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=46.2s)]
*  And instead, what happened at a strategic level [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=47.56s)]
*  as we got down to these final days in Afghanistan [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=50.7s)]
*  is we rushed to our death. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=53.3s)]
*  And that's why so many Americans [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=55.38s)]
*  who never had any touchpoint with the military whatsoever [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=56.96s)]
*  could apply a bit of common sense [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  to what they were seeing on television [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  and start asking questions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=63.9s)]
*  Why did we give up Bagram? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Why did we put our service members [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  at a tactically disadvantageous position [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=69.14s)]
*  at the Kabul airport, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=71.82s)]
*  which resulted unfortunately in those deaths at Abbey Gate? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=73.34s)]
*  And to say nothing of those who are still dealing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=78.12s)]
*  with the physical wounds of that day [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=81.02s)]
*  and the emotional wounds of that day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=84.32s)]
*  We rushed to our death at the end, it was unnecessary. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=86.6s)]
*  We had 20 years to learn lessons [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=89.14s)]
*  and we neglected to do that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  We didn't even go back to the Soviet experience [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=93.52s)]
*  in Afghanistan, we didn't go back to the British experience, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=95.88s)]
*  we didn't even have to go back to Genghis Khan [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=97.82s)]
*  or Alexander the Great. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=100.02s)]
*  We had our own 20 years of experience in Afghanistan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=101.16s)]
*  and we neglected to apply those lessons to our withdrawal [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=104.86s)]
*  and it really is unforgivable, as is the accountability. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=107.86s)]
*  We have seen over that 20 years, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=112.16s)]
*  zero accountability from our senior leaders [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=113.92s)]
*  and that continues to this day, they have all failed upward. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=117.22s)]
*  Yeah, Jack, I know you've spoken and written a lot [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=121.86s)]
*  about this and about how, especially in recent history [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=124.22s)]
*  and you're a student of history [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=127.54s)]
*  and a prolific reader and author, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=129.0s)]
*  how general officers are no longer held accountable. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=130.84s)]
*  As you say, they are promoted upward. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  What do you say to the families [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=136.94s)]
*  who are looking for that accountability as we wrap up here? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=138.78s)]
*  Well, that's what we owe, not just those families, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=142.44s)]
*  but future generations as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  If we fail to take these lessons [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=145.84s)]
*  and apply those lessons going forward as wisdom, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=147.6s)]
*  then those deaths have been in vain. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=150.68s)]
*  So that's what we really owe them, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  is to apply those lessons going forward as wisdom. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=154.78s)]
*  But we can look back, we can look back [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  to what was our country like before 1947 and after 1947. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=159.72s)]
*  We stopped holding our senior military leaders accountable [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=164.72s)]
*  for whatever reason after World War II. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=168.16s)]
*  George Marshall did it before World War II, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=170.78s)]
*  all through World War II, put those generals and admirals, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=172.82s)]
*  all those names that we know today [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=175.62s)]
*  as those who led us to victory. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=177.62s)]
*  We all know those names. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  After World War II, we stopped firing those admirals [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=180.48s)]
*  and those generals who didn't measure up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  for whatever reason, and that continues today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=186.76s)]
*  And that's gonna have to change [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=189.1s)]
*  if we want the populace, the citizens, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=190.38s)]
*  to trust in our military leadership. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=192.62s)]
*  And the results speak for themselves. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  Jack, thank you for your service, your leadership, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=196.94s)]
*  and your voice, I appreciate it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c16gBsgmaQ&t=199.46s)]
