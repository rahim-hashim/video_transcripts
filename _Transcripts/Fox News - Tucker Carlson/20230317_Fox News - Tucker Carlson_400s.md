# Will Cain: Biden takes St. Patrick's day seriously
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. I'm Will Kane in for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=0.0s)]
*  Tucker and it's a big day. It's a big day for the Irish and the president of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=4.32s)]
*  United States would like to wish all of you a happy St. Patty, St. Patrick's, you [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=9.76s)]
*  know, the thing. Joe Biden loves St. Patrick's Day because he's told us for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=16.68s)]
*  decades. He's Irish. He's even in the Irish American Hall of Fame. His secret [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=21.48s)]
*  service code name is Celtic. That's how Irish he is. Joe Biden's proud of that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=26.6s)]
*  Here he was today with the Irish prime minister. Every St. Patrick's Day, every [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=33.2s)]
*  Irishman goes out to find another Irishman to make a speech to. Well, that's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=39.36s)]
*  why I'm here. I, like all of you, take pride in my Irish ancestry and as long [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  as I can remember it's been sort of part of my soul how I've been raised. He takes [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  pride in his ancestry, but he did go on to joke that he's not really Irish [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=56.24s)]
*  because, well, he's sober and his family isn't in jail. At least not yet. Because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  get it, the Irish drink and they get arrested a lot. Watch. I've been to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=66.92s)]
*  Ireland many times but not to actually look up to find my actual family members [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=72.04s)]
*  and there are so many and they actually weren't in jail. They were all, but all [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=76.16s)]
*  kidding aside, I met the Bluets and the Finnegans and all of the folks who were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=82.24s)]
*  related to. I'm the only Irishman you ever met though that's never had a drink [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  so I'm okay. I'm really not Irish. Well, watching all this you have to wonder how [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=90.16s)]
*  Joe Biden's countrymen in the Puerto Rican community are thinking tonight. For [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  years Joe Biden has told us that Puerto Ricans raised him and yet here he is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=101.0s)]
*  giving all the credit to the Irish. They probably feel pretty slighted in Puerto [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Rico or maybe they're relieved. Either way, the facts of Joe Biden's biography [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=109.04s)]
*  are getting harder and harder to pin down. You see, it's not just the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=113.56s)]
*  Puerto Ricans who are being airbrushed away. What about all the Poles? I mean, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=117.28s)]
*  the Greeks who played key roles in Joe Biden's upbringing. See, when it's not [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=121.68s)]
*  ST Patrick's Day, Joe Biden talks about them a lot. You know, I grew up in a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=126.56s)]
*  heavily Irish Catholic community in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in a heavily [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=131.88s)]
*  Italian Polish community in Claremont, Delaware. I also want to acknowledge [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=135.44s)]
*  someone else who means a great deal to our family. Rabbi Michael Beals of the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=140.12s)]
*  congregation, Beth Shalom in Wilmington, Delaware. That's where I received my [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=146.72s)]
*  education. I probably went to shul more than many of you did. You all think I'm [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=151.04s)]
*  kidding. We have a very relative terms, large Puerto Rican population in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=161.12s)]
*  Delaware. I was sort of raised in the Puerto Rican community at home. I got my [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=166.08s)]
*  education for real in the black church. That's not I verbally. It's a fact. I'm [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  an honorary Greek. Not only today, not only today, but every day. Black [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=178.56s)]
*  Puerto Rican, Greek, Pole, Italian, Jewish, Puerto Rican. I think I said that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=186.48s)]
*  one twice. We're just gonna have to take Joe's word for it because it's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Friday. And it's also kind of funny to imagine this Benetton of an upbringing [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=196.0s)]
*  if it were true, even though it's clearly not true. So we got to ask, how [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  does a Puerto Rican Greek Irishman celebrate ST Patty's Day? Well, we've [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=205.72s)]
*  been able to identify that Joe Biden has something of a tradition for this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=209.42s)]
*  holiday. First, he makes fun of the Irish while at the same time bragging [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=212.48s)]
*  about himself. Here was Joe Biden last year, for example, must be father from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  about to sin. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  I [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  well, I just want you to know I may be Irish, but I'm not stupid. I may be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=230.7s)]
*  Irish, but I'm not stupid. That was last year. This year, I may be Irish, but I'm [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=235.72s)]
*  not drunk and in jail. Joe Biden's been at this for a while. So the subtlety of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=240.48s)]
*  his insults is gone. But back in the day, Joe Biden was more clever. He found [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=245.17999999999998s)]
*  more inventive ways to slight his Irish guests on ST Patrick's Day back in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=250.76s)]
*  2010. For example, Biden memorialized the mother of Ireland's prime minister, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=255.28s)]
*  even though she was very much alive. The Taoiseach knows a lot about it. His [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  mom lived in Long Island for 10 years or so. God rest her soul. And although [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=264.6s)]
*  she's wait, your mom's still your mom's still alive as your dad passed. God [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  bless her soul. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=277.32000000000005s)]
*  I gotta get this straight. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a big one to not have straight. You can feel I mean, it's electric. Joe [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  Biden's enthusiasm for ST Patrick's Day in these videos. It's infectious, in fact, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  as Kamala Harris told us today. Joe Biden's love of this holiday is authentic. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=295.02s)]
*  And of course, no one is better to judge authenticity than Kamala Harris. Watch. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=300.58s)]
*  As you all know, Vice President Biden, this was one of his most particular joys [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=306.38s)]
*  as vice president. And as you all know, he is quite exuberant in that joy. And I [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=312.22s)]
*  now have caught the bug. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=318.62s)]
*  Joe Biden takes ST Patrick's Day seriously. I really can't talk. I use my [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=325.66s)]
*  hands a lot to talk. But how seriously does Joe Biden take ST Patrick's Day? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=330.54s)]
*  We can't confirm this. But there are reports tonight that Biden's famous [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=335.12s)]
*  showdown with corn pop resulted from Mr Pop not having the proper reverence for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=339.3s)]
*  ST Patrick's Day. He refused to wear green and Irish Joe had no choice but to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=344.54s)]
*  teach him a lesson. And corn pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=348.94s)]
*  He said, I'll be waiting for you. He was waiting for three guys in straight [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  racers. Not a joke. And he cut off a six foot length of chain. He fold up. He [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=358.70000000000005s)]
*  said, you walk out with that chain and you walked in the car and say, you may [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=363.18s)]
*  cut me, man, but I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head. That truly is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=367.94s)]
*  one of the greatest hits of politics. That clip never gets old. It is solid [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=372.94s)]
*  gold. Now again, we cannot be sure that corn pop had offended Joe Biden's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=378.1s)]
*  Irish, Puerto Rican, Greek, Polish, Italian ancestry. But it's starting to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=383.18s)]
*  look like the most likely theory. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbF8m3ushus&t=388.02s)]
