# Glenn Greenwald exposes Big Tech on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI)
*  So at exactly the moment when you need more information, not less less lying not more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=0.0s)]
*  Big-tech has aligned with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Intel agencies to curate everything you learn about the war being fought in your name in Ukraine and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=8.32s)]
*  Censor anyone who disagrees with them and the censorship is increasing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=15.44s)]
*  Senator Mark Warner has called on his donors in the tech monopolies to censor pro-russia social media posts and they oblige including by [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=18.76s)]
*  Americans by the way, and they get to decide what pro-russia is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=25.68s)]
*  Meanwhile the television network Russia today, which is Russia state media is being censored all over the world [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=28.92s)]
*  It's not an endorsement of Russia today to note [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=34.92s)]
*  It might be interesting to know what the other side is saying it might be good to have more information not less [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=37.64s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald has been making this point for a long time. He's an independent journalist. We're happy to have him join us tonight [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=44.16s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on the censorship seems very open [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=49.68s)]
*  Without apology and it seems more widespread than maybe I've ever seen it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=54.12s)]
*  Definitely without any precedent that I can remember as well [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=60.8s)]
*  I mean you'll probably recall in the days after 9-eleven Bill Maher [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=64.18s)]
*  When he was at ABC was fired because he said that he doesn't think the 9-eleven hijackers should be regarded as [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=67.6s)]
*  Cowards that whatever else you want to say about them [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=73.6s)]
*  It's evil [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=75.68s)]
*  But it takes courage to fly a plane into a building and end your life for a cause and there was a lot of sense even [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=76.2s)]
*  When we were attacked and the immediate aftermath that maybe it's not a good a good idea for people to just be fired [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=81.8s)]
*  Because it all create this atmosphere where no one can speak. It's so much worse [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=87.84s)]
*  I think one of the things that's gotten overlooked when we talk about big tech is how closely aligned they are to the US security state [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  They have huge contracts the Pentagon the CIA [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=97.44s)]
*  For cloud services for all kinds of other services and so often their censorship is purely aligned with US foreign policy in a way [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=99.88s)]
*  I think it's quite odious [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=107.0s)]
*  There used to be that and you grew up in the United States as I did were roughly the same age there was a sense [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=108.8s)]
*  When we were kids that were Americans we can read whatever we want [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=113.92s)]
*  They had banned books week at libraries where librarians fought back against censorship, which didn't really exist when we were kids [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=117.2s)]
*  What about that idea that as an American citizen you have a right to read whatever the hell you want back off [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=122.96s)]
*  What where is that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=128.48s)]
*  Yeah, so just did for the record I'm significantly younger than you both I accept that we're in the same [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=131.8s)]
*  General generational [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=136.83999999999997s)]
*  I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=138.64s)]
*  Mean I wonder that because you know one of the first articles [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  I ever wrote after I got into journalism was when the British historian David Irving was criminally convicted in Austria for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  teaching things about the Holocaust that were prohibited namely denialism and I wrote an article about how all Americans [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Instinctively recoil from that because we just have embedded within us the view that government shouldn't be dictating what we can and can't hear what we can [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=157.16s)]
*  and can't say [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=164.76s)]
*  15 years later Tucker there's almost there's very little of that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Ethos certainly not as a consensus and I'm so grateful for the First Amendment because without it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=170.6s)]
*  I'm certain that we would have all kinds of laws being enacted [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  Empowering the state not just to ban ideas but to criminalize them as well [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=178.72s)]
*  Well, you'd be in prison like you would have you'd be in I mean we'd be we'd be bringing you, you know extra underarm deodorant [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=182.72s)]
*  Yeah, it right without the first minute, but it seems like they're getting around it by just employing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=188.6s)]
*  Their effectively their agents in the tech monopolies to crush free speech [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  One of the things that I think has been very [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=201.68s)]
*  undernoticed is that for the past 18 months with the Democrats with their control in both houses of Congress have repeatedly summoned [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  tech executives to Congress and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=211.44s)]
*  explicitly said to them if you don't start censoring more the way we're telling you to you will suffer legal and regulatory [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=214.2s)]
*  Reprisals and there's Supreme Court rulings that say that of course the First Amendment bans the government from directly censoring [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=221.2s)]
*  But it also bans the government from pressuring or coercing private actors to censor on their behalf in the way the Constitution [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=227.76s)]
*  Prohibit and that's exactly what's been happening and still is happening ever more. So with this war [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=235.64s)]
*  It's horrifying and you have been one of the voices fighting back against it. We're grateful for that Glenn Greenwald. Appreciate it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=240.64s)]
*  Good boy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngVfwuz8oI&t=247.64s)]
