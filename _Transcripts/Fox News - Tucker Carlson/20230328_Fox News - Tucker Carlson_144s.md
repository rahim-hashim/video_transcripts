# Tucker: Never thought we'd be in this position
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs)
*  Glenn Greenwald has been following all of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=0.0s)]
*  He's host of System Update on Rumble, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=2.64s)]
*  and he joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=4.72s)]
*  Glenn, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=6.24s)]
*  Never thought that we would be in this position. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=9.24s)]
*  We've criticized TikTok pretty consistently [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=11.28s)]
*  for a number of years now, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  and certainly the government of China. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  But this does seem like an effort [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=16.0s)]
*  to make us more like China, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=17.56s)]
*  not an effort to push back against China. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=19.76s)]
*  There's so many ironies here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=23.68s)]
*  First of all, it's kind of astonishing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=25.04s)]
*  I've watched the Republican Party [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=26.76s)]
*  over the last two or three years [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=28.2s)]
*  with my support be very concerned, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=29.64s)]
*  increasingly so, about the ability [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=32.04s)]
*  of the US government to control [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=33.92s)]
*  what it is that we hear and see [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=36.04s)]
*  and can do on the internet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=37.96s)]
*  That's what the Twitter files were about. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=39.2s)]
*  That's what all kinds of controversies were about [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=40.8s)]
*  concerning the 2016 and 2020 election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=43.4s)]
*  And now the Republican Party, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=46.08s)]
*  along with the Democratic Party, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=47.56s)]
*  wants to give to the Biden administration [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=48.96s)]
*  an extraordinary power, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=51.08s)]
*  which is to ban social media platforms [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  that Americans are choosing to use. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  150 million Americans choose to use TikTok. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=58.92s)]
*  Maybe we should educate them not to. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  No one's forcing them to. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=64.08s)]
*  Some are children. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Many are adults. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=66.4s)]
*  You showed some of those. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=67.28s)]
*  That is an extraordinary power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=68.68s)]
*  And what is really ironic about it as well [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=70.88s)]
*  is that for years, China and Iran and Russia [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  were accused of being despotic [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=77.48s)]
*  because they wanted to ban Google and Facebook [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=79.68s)]
*  and other US tech companies [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=82.64s)]
*  and did so based on many of these same claims. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=84.2s)]
*  Those companies are really just propagandizing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  our citizenry. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=90.88s)]
*  They're corrupting our country and destabilizing us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=91.88s)]
*  They're spying on us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=94.2s)]
*  And so, as you say, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=95.6s)]
*  in the name of warding off China and fighting China, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=97.36s)]
*  the government is now about to embrace powers [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=101.04s)]
*  that the Chinese government itself has long wielded [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=104.04s)]
*  to control the flow of information in their countries. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=107.28s)]
*  And at the very least, I think we ought to think about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=110.36s)]
*  why this is happening. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=112.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think you may be one of the only people saying this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=115.36s)]
*  who's not taking money from China in order to say it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=117.8s)]
*  And one of the reasons we're so grateful that you came on [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=120.44s)]
*  is because we know that you are speaking in good faith [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=122.16s)]
*  and it's worth considering. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=125.36s)]
*  And thank you for raising these questions for us tonight. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=126.56s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, a great man. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV53vkqogs&t=132.48s)]
