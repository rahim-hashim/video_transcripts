# Tulsi Gabbard: This Biden official just 'exposed' the administration
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg)
*  So here's a story that's been kind of forgotten, but Toria Nuland, who was the driving force behind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=0.0s)]
*  the war in Ukraine, helped start the war in Ukraine, in January threatened to blow up the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=4.64s)]
*  Nord Stream pipelines so that Russia couldn't send gas to Europe. Remember this? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=8.64s)]
*  I want to be clear with you today. If Russia invades Ukraine, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=14.16s)]
*  one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=18.96s)]
*  So then in September, somebody blew up the pipelines, and that was the biggest man-made [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=23.919999999999998s)]
*  environmental disaster in history. If you're worried about climate change, you should be in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=29.2s)]
*  tears because of the amount of carbon that emitted into the atmosphere. So it was pretty obvious to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=32.56s)]
*  us the Biden administration was involved in this. We said that and we were immediately denounced [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  by the entire left and the entire media as agents of Putin. Why are they doing that? And by the way, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=42.32s)]
*  when we actually join this war in force, what will they do to anyone who objects to it? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=47.68s)]
*  Ooh, they're going to punish people. You watch. But with this in mind, we were a little bit [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=52.16s)]
*  surprised to see Toria Nuland essentially admit last week that she did it. Watch this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=56.4s)]
*  Senator Cruz, like you, I am, and I think the administration is very gratified to know that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 is now, as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=69.92s)]
*  Well, she's excited about it. When it happened, they said, we're upset about it. We have no idea [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=74.96s)]
*  who did this. And if you think we had a hand in it, you're Putin. What are we watching here? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=78.96s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a former presidential candidate. She joins us tonight. Congresswoman, thank you so [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  much for coming on. So now they're basically admitting it and nobody is saying anything. Why? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  I think there's two really important things for the American people to take away from what you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  have just outlined here. Number one is that statement from Victoria Nuland just exposed her [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=100.16s)]
*  and the administration's truth, which is that they have been lying to us all along about this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=105.84s)]
*  There's no way the United States was not either involved or knew about this or, at the very minimum, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=110.56s)]
*  approved it. So they've been lying to us. They've been deceiving us saying, hey, look, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=117.04s)]
*  the United States had absolutely nothing to do with this, while also trying to sell us the absurd [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=121.04s)]
*  lie that, well, of course, Russia somehow bombed their own, exploded their own energy infrastructure [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=126.4s)]
*  to hurt their own economic interests. It just shows how stupid they think we are that we would buy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=133.2s)]
*  such an absurd argument. Their lying to us shows us yet again that we can't trust anything that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  they're saying. We can't trust any of these narratives that are coming out of the mainstream [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=144.64s)]
*  media. The second thing that's important to recognize that is very dangerous is that they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  are setting a precedent through what her statements are and their actions that now that it is acceptable [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  to go and essentially use sabotage against infrastructure as an acceptable strategy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=158.88s)]
*  We have to look at our own vulnerabilities in this area, whether it's the undersea cables, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=165.92s)]
*  our communication systems, our financial systems, our own power grid and energy system [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=170.0s)]
*  vulnerabilities. The list goes on and on. The argument is very clear. Hey, look, if it's OK [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=174.96s)]
*  to go after and bomb and destroy Russia's oil and gas infrastructure, why would it not then be OK [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=180.64s)]
*  for someone else to come and attack our own, exploit our own vulnerabilities here? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=187.28s)]
*  So this is the position that the warmongers in Washington have put us into, we the American [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=192.4s)]
*  people, all in the name of saying, hey, we're doing this to protect you. We're trying to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=197.44s)]
*  protect democracy, but their actions are making us less safe and undermining our democracy because [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=200.08s)]
*  we cannot have a functioning democracy if we can't trust what our leaders are telling us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=207.36s)]
*  Well, and they don't care about democracy at all. But mark my word. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=212.8s)]
*  No. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=215.92s)]
*  Anyone who calls them out on their lies have already denounced you, for example, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=216.48s)]
*  as a disloyal American who serves her country in uniform. If this war accelerates, they will go [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=220.24s)]
*  after you and everyone else who's called them on their lies. That's where it's up to the American [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=225.92s)]
*  people. Where is their hope? The hope lies in our hands to fire, get rid of these, throw these [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=232.0s)]
*  lying warmongering politicians out of office and stop listening to the crap the mainstream media [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=239.6s)]
*  and big tech is putting out and take a stand for the truth for our country and for our security and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=244.0s)]
*  freedom. Amen. Tulsi Gabbard, great to see you tonight. Thank you. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnIFvOqDmg&t=248.88s)]
