# Tucker Carlson: It's hard to believe this is happening
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI)
*  First, there's other news we wanted to get to, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=0.0s)]
*  and that includes an update [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=1.68s)]
*  on the Biden administration's armed crackdown [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=2.84s)]
*  on its critics. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=5.08s)]
*  Earlier this month, a longtime FBI agent [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=6.48s)]
*  and SWAT team veteran called Steve Friend [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=8.44s)]
*  came forward to blow the whistle [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  on what he has seen happen to the FBI under Joe Biden, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=12.44s)]
*  and what he said was shocking. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=15.6s)]
*  According to Agent Friend, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=17.32s)]
*  Biden's FBI routinely uses heavily armed SWAT teams [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=18.44s)]
*  to raid the homes of American citizens [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=22.32s)]
*  who dare to criticize the administration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=24.32s)]
*  Now, to be clear, these are people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=26.36s)]
*  who pose no danger to anyone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=27.96s)]
*  These are people who haven't even been accused, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  much less convicted of a violent crime. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  So the point is not to bring justice, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  the point is to terrify and intimidate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=36.68s)]
*  Joe Biden's political opponents. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=38.52s)]
*  Hard to believe that's happening, but it is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=40.92s)]
*  Last year, to name just one example, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=43.28s)]
*  the FBI's Counterterrorism Division [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  raided the home of a 69-year-old Red Cross volunteer [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  called Joseph Bilanos. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=50.44s)]
*  An anonymous snitch had claimed that Bilanos [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=52.32000000000001s)]
*  was at the Capitol on January 6th, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  not that he did anything violent, but that he was there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=56.6s)]
*  It turns out that wasn't even true, it was a lie. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  But the feds moved forward [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=62.2s)]
*  and destroyed Bilanos' life anyway. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=63.32s)]
*  They showed up with guns, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=65.4s)]
*  they stole his electronic devices, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=66.68s)]
*  and they refused to return them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=68.2s)]
*  The whole experience was so traumatic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=70.2s)]
*  that Joseph Bilanos suffered two strokes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=71.68s)]
*  Well, on September 19th, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  the FBI suspended Agent Steve Friend [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=76.72s)]
*  for daring to reveal what was happening, these abuses. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=79.2s)]
*  Now, it's illegal under federal law [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=82.4s)]
*  to punish whistleblowers, but the FBI did it anyway. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  And then, four days later, with Friend out of the way, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  on the morning of September 23rd, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  a team of nearly 30 FBI agents [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  bristling with automatic weapons [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=94.2s)]
*  raided the home of yet another harmless man [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=96.12s)]
*  with no criminal record. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=98.64s)]
*  That man's name was Mark Hauck. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=100.16s)]
*  Hauck is 47, he's a leader in his local Catholic community. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=102.04s)]
*  FBI agents pointed rifles at Hauck [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=105.44s)]
*  and his wife in front of their seven children. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=107.76s)]
*  Once again, to be clear, Hauck is not a terrorist, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  he's never been accused of terrorism, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=115.08s)]
*  he is instead a pro-lifer. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=117.08s)]
*  Hauck founded an organization called The King's Men, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=119.2s)]
*  it's a pro-life group that encourages men [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=121.56s)]
*  to be leaders in their communities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=123.28s)]
*  Now, to give you a sense of who Hauck is, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=125.72s)]
*  we want to play this for you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=127.12s)]
*  Here he is describing the experience he had [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=128.52s)]
*  earlier this year praying outside [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=131.28s)]
*  in an abortion clinic with his son. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=132.72s)]
*  A woman came out who had an abortion, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=135.48s)]
*  and we offered her some post-abortion healing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=138.76s)]
*  Well, we just said, we'll pray for you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=142.76s)]
*  And as we were praying the sorrowful mysteries, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=144.72s)]
*  I brought my son over, I said, come on, let's kneel down, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  we're gonna do this, then we're gonna leave. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=151.16s)]
*  She got into it, she started attacking us personally, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=152.68s)]
*  while we were praying the sorrowful mysteries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=157.16s)]
*  I said, son, this is what the Lord's talking about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=159.28s)]
*  when he said, they hated me, they're gonna hate you, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=162.48s)]
*  they persecuted me, they're gonna, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  I whispered this to him as she was spewing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=167.32s)]
*  all this vulgarity onto him and me. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=169.92s)]
*  And I just told him, this is what it's gonna take, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=172.76s)]
*  this is what we have to do, this is part of the journey. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  So that's Mark Hauck. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=179.64s)]
*  Now, he's a religious man, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=181.0s)]
*  not everyone is a religious person, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=182.48s)]
*  not everyone agrees with Mark Hauck, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  but there's no doubt that Mark Hauck is a peaceful, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=186.44s)]
*  is a non-violent person. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=189.64s)]
*  In October of last year, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=192.0s)]
*  Hauck was standing outside another abortion clinic [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=193.04s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, he was joined again by his 12-year-old son. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  That's when a man approached and began harassing the boy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=198.12s)]
*  So defend his son, Hauck pushed the extremist back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=201.8s)]
*  That was it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=205.96s)]
*  Local police looked into it, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=207.12s)]
*  the district attorney's office looked into it, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=208.28s)]
*  nobody pressed charges against Mark Hauck [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=210.12s)]
*  because it's not assault to protect your son [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  from an extremist who's attacking him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=215.44s)]
*  But the Biden Justice Department [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=218.44s)]
*  decided to revise this view, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=219.96s)]
*  and they charged Mark Hauck with a federal crime, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=222.4s)]
*  a felony obstructing abortion access. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  There was no evidence that he had obstructed abortion access, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  but that's what they charged him with. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=230.64s)]
*  Now, Hauck learned about three months ago [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=232.48s)]
*  that the DOJ planned to charge him, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  and he offered to turn himself in voluntarily. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=236.48s)]
*  That's what a civilized country allows. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=239.48s)]
*  But that wasn't good enough for Merrick Garland's DOJ, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  they wanted to punish him and terrify his family [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=245.0s)]
*  to send the right message to anyone [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  who would dare get in the way of the Biden agenda. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  So the DOJ sent a team of federal agents [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  with rifles to Hauck's home. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  He now faces 11 years in prison for protecting his son. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=256.24s)]
*  Now, again, it's hard to believe that any of that actually happened, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=261.88s)]
*  but it actually did. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=264.24s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyY1BlSPuI&t=265.68s)]
