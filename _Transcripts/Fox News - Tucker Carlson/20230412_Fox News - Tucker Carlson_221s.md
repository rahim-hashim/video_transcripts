# Tucker asks Trump who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I)
*  So the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=0.0s)]
*  the natural gas pipeline that carried, well, natural gas [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=2.2s)]
*  from East to Western Europe was the single most profound act [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=5.2s)]
*  of environmental terrorism in history. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=9.48s)]
*  It released more deadly CO2 into the atmosphere. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=11.76s)]
*  It was also an attack on our NATO allies. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=14.44s)]
*  Our NATO allies were the beneficiaries [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  of the natural gas pipeline. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=19.8s)]
*  Germany, which is the core of European NATO, suffered. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=20.92s)]
*  So the Biden administration was talking about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  how much it loves NATO, attacked NATO, and they did it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=25.84s)]
*  They promised to carry it out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=28.48s)]
*  They haven't really denied that they did it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=30.48s)]
*  So during an interview with Donald Trump yesterday, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=32.32s)]
*  we thought we'd ask, who does he think did it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=34.0s)]
*  We previewed the answer last night. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=36.56s)]
*  Here's the full exchange. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=38.24s)]
*  Who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=41.04s)]
*  I don't want to get our country in trouble, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=45.2s)]
*  so I won't answer it, but I can tell you [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=47.24s)]
*  who it wasn't was Russia. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  How about when they blamed Russia? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=53.36s)]
*  You know, they said Russia blew up their own pipeline. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=54.56s)]
*  You got to kick out of that one, too. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=57.72s)]
*  It wasn't Russia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=59.92s)]
*  So I won't answer the question only [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=62.72s)]
*  because I don't want to get our country [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=64.44s)]
*  any deeper than they already are, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=66.32s)]
*  but it sort of all starts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=69.08s)]
*  We have the most incredible equipment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=70.88s)]
*  I rebuilt our whole military. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=74.2s)]
*  We have things that are, you can do anything. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=76.56s)]
*  We're equipped to do anything, but I refuse to say it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=80.6s)]
*  because I want our country to be pristine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=83.84s)]
*  But it was, you know, in many ways, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=87.64s)]
*  blowing it up was very bad because it really created [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  a lot of problems for Europe in terms of the cost of energy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=93.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  But they shouldn't have ever been, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  I had that pipeline stop, Nord Stream 2, I had it stop. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=100.0s)]
*  Totally stopped. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=102.64s)]
*  When Biden came in, he approved it, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=103.8s)]
*  and they immediately started the finishing action. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=106.36s)]
*  I had Nord Stream because I said, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=109.72s)]
*  for Germany and Europe to get their energy from Russia, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=111.36s)]
*  that was when I said I sent Angela Merkel, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=115.0s)]
*  the flag, I sent her the white flag of surrender. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=117.72s)]
*  She said, but why, but why do you do that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  I said, you've been fighting Russia for many years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  If you ever have to fight with Russia, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=126.88s)]
*  and they control energy, you might as well [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=129.28s)]
*  just take the white flag of surrender, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  and that's what I did. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  So that was blown up, and very dangerous to do it, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=133.68s)]
*  but I think most people know who did it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=140.04s)]
*  So once we start blowing up other people's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=142.0s)]
*  critical infrastructures, they're a concern. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=144.04s)]
*  Ours could get blown up in return. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=145.8s)]
*  Well, I think it's much more than infrastructure [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  you're talking about. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  Look, we could end up in World War III [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  over this whole thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=152.56s)]
*  Forget about pipeline. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  We are closer, I believe it's the most dangerous period [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=155.8s)]
*  of time in history. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  Number one, because we have people on top [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=162.12s)]
*  that are incompetent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=166.56s)]
*  And again, China's fine if you know how to deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Russia, if you know how to deal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Russia wasn't going into Ukraine with me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=174.4s)]
*  China wasn't going into Taiwan with me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=176.68s)]
*  I mean, now all you see is China with ships [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=179.84s)]
*  all over the place and sending airplanes and bombers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=182.32s)]
*  That wasn't happening with me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=185.6s)]
*  He knew you can't do it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=186.8s)]
*  And also, Russia knew you can't do it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=189.44s)]
*  They would have never done it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=192.28s)]
*  The most dangerous period of time, because of weaponry, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=194.56s)]
*  because of nuclear, because of weaponry, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=198.44s)]
*  most dangerous period of time in the history [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  of our country and in the history of the world right now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=203.92s)]
*  And we have an incompetent person at the top. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktEFFrtq5I&t=207.2s)]
