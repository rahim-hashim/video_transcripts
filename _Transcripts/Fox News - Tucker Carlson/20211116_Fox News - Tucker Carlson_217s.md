# Tucker: Leaders don't think you need stuff
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE)
*  This isn't esoteric. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=0.0s)]
*  This isn't some gigantic bill it is, but it's about what happens to ordinary people. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=3.06s)]
*  Conversations around those kitchen tables that are both profound as they are ordinary. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=8.9s)]
*  How do I cross a bridge in a snowstorm? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=13.24s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=15.84s)]
*  No, I'm, think about it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=16.84s)]
*  You know, you're in a situation, what happens if the bridge collapses and there's a fire [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=18.28s)]
*  on the other side? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=21.3s)]
*  It's going to take 10 miles longer to get to the fire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=22.8s)]
*  People can die. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is real. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  This is real stuff. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=28.58s)]
*  That's your president indulging his first love for slam poetry doing his avant-garde [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=31.52s)]
*  freestyle spoken word routine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  How do I cross a bridge in a snowstorm? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=37.5s)]
*  What happens if the bridge collapses and there's a fire on the other side? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=39.48s)]
*  Tiger, tiger burning bright in the forest of the night. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=42.5s)]
*  What immortal hand or eye has framed thy fearful symmetry? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=45.3s)]
*  Applause breaks out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=48.62s)]
*  Brilliant! [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=49.62s)]
*  But what does it mean exactly? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=50.62s)]
*  Someday we'll understand. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=52.82s)]
*  For now, we don't deserve to know. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=53.82s)]
*  We can be certain of one thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=55.54s)]
*  A trillion dollars of newly printed money for, quote, infrastructure is a very good [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=57.18s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=61.26s)]
*  Come on, man, it's good. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=62.26s)]
*  That's what our president is telling us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  The downside, of course, is that inflation is about to make you a lot poorer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=65.02s)]
*  Inflation is what happens when a government devalues its own currency, something the Biden [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=69.88s)]
*  administration is doing at a faster rate than at any time in American history. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=74.3s)]
*  Net result? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=77.98s)]
*  You may make more money, but you can't afford the staples you used to buy because suddenly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=78.98s)]
*  everything is much more expensive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  Think of it as an ever accelerating treadmill. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  In the end, inevitably, you wind up in a heap on the ground. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  But don't worry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=93.18s)]
*  It may be painful, but it's going to be good for you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=95.34s)]
*  It turns out you are too rich as it is. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=98.66000000000001s)]
*  You are weak and decadent and flabby. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=101.54s)]
*  You've had it too easy, Mr. and Mrs. America. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=104.54s)]
*  Why can't you be more like our Guatemalan grounds crew and quag, grateful and uncomplaining [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  and non-English speaking? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=111.52s)]
*  Well, that's the new message from CNBC, which has taken a momentary break from committing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=113.36s)]
*  unnatural sex acts on technology CEOs to lecture the American middle class about their undeserved [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=118.52s)]
*  affluence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=124.08s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=125.08s)]
*  The dirty little secret here, Willie. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=126.08s)]
*  While nobody likes to pay more, on average, we have the money to do so. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Household savings hit a record high over the pandemic. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=134.88s)]
*  We didn't really have anywhere to go out and spend. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=137.6s)]
*  So the dirty little secret is, thanks to Joe Biden, you can afford inflation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=142.48s)]
*  So shut up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=149.48s)]
*  MSNBC agrees with that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Why the inflation we're seeing now is a good thing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=153.56s)]
*  They ran that headline recently. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=156.76s)]
*  And then according to Bloomberg News, as inflation rises, Americans, quote, may need to gasp, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=158.04s)]
*  live more like the Europeans that actually might not be a bad thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=163.68s)]
*  Got it? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=168.72s)]
*  So you're no longer going to have enough money to drive your own car, but honestly, middle [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=169.72s)]
*  America, that might not be a bad thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=173.28s)]
*  You're going to love living like a Romanian. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  It's fun to have less food. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=179.16s)]
*  They're literally saying these things out loud, just like Louis XVI did and his wife, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  just like the Romanovs, just like Batista. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=188.08s)]
*  What is it about decadent ruling classes that they always double down just as the grotesque [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=191.08s)]
*  and unfair systems they've created start to topple? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  They never see it coming. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  It's almost like they're stupid. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-338XL1wXE&t=202.56s)]
