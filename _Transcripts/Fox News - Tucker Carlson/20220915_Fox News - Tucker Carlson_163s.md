# Chicago reporter suing Mayor Lightfoot for pulling press credentials after asking hard questions
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0)
*  This reporter asks real questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=0.0s)]
*  William Kelly joins us tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  It's wonderful to be with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=7.76s)]
*  This is a textbook First Amendment case. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=9.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, the textbook is from Venezuela. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=12.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=15.76s)]
*  No, it looks, it looks that, I mean, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=16.92s)]
*  are we missing something? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you are, your credentials were revoked [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=19.88s)]
*  because you asked the most obvious possible question, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=22.32s)]
*  our city's falling apart, what are you gonna do? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=25.16s)]
*  And then no longer allowed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=26.76s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=28.32s)]
*  I believe that journalism is extremely important. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=29.32s)]
*  I've had a media credential in Chicago for over 10 years, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=31.64s)]
*  Emmy award-winning, print, radio, TV, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=34.72s)]
*  but Mayor Lightfoot is the least transparent mayor [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=38.6s)]
*  in our city's history. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=41.92s)]
*  And sadly, my, for better or for worse, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=43.44s)]
*  the reason my questions were so effective [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=48.44s)]
*  is because I was asking the questions [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=50.44s)]
*  that real Chicagoans wanted to hear, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=52.04s)]
*  but they were hurting her reelection campaigns [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=54.72s)]
*  so she canceled my media credential. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=57.12s)]
*  I think the real scandal here, Tucker, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=58.84s)]
*  is that the Mayor Lightfoot has 80 plus security guards [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=61.8s)]
*  that are assigned to protect her from me [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=65.68s)]
*  asking her questions during a reelection campaign. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=68.68s)]
*  At a time when the Chicago police are down 1,500 officers, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=71.92s)]
*  crime is out of control, there's record low arrests [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=77.44s)]
*  and a spike in police suicides. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=82.44s)]
*  It's my prayer that a federal judge [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=85.28s)]
*  will restore my media credential tomorrow [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=86.96s)]
*  so I can go back to Chicago City Hall [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=89.88s)]
*  and ask about the spike in police suicide, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=92.08s)]
*  which is such a tragedy that's facing our city right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=95.6s)]
*  I mean, this is obvious censorship. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=99.88s)]
*  Really quick, have other media organizations, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=101.84s)]
*  Chicago Tribune, for example, have they filed complaints [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=103.72s)]
*  with the mayor's office on your behalf? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=106.88s)]
*  Have they stood with you in solidarity? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=108.4s)]
*  I think that this has had a chilling effect [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=110.96s)]
*  on all reporters. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=112.84s)]
*  They see that I asked real questions [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=113.68s)]
*  and I got my credential revoked, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=117.04s)]
*  canceled, I guess would be a better word. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  I grew up in Chicago watching legendary reporters, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Pam Zekman, John Bulldog, Drummond, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=127.12s)]
*  chasing politicians up and down the street, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=129.24s)]
*  And this is the tradition I want to uphold. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=133.32s)]
*  This is the Chicago reporter tradition [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=137.44s)]
*  that Lightfoot wants to cancel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=140.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Mike Royko would be so ashamed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=143.12s)]
*  of what's happened to your city and its media. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=147.56s)]
*  Mr. Kelly, thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggueTeYgH0&t=150.48s)]
