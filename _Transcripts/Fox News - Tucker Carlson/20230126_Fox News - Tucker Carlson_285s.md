# Tucker: This is nuts and no one seems to care
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8)
*  It's Zelensky's 45th birthday today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=0.0s)]
*  He's getting a huge president. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=2.16s)]
*  Ukraine is about to receive more than 30 M1 Abrams tanks [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  from the U.S. military. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  That's a whole battalion [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=8.76s)]
*  of our most technologically advanced tank tanks [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=9.92s)]
*  we said we would never send to Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Now we are. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=14.84s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=15.66s)]
*  Today, I'm announcing that the United States [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=17.16s)]
*  will be sending 31 Abram tanks to Ukraine, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=19.88s)]
*  the equivalent of one Ukrainian battalion. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=23.2s)]
*  Secretary Austin has recommended this step [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=25.84s)]
*  because it will enhance the Ukraine's capacity [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=28.88s)]
*  to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  So Germany, Poland, and the UK [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=36.72s)]
*  are also sending tanks to Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=38.2s)]
*  So what was going on here? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=41.72s)]
*  Well, in a meeting of the Council of Europe yesterday, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=43.16s)]
*  Germany's foreign minister casually mentioned [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=45.72s)]
*  that NATO has in effect declared war on Russia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Here's Annalena Baerbach [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=51.16s)]
*  explaining that World War III is already underway. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=53.36s)]
*  I've said already in the last days, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  yes, we have to do more to defend Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=59.24s)]
*  Yes, we have to do more also on tanks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  But the most important and the crucial part [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=64.92s)]
*  is that we do it together [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=67.64s)]
*  and that we do not do the blame game in Europe [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=69.92s)]
*  because we are fighting a war against Russia [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=73.8s)]
*  and not against each other. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  She's in charge. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=81.6s)]
*  Now you hate to go with cheap historical analogies, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=82.92s)]
*  but since this conflict has been framed since day one [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=84.92s)]
*  by our idiot class as a replay of World War II, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=87.12s)]
*  it is fair to point out it's been a long time [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  since the Germans sent tanks into Ukraine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=91.86s)]
*  Didn't work well last time, probably won't this time either. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=93.92s)]
*  But that's what NATO is planning apparently, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=96.54s)]
*  as numerous Biden officials have said in recent weeks, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=98.62s)]
*  the goal is to take back Crimea. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  Now wait a second. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=103.72s)]
*  At the beginning they said, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=104.92s)]
*  let's just push Russia back to pre-February 2022 borders. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  That seemed kind of reasonable to most people, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  including us, but taking Russian Crimea from Russia, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=111.0s)]
*  its essential port, well Russia has said many times [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=117.0s)]
*  and there's every reason to believe them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=120.6s)]
*  that would lead to nuclear war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=121.76s)]
*  But that's the new plan? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=123.76s)]
*  Was this voted on? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=124.88s)]
*  That's truly crazy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=126.0s)]
*  And to do it, we're enlisting [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=128.56s)]
*  one of the most corrupt governments in the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=129.84s)]
*  Several senior officials in Ukraine, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=131.76s)]
*  including the Deputy Defense Minister, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=133.32s)]
*  the top prosecutor have resigned [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=134.8s)]
*  because they were too corrupt even for Zelensky. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=136.84s)]
*  Now where'd all that money come from? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=139.28s)]
*  It's a country at war, it's been at war for almost a year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=141.18s)]
*  Well the money came from us [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=143.2s)]
*  because Congress has never audited the money, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=144.4s)]
*  the billions in your tax dollars sent to Ukraine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=146.8s)]
*  This is nuts, but no one in Washington seems to care. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=149.68s)]
*  Now we hate to pick on former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=152.74s)]
*  he's a nice enough guy, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=154.76s)]
*  but it's hard to resist responding to this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=156.38s)]
*  Here's Pompeo telling us that you have a moral obligation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=158.26s)]
*  to give Zelensky everything he wants. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=161.08s)]
*  We should be helping America. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=163.72s)]
*  And helping America means a sovereign nation [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=165.68s)]
*  that is prepared to defend itself [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=168.28s)]
*  from an invasion and an attack [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  where civilians are being killed by Vladimir Putin [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=171.28s)]
*  is in America's best interest for our economy, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=173.78s)]
*  for our security. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=175.94s)]
*  We should be doing everything [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=177.22s)]
*  the Ukrainians are asking us to do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=178.46s)]
*  Okay, we should do everything [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  the most corrupt government in Europe wants us to do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=183.26000000000002s)]
*  Everything, because that's good for America. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=185.18s)]
*  Really, that's the most important thing we can do for America? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=188.58s)]
*  We don't mean to beat up on poor Mike Pompeo. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=190.94s)]
*  But I mean, are you serious? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  What about the armies of drug zombies smoking fentanyl [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=196.06s)]
*  in every major city? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=198.84s)]
*  Should we do something like that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=199.74s)]
*  You're San Francisco right now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=201.5s)]
*  Hey, bro, put that sh** away, man. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=204.74s)]
*  You got kids walking out here, man. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=206.34s)]
*  Dude, really, you're shooting in your neck, bro? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=217.94s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=221.34s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=224.46s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=226.06s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=231.86s)]
*  Come on, man. There's kids around, man. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=233.38000000000002s)]
*  We shouldn't be doing that around here, bro. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=235.18s)]
*  Come on, man. You gotta do that somewhere else, man. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=237.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm serious, bro. You got to go do that somewhere else. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=239.74s)]
*  You right in front of a Starbucks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=241.9s)]
*  You right in front of a Starbucks, bro. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  Shooting up dope, bro. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  So again, if you had a to-do list of things to do for America, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=249.06s)]
*  that might rate higher [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=252.26000000000002s)]
*  than sending more money to Zelensky. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=254.58s)]
*  And you might also, since you were trying to help America, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  as Pompeo said, you might do something with the fact [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=258.86s)]
*  our southern border has been completely overrun [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=260.62s)]
*  by foreign nationals, millions of them [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=262.82s)]
*  shepherded through into our country [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=264.38s)]
*  with the Mexican drug cartels. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=265.62s)]
*  But that's not the most important thing in Washington. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=268.06s)]
*  The single most important thing we can do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=270.3s)]
*  is send Ukraine whatever it wants to take back Crimea. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJpnz1MOx8&t=272.18s)]
