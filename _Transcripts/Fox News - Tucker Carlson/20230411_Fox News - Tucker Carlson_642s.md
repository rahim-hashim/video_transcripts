# Donald Trump: They're 'weaponizing' our justice system
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI)
*  Mr. President, thank you for having us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=1.36s)]
*  Last week, you were in New York for the Surraignment. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=2.36s)]
*  The world watched it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=4.08s)]
*  You've not given an interview since. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=5.2s)]
*  You were there, I think, 57 minutes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=7.28s)]
*  Tell us from your perspective what that was like. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=9.44s)]
*  Well, it was a horrible thing, because I did nothing wrong. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=11.16s)]
*  Absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=14.92s)]
*  You look at even the pundits and the legal analysis, Greg Jarrett, all of these really [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=16.16s)]
*  talented people, they're saying, he didn't do anything wrong. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=21.04s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=24.6s)]
*  Number two, they were incredible. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=25.84s)]
*  When I went to the courthouse, which is also a prison, in a sense, they signed me in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=28.08s)]
*  And I'll tell you, people were crying, people that work there, professionally work there, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=35.48s)]
*  that have no problems putting in murderers, and they see everybody. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=39.4s)]
*  It's tough, tough place. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=43.4s)]
*  And they were crying. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  They were actually crying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  They said, I'm sorry. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=48.56s)]
*  They'd say, 2024, sir, 2024. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  And tears are pouring down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=54.04s)]
*  There was, I've never seen anything like the whole — [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=55.04s)]
*  Those people are phenomenal. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=57.68s)]
*  Those are your police. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=59.92s)]
*  Those are the people that work at the courthouse. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=62.0s)]
*  They're unbelievable people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=64.68s)]
*  Many of them were in tears or close to it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=67.6s)]
*  Many apologists were sorry, sir, were sorry. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=71.84s)]
*  They had to have me do certain things. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=74.6s)]
*  They said, sir, I can't believe I have to ask you — I can't even believe that I have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=76.92s)]
*  to ask you to do it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=81.2s)]
*  You could see. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  So, in one sense, it was beautiful because they get it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=83.92s)]
*  In another sense, you know, it's nasty. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  I went to the Wharton School of Finance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=89.32s)]
*  They didn't teach me about that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=90.92s)]
*  That wasn't — [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=92.32s)]
*  They didn't know about the arraignment part? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=93.32s)]
*  That wasn't — we didn't have a class on arraignment. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  And you know, it was a sad day in many ways, and in many ways, it was a beautiful day because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  the people understand — I didn't know this was happening, but the poll numbers have gone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=105.08s)]
*  through the roof. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  The people get it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=111.08s)]
*  And the other ones are hoaxes also. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  You know, the box hoax. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=113.76s)]
*  Look at Biden. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=114.76s)]
*  He's got 1,850 boxes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=115.76s)]
*  And you know, that's a hoax. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  And then the one in Atlanta where I had a perfect phone call. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=119.72s)]
*  This is all weaponization. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  They're weaponizing our justice system, Tucker. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  And they think if they go and give you a subpoena — you know, I guess I'm very well known, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=127.44s)]
*  and people understand it and they get it, and maybe I have a bigger platform so I can [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=132.12s)]
*  explain it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  But if you're somebody — a Republican, let's say, running for office, and you get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=137.08s)]
*  a subpoena, you might as well resign because you're not going to be able to survive it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  And the voters aren't going to handle it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=145.8s)]
*  The voters aren't going to take it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=147.44s)]
*  What they're doing is weaponizing the system, and there's never been anything like it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=149.08s)]
*  And it's all disinformation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=153.24s)]
*  You see, the other day, Afghanistan — one of the worst things I've ever seen, I think [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=154.52s)]
*  the most embarrassing moment that this country has ever had, frankly, the way we got out [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=159.72s)]
*  — not the getting out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=165.12s)]
*  We had to get out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=166.12s)]
*  It was ridiculous to be there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=167.12s)]
*  And I had that so good, so tight, so tough. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=169.04s)]
*  I spoke to the leader, Abdul. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=172.04s)]
*  I said, Abdul, if you do anything, you're going to get hit really hard. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Literally, I even — he said, but sir, why? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=180.76s)]
*  He goes, why oh why do you send me a picture of my house? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=181.76s)]
*  I said, you have to figure that one out, Abdul. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  But we didn't have one death in 18 months. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=188.12s)]
*  He knew. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Not one death. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=192.12s)]
*  And then to see the way we got out, like we were surrendering, like taking the military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=193.12s)]
*  out first, leaving $85 billion worth of equipment behind, giving up Bagram. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  I was going to keep Bagram. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=202.36s)]
*  I was getting out, but not for Afghanistan. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=203.36s)]
*  It's one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=206.08s)]
*  It's one of the biggest Air Force bases in the world, I think the biggest, with runways [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=210.36s)]
*  that go 10,000 feet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=214.28000000000003s)]
*  I was keeping that because of China, not because of Afghanistan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=215.56s)]
*  And they left everything. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  They left in the dark of night. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=222.52s)]
*  They left the lights on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=223.96s)]
*  They left the dogs, by the way. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=225.0s)]
*  They left the dogs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  They left the dogs. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=228.16s)]
*  Everyone, you know, the dog lovers, and you got a lot of them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=229.16s)]
*  I love dogs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=231.2s)]
*  You love dogs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=232.2s)]
*  But they left the dogs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=233.32s)]
*  People said, what, one of the first questions I got, what did they do with the dogs? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=234.32s)]
*  Mostly German shepherds. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=237.84s)]
*  They left them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=239.48s)]
*  What they did, the way they got out was so horrible. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=244.04s)]
*  Everybody knows that was their plan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=245.04s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=246.88s)]
*  I was getting out too. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=247.92s)]
*  We would have gotten out with strength and dignity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=248.92s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=252.04s)]
*  They got out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=253.72s)]
*  The other day, I hear, yeah, it was Trump's fault. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=254.76s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=258.88s)]
*  It was Trump's fault. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=259.88s)]
*  I was gone for a long time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=261.52s)]
*  I would have been out faster than them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=262.68s)]
*  We would have had all the equipment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=264.4s)]
*  We would have had the American citizens. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=266.08s)]
*  We left hostages. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=268.28s)]
*  We left Americans behind. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=269.38s)]
*  Many, I think many more than you think. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=270.64s)]
*  And we had 13 soldiers killed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=273.84s)]
*  And nobody ever mentions the fact that we had many maimed so badly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=276.0s)]
*  No arms, no legs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=280.6s)]
*  Their face was obliterated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=281.8s)]
*  This is the way this guy got out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=284.6s)]
*  We would have gotten out with dignity and strength. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=286.22s)]
*  We were going to. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  But I was taking 100 percent of, I said, I want every nail. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  I want every screw. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=293.04s)]
*  I want the tents. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=294.88s)]
*  They said, sir, the tents are very hard to take out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=295.88s)]
*  I said, I want the tents. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=298.24s)]
*  I want the tanks. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=299.72s)]
*  I want the planes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=300.88s)]
*  I want everything. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=301.88s)]
*  And a couple of them fought me on it, like Milley. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=302.88s)]
*  He said, sir, I think it's cheaper to leave the equipment behind. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  I said, let me ask you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  We have a plane that cost $100 million. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  It's sitting there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  It needs us a tank of gas. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=313.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=314.67999999999995s)]
*  Give me a little jet fuel. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll fly it to Pakistan or any place else, or we'll fly it directly home. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=317.28s)]
*  You say it's cheaper to leave a $100 million plane. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=322.11999999999995s)]
*  Sure, I think overall it's cheaper. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=324.56s)]
*  These are idiots we're dealing with. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=327.44s)]
*  They left $85 billion worth of equipment. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=329.44s)]
*  They left our American citizens behind. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=332.38s)]
*  And they moved the military out first. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=335.12s)]
*  No, you moved the military out last. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=336.32s)]
*  I did a little skit with a five-year-old kid. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=338.4s)]
*  I said, let me ask you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=340.55999999999995s)]
*  This is a situation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=342.16s)]
*  I explained the situation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=343.16s)]
*  I said, would you take the military out first, or would you take it out last? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=344.16s)]
*  I took it out last, five-year-old. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=349.08s)]
*  But they took the military out first. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=353.08s)]
*  And they were afraid of our military. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=355.52s)]
*  When I was there, they were afraid. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=356.88s)]
*  We didn't have one soldier killed in 18 months, second. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=359.08s)]
*  Not one soldier was killed in 18 months. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=363.52s)]
*  And then we got out like we surrendered. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=366.12s)]
*  I think it was the single most embarrassing day in the history of our country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  It was totally their fault. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  They didn't go by anything. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  Because, you know, we had a system of getting out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  But if the Taliban, in particular the Taliban, because that's where the action was, right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=378.56s)]
*  When I called Abdul, the press went crazy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=383.72s)]
*  The fake news went crazy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=387.24s)]
*  Why did he call an enemy? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=388.86s)]
*  I said, well, it's Jesse James. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  I used to ask him, why did he rob banks? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=392.36s)]
*  He said, that's where the money is. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  Why did I call the head of the Taliban? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=396.32s)]
*  Because that's where the killing was. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=398.26s)]
*  And he's there now, Abdul. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=401.05999999999995s)]
*  I'm sure he likes me. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=402.05999999999995s)]
*  Call me Your Excellency. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=403.32s)]
*  I don't know if he calls Biden Your Excellency. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=404.32s)]
*  Probably. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=406.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, they're one of the largest arms dealers now in the world. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=407.32s)]
*  They're selling the $85 billion worth of equipment. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=410.76s)]
*  They only need 5 percent of it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=412.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=414.55999999999995s)]
*  They're selling the equipment. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=415.55999999999995s)]
*  They're one of the largest. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  I think second, arms dealers are brand new helicopters, brand new airplanes, brand new [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=417.55999999999995s)]
*  tanks. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=423.79999999999995s)]
*  Unbelievable what we left behind. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=424.92s)]
*  We ran. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=427.48s)]
*  And there was no reason to. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=428.48s)]
*  I had them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  I could have stayed there for five years if I wanted to. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  I wanted out. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=434.12s)]
*  Twenty-one years was enough. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=435.12s)]
*  I wanted out. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  We shouldn't have been there in the first place. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  But when I see what happens, when I see the level of stupidity, and because of that, it's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=440.48s)]
*  all a big web. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=444.6s)]
*  Because of that, I think Putin, who would have never gone into Ukraine when I was there, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=446.56s)]
*  would have never — I talk to him about it often — would have never, ever done [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=451.24s)]
*  that, when he saw that I wasn't there, and he saw these fools, these stupid people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=454.8s)]
*  And think of that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=461.56s)]
*  The way they left Afghanistan and nobody was fired. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=462.56s)]
*  I fired a lot of people because if they didn't do a good job at farm, I'd put somebody else [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=466.28s)]
*  — [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=469.56s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=470.56s)]
*  Talk to Putin about Ukraine. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=471.56s)]
*  What did you say to him? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=472.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=473.56s)]
*  I could see that he loved it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=474.56s)]
*  And I said — [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=475.56s)]
*  He loved Ukraine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=476.56s)]
*  He considers it to be a part of Russia. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=477.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=480.52s)]
*  I said, not when I'm president. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=481.52s)]
*  We had a very good relationship. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=483.84s)]
*  He was — I mean, look, I was the worst thing that ever happened to him. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  I closed up his pipeline. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  You never heard the words Nord Stream 2 until I came along. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=493.84s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 was their pipeline. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=497.96s)]
*  And I had a great relationship with him, but it was very tough because they had a fake [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=500.7s)]
*  Russia investigation. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=504.4s)]
*  And I told him — and he told me. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=506.44s)]
*  He said, it's very hard for us to deal, don't you think? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=507.88s)]
*  I said, very hard, because we have a fake investigation that turned out to be a fake [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=511.0s)]
*  for two years that went on. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=514.12s)]
*  And we could have done very well with Russia. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=516.64s)]
*  They have great minerals. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=518.44s)]
*  They have great things that we want, we could have, and they need the money and they need [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=519.44s)]
*  other things. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=523.44s)]
*  But that interfered. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=525.32s)]
*  That was a terrible thing. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=527.68s)]
*  That was actually a treasonous thing to do. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=528.68s)]
*  Those people should have been arrested. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=531.32s)]
*  They made it up. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=532.54s)]
*  They made up a problem with Russia that didn't exist. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=533.98s)]
*  Now they've all admitted it didn't exist. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=537.52s)]
*  It was just on to the next one. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=539.12s)]
*  I often say — they said to me the other day, one of your fellow journalists said, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=542.0s)]
*  who's the biggest problem, sir? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=549.28s)]
*  Is it China? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=550.96s)]
*  Could it be Russia? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=552.52s)]
*  Could it be North Korea? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=553.52s)]
*  No. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=554.52s)]
*  I said, the biggest problem is from within. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=555.52s)]
*  It's these sick, radical people from within, because we can handle — if we're smart [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=556.52s)]
*  — we can handle Russia, China. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=562.4s)]
*  I did. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=564.96s)]
*  I took in billions and billions — hundreds of billions of dollars from China. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=566.46s)]
*  No other president took in anything. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=570.58s)]
*  And they respected me. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=572.46s)]
*  Here's the same thing, you know. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=573.46s)]
*  I told them, you can't go into Taiwan. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  You can't. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=577.46s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=578.46s)]
*  I won't tell you exactly what I said, but it was something that probably a lot of people [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=579.46s)]
*  wouldn't like if they heard it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=583.46s)]
*  But it was very tough. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=584.46s)]
*  Don't go into Taiwan. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=585.46s)]
*  If you do, we're going to have problems. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=586.46s)]
*  Other than that, we're going to be — great relationship. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=588.58s)]
*  We're going to have a great relationship. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=590.58s)]
*  He said to me when I said, we're going to do something if he goes into — no, no, no, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=594.5799999999999s)]
*  you wouldn't do it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=598.5s)]
*  I'll do that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=599.5s)]
*  I swear I'll do that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=600.5s)]
*  And he didn't believe me, but he believed me 10 percent. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=602.3399999999999s)]
*  The same thing with Putin. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=604.78s)]
*  I said I was going to do something really nasty if he goes into Ukraine. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=605.78s)]
*  He said, no, no, you're not going to do that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=610.14s)]
*  I said, I will. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=612.02s)]
*  And he didn't believe me, but he believed me 10 percent. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  And the 10 percent — you never heard talk about going into Ukraine. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=617.18s)]
*  You never heard talk about going into Taiwan until I was no longer there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=620.26s)]
*  Now what a mess the world is in. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=626.38s)]
*  What a mess. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBrchL8QnI&t=629.54s)]
