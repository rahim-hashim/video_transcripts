# Teacher faces being fired for exposing critical race theory
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw)
*  An Indiana educator named Tony Kinnett recently came on the show to speak out against critical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=0.0s)]
*  race theory in his school district. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=5.88s)]
*  He exposed the fact that, counter to what officials were telling parents, racist CRT [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=8.32s)]
*  was in fact being taught to kids. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=13.32s)]
*  We can officially tell parents we're not teaching critical race theory. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=16.92s)]
*  It's not in the Indiana academic standards. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=20.38s)]
*  But all of a sudden, the classroom door shuts and the teacher starts teaching through a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=22.68s)]
*  lens of this race essentialism that pits students against each other based on their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=26.72s)]
*  color. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=31.04s)]
*  For saying that and for telling the truth, Tony Kinnett may lose his job. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=32.04s)]
*  He's been recommended for firing following a suspension and investigation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=36.76s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=41.32s)]
*  Did they give you a legitimate reason? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  Did they say, you know, you went on Fox and you said this, or did they cook up some BS [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=46.8s)]
*  and fractions and use that to justify this firing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=51.84s)]
*  You had to use the word legitimate, didn't you? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  They cobbled together quite a few charges that really had nothing to do with my accusations [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=59.28s)]
*  of critical race theory, at least at the surface. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=64.72s)]
*  Of course, there are different charges saying that I had used the Indianapolis public files [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=68.52s)]
*  for my own personal gain, that I had misquoted district officials, which of course isn't [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=73.68s)]
*  true. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=78.88s)]
*  And realistically, in the meetings, though, they whined about my appearing on Tucker Carlson [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  tonight several times in every single meeting, whether it was H.R., whether it my supervisor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=84.64s)]
*  yelling at me about it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  Everyone was horrified that I would share publicly available emails on Fox News. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=91.0s)]
*  So this was publicly available information, part of the curriculum. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  You shared it to the public. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=99.72s)]
*  It seems like they're ashamed or they're embarrassed because you expose the fact that they're teaching [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  unpopular and subversive material to schoolchildren. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Is that how you assess it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=114.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=116.68s)]
*  I mean, we invited the Indy Black Lives Matter activists to come speak to a required audience [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=117.68s)]
*  of middle schoolers in which they told the students that, and I quote, crime does not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=123.08s)]
*  exist. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=127.76s)]
*  It is made up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=128.76s)]
*  And that was required for middle school students during the day. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=130.52s)]
*  Our curriculum office had no idea about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=133.36s)]
*  But suddenly, when we tell the public that this stuff is going on, it's embarrassment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=135.56s)]
*  And it doesn't matter whether it was publicly available information. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=139.76s)]
*  It's irrelevant. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=142.96s)]
*  People didn't sign up to have their emails and their files on in front of the public. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=144.44s)]
*  And of course, that's not true. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=148.88s)]
*  So the superintendent who wants to nail your hide to the wall, Dr. Alicia Johnson, she [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=150.84s)]
*  wants you fired. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=158.12s)]
*  She says she's going to fire you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=159.12s)]
*  Does she have any support in the community? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  I would assume that you would have the support of parents, teachers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=166.88s)]
*  Is she just doing this on a whim because she doesn't like you and she wants to keep the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=174.0s)]
*  fact that she's poisoning children's brains secret? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=177.76s)]
*  Well, there's really been a concerted effort in Indianapolis public schools to cover up [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  the actions of Dr. Patricia Payne, who's the director of racial equity. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  She runs the racial equity office in the district. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  And realistically, the entire upper administration has been horrified that I have been sharing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=193.12s)]
*  these publicly available documents with the public. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  As far as support, we've been blessed to receive a lot of parental support in the community. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  A lot of teachers from inside Indianapolis and some principals have reached out and expressed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=206.8s)]
*  their support. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=211.12s)]
*  They don't like what's going on inside Indianapolis either. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=212.12s)]
*  And realistically, the ratio of support to criticism has been immensely positive. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=214.8s)]
*  And we're very thankful for that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=219.52s)]
*  And do you have a good lawyer? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I have an excellent legal team. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=225.0s)]
*  Negengard has been phenomenal in making sure that I received legal support, even when Indianapolis [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  banned me from having an attorney. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=234.16s)]
*  We actually had to fight for 20 minutes in an HR meeting so that I could get the same [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=236.44s)]
*  representation rights that everyone else has. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=240.74s)]
*  It was an embarrassment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=243.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, if we've learned one thing throughout this pandemic, is that school administrators, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=244.06s)]
*  not all of them, but some of them could possibly be some of the worst people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=250.52s)]
*  We didn't know that before, but it's becoming more clear. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  Tony Kinnett, good luck. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=258.76s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=261.04s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the show. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSrF8Q7Tjw&t=262.48s)]
