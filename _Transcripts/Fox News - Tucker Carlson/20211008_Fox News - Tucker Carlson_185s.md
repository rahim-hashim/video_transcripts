# Tucker Carlson highlights the ‘courage’ of Fox News over 25 years
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw)
*  So it is the 25th anniversary of the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=3.84s)]
*  You've probably seen the great promos. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=4.64s)]
*  The channel's been running all week about that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=6.08s)]
*  But today is the day. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=8.32s)]
*  We've got one of our favorite people at Fox to join us in a minute [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=9.76s)]
*  to assess the last quarter century. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=12.72s)]
*  But first, we want to take you back to that day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=14.56s)]
*  This was 25 years ago today as it started. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=17.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=19.6s)]
*  We've now reached this moment when we can firmly announce [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=20.8s)]
*  the starting of a Fox News Channel and a much greater effort. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=24.48s)]
*  On the buildup of Fox News in every area. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=30.0s)]
*  We now see a fairly defined audience in numbers for CNN. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=33.68s)]
*  I think you'll find as more news channels, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=39.92s)]
*  and particularly our news channel, appear, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=42.08s)]
*  the audience will increase greatly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  So that was before it even started, actually. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  That was in 1996, 1995. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=50.32s)]
*  Nobody thought that was going to work in the news business. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=56.24s)]
*  At the time, I worked at another competing channel, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=58.4s)]
*  which was then number one, and happened to be in the room [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=60.32s)]
*  on the very first day that this channel went on the air. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=62.96s)]
*  I was covering Bob Dole who was running for president. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=65.92s)]
*  He was one of the very first guests. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=67.92s)]
*  In a room full of reporters covering the Dole campaign, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  there was not a single person, including me, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=71.84s)]
*  who thought this would work. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=74.24s)]
*  Another news channel? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=75.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=76.32s)]
*  But it did work, and it worked for a couple of important reasons. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=77.6s)]
*  First, you had really smart and really committed people running them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=80.88s)]
*  One of those people was Roger Ailes, who was the creative force [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=86.16s)]
*  behind a lot of what you saw on the air. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=89.28s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=91.84s)]
*  We're not starting up a reactive news service here in any way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=93.68s)]
*  Our job is to be objective. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=97.68s)]
*  We'd like to be premier journalists. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=99.52s)]
*  We'd like to restore objectivity where we find it lacking. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  So we just expect to do fine, balanced journalism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=106.72s)]
*  A lot's been said about Roger Ailes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=110.88s)]
*  Not sure how much we can add to that, other than to point out [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=114.24s)]
*  that man understood people, human nature, TV talent [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=117.52s)]
*  better than really anybody. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  And that turned out to be massively important. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=123.6s)]
*  But over the years, the single most important quality, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  the quality that has allowed this channel to continue [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=129.68s)]
*  and thrive for a quarter century, is courage. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=132.0s)]
*  The belief that we are doing something important [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  by letting people talk. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=137.92s)]
*  Lachlan Murdoch has taken over. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=140.32s)]
*  Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace running it day to day. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=142.64s)]
*  The one thing they have in common, in addition to being really nice people, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  is that they are totally committed to the freedom of speech. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=148.56s)]
*  Do they agree with everything we say on this show or other shows? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=152.0s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=154.32s)]
*  They've never told us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=154.88s)]
*  What we do know is that they have a bedrock, unshakable belief [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=155.92s)]
*  that the First Amendment is real and that we are the living embodiment of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  You can tell the truth on Fox News. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=164.72s)]
*  Period. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=167.44s)]
*  It's not easy to do that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=168.24s)]
*  It takes enormous toughness. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  We're grateful to them every day for that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZW6aDC6CRw&t=170.64s)]
