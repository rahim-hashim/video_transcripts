# Tucker Carlson: Tulsi Gabbard committed the unforgivable sin to the Democrats
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=0.0s)]
*  So when Tulsi Gabbard won the Democratic Party's primary [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=2.64s)]
*  for a congressional seat in Hawaii 10 years ago, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=5.68s)]
*  she'd effectively won the seat. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=8.24s)]
*  Hawaii may be the most liberal out of all 50 states. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  It is a democratic state, flat out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=13.32s)]
*  It has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=15.48s)]
*  in nearly 40 years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=17.92s)]
*  So if you get elected as a Democrat in Hawaii, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=19.96s)]
*  it's not exactly breaking news, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  it's standard operating procedure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=23.76s)]
*  And yet when Tulsi Gabbard won that primary [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=25.92s)]
*  and then the seat, the Democratic National Party [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=28.24s)]
*  took a deep interest in her and you can see why. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=30.24s)]
*  Here was a smart, appealing 31-year-old [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=33.16s)]
*  who knew what she believed and could explain it fluently. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=36.4s)]
*  And by the way, she was also an Iraq War veteran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=39.8s)]
*  So in political terms, Tulsi Gabbard was near perfect [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=42.04s)]
*  and they got it immediately. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=45.08s)]
*  Barack Obama endorsed her right away. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=46.04s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi called her personally [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=48.8s)]
*  and invited Tulsi Gabbard, did you remember this? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=50.68s)]
*  To speak on the opening night [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=53.0s)]
*  of the Democratic National Convention. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=54.64s)]
*  And then once she was sworn into Congress in January, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=57.16s)]
*  the DNC named Tulsi Gabbard vice chair of the national party. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=59.68s)]
*  She'd just gotten there [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  and she was vice chair of the DNC. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  And then of course the media played its prescribed role. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  If Nancy Pelosi likes you, well, so do they. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=69.4s)]
*  So fawning profile after fawning profile emerged. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=71.88s)]
*  If you lived in Washington at the time, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=75.44s)]
*  you remember it very well. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=76.92s)]
*  Here, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  the future of the Democratic Party, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=79.72s)]
*  In case you don't remember, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=82.28s)]
*  here's a selection to jog your memory. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=83.92s)]
*  Watch out for the next superstar. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  There we go. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=88.88s)]
*  We've been talking about her off air all week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=89.72s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=91.36s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=92.44s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a rising star in this party. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=93.84s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard should be here tonight. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=96.72s)]
*  The reality is we do not have enough young veterans [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=98.68s)]
*  in this party, enough young women in this party, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=101.44s)]
*  enough people calling this party. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  You're considered a rising star in the Democratic Party. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  You had a position of leadership [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=106.92s)]
*  in the Democratic National Committee. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=108.44s)]
*  Tulsi's story is really, I think, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=110.48s)]
*  tailor-made for Hollywood. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  I half expect Natalie Portman to be vying for the role [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  any day now, because this story is not to be believed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=115.96s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, she is going to be the one [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=119.0s)]
*  to watch tonight at the DNC. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=120.8s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, she's an Iraq war veteran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=123.16s)]
*  Yesterday she was promoted from captain to major [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=125.08s)]
*  in the Hawaii National Guard. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  So she certainly is a rising star. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=129.04s)]
*  The fact that she's not here tonight [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  for whatever reason is unfortunate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know, but in a battle, I want her in my trench. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  I can hear that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=136.24s)]
*  Me too, me too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=139.04s)]
*  She's a rising star. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=139.88s)]
*  Hollywood's gonna make a movie about her. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=141.44s)]
*  I want her in my trench. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=143.68s)]
*  It's pretty hard to believe now, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=146.44s)]
*  but that was the absolute consensus [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=147.4s)]
*  among Democratic Party sycophants until 2016. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=149.44s)]
*  In 2016, as if by command from above, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=153.96s)]
*  the fawning stopped abruptly, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  replaced initially by silence, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=159.36s)]
*  and then by howls of scorned rage. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=161.12s)]
*  So what happened in 2016? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=164.52s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump was elected president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  And then a few days later, displaying the independence [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  of spirit that Democrats claim to love in young women, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=171.0s)]
*  but actually despise more than anything, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard decided to talk to the new president [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  about an issue that she cared about, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=178.24s)]
*  which was US policy towards Syria, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=179.68s)]
*  a country that, again, Gabbard was virtually alone [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  and pointing out has an awful lot of Christians in it, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=183.8s)]
*  so maybe we should pay attention. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=185.56s)]
*  As she put it at the time, quote, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=187.36s)]
*  "'I felt it was important to take the opportunity [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=188.88s)]
*  to meet with the president-elect now, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=190.68s)]
*  before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=192.84s)]
*  drag us into an escalation of the war [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=195.36s)]
*  to overthrow the Syrian government.'" [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=197.6s)]
*  Whoo, we can't say that in Washington. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=199.72s)]
*  Maybe she didn't know. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=201.4s)]
*  But they told her, stop. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=202.76s)]
*  Let the adults do it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=205.0s)]
*  But Gabbard didn't seem to care. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=205.84s)]
*  A few weeks later, she went personally to Syria. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=207.68s)]
*  She was a member of Congress, you can do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=210.08s)]
*  And she wanted to see conditions for herself. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=212.12s)]
*  And then while she was there, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=214.36s)]
*  she met with the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=215.18s)]
*  That was it, it was over. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=218.28s)]
*  Whether Tulsi Gabbard knew it or not, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  her career as a rising star within the Democratic party [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=222.44s)]
*  came to a complete, abrupt and final halt. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=225.68s)]
*  She had done the one thing you're not allowed to do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=230.16s)]
*  She committed the one unforgivable sin, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=231.88s)]
*  which is to question permanent Washington's foreign policy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=234.32s)]
*  You can't do that and everyone knows it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  And if you look around, you can see that no one does do it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=240.16s)]
*  They always tell you, radical Sandy Cortez is, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Would they do that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  No way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=247.4s)]
*  AOC may be a socialist, but in the end, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=250.0s)]
*  she's with Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney on team Raytheon. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=252.38s)]
*  She does not cross that line because you're not allowed to. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=256.52s)]
*  But Tulsi Gabbard is someone who had served [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=259.88s)]
*  in the US military, in fact, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=261.8s)]
*  was still serving in the US military, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=262.76s)]
*  and she was an elected member of Congress, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=265.08s)]
*  decided why shouldn't I say what I think? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=267.36s)]
*  And so she did. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=270.36s)]
*  And for doing that, overnight, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=271.2s)]
*  her fellow Democrats accused Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  the combat veteran you'd want in your foxhole, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=276.0s)]
*  of committing treason against the country she was serving. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=279.68s)]
*  Hillary Clinton went even farther than that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=283.88s)]
*  Speaking of conspiracy nuts, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=285.76s)]
*  Hillary Clinton way crazier than Alex Jones [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=287.44s)]
*  ever thought of being. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=289.32s)]
*  She claimed the Russians were grooming Tulsi Gabbard [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=290.32s)]
*  as a Manchurian candidate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=294.84s)]
*  You want to listen to lunacy? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=295.68s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=296.5s)]
*  I'm not making any predictions, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=297.92s)]
*  but I think they've got their eye on somebody [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=299.64s)]
*  who's currently in the Democratic primary [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=301.48s)]
*  and are grooming her to be the third party candidate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=304.16s)]
*  She's a favorite of the Russians. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=306.94s)]
*  Well, that's just completely whacked. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=310.04s)]
*  Was she a crisis actor too? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=312.16s)]
*  What a lunatic. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=314.08s)]
*  But no one noticed because everyone was saying it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=315.28s)]
*  The LA Times, which at one point was an actual newspaper, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=319.84s)]
*  accused Tulsi Gabbard of, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=322.44s)]
*  talking like a Russian asset, maybe a spy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=324.24s)]
*  So the years went by and Tulsi Gabbard [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  decided to run for president, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  still as a Democrat, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=331.72s)]
*  as she had been in her entire time in Congress. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=333.12s)]
*  She'd always been a Democrat, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=337.12s)]
*  of course, the vice chair of the DNC. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=338.0s)]
*  And so she wound up in a presidential debate [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  in October of 2019, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  and she responded to the smears against her. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=345.92s)]
*  New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=347.44s)]
*  like myself for calling for an end [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  to this regime change war. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  Just two days ago, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=355.56s)]
*  the New York Times put out an article [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=356.38s)]
*  saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=358.88s)]
*  and all these different smears. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=364.26s)]
*  that I'm an asset of Russia, completely despicable. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=367.76s)]
*  As president, I will end these regime change wars [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  by doing two things, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=376.64s)]
*  ending the draconian sanctions [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=378.64s)]
*  that are really a modern day siege, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=380.52s)]
*  the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  wage against Yemen that have caused [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=384.46s)]
*  tens and thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=386.12s)]
*  And I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=390.84s)]
*  like Al-Qaeda in Syria, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=394.12s)]
*  who've been the ground force [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=396.28s)]
*  in this ongoing regime change war. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  They called her a Russian asset. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=402.24s)]
*  Now that slur is so common that we don't really think about, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  but think about it just for a second. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=406.8s)]
*  This is a transparently patriotic person, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=408.0s)]
*  an elected member of Congress [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=412.12s)]
*  who was serving in the US Army, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=413.6s)]
*  who's also by the way, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=415.68s)]
*  one of the nicest people in all of Washington, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=416.52s)]
*  who is making traditionally liberal points about war. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=419.68s)]
*  Not that all wars are bad or war is never necessary. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=423.98s)]
*  She's participated in wars personally. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=427.2s)]
*  She's merely saying and has said dozens of times [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=429.82s)]
*  on television that wars that don't benefit the United States [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=432.62s)]
*  are probably a bad idea for us to engage in. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=436.16s)]
*  That's all she said. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  And for that, she was run out of town. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=441.48s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=444.6s)]
*  Why is that such an unacceptable thing to say? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=445.44s)]
*  Well, of course, because there's a pattern here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=447.54s)]
*  Certain people do benefit from wars and they want more. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  So three years after that debate, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=451.8s)]
*  another US funded regime change war is underway. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=454.56s)]
*  And that is exactly what's happening. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=458.58000000000004s)]
*  This time, our stated goal is removing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=459.92s)]
*  not some third world dictator who might have WMD, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=461.88s)]
*  but removing a guy who was the world's [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=464.72s)]
*  largest nuclear stockpile, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  6,300 nuclear warheads, Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=467.68s)]
*  And once again, because Tulsi Gabbard has questioned [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=471.48s)]
*  the wisdom of this complete lunacy, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=474.0s)]
*  Democrats are accusing her of working for Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=477.70000000000005s)]
*  So if you wanna know what the Democratic party [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=481.32000000000005s)]
*  actually believes, don't listen to what they say. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=483.36s)]
*  Oh, we want empowered women of color who are also veterans. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=486.36s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  They want people who support regime change war. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=490.48s)]
*  That's their red line. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=493.24s)]
*  That's the one thing they will brook [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=495.0s)]
*  no dissent on whatsoever. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't care what you think about that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=499.56s)]
*  They don't wanna debate you on it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=502.1s)]
*  If you disagree or even ask questions, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=505.86s)]
*  they go right to traitor. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  So today, Tulsi Gabbard did what is probably inevitable [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=511.02000000000004s)]
*  and probably has been since 2016. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=513.88s)]
*  She left her own party, the Democratic party. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=515.88s)]
*  And we don't have to guess as to why, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=518.84s)]
*  because she explained it in some detail. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=520.04s)]
*  And we ask you, please listen carefully to this [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=521.52s)]
*  because it's inspiring and interesting. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=523.68s)]
*  And she did it on her new podcast [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=525.68s)]
*  called the Tulsi Gabbard Show, it launched today. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=527.04s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=528.76s)]
*  I can no longer remain in today's Democratic party. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=530.2399999999999s)]
*  It's now under the complete control [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=532.88s)]
*  of an elitist cabal of warmongers [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=535.06s)]
*  driven by cowardly wokeness, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=537.12s)]
*  who divide us by racializing every issue [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=539.8599999999999s)]
*  and stoking anti-white racism, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=543.12s)]
*  who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=545.8s)]
*  enshrined in our constitution, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=549.12s)]
*  and who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=551.52s)]
*  who demonize the police, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=555.52s)]
*  who protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=556.86s)]
*  who believe in open borders, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  who weaponize the national security state [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  to go after their political opponents, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=565.16s)]
*  and above all, are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=567.04s)]
*  Now, these are some of the main reasons [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=572.68s)]
*  I'm leaving the Democratic party. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=574.84s)]
*  So keep in mind until today, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=576.9s)]
*  this was a registered Democrat, an office holder, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=579.54s)]
*  a standard bearer of the Democratic party, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=582.9s)]
*  the future of the Democratic party [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=584.5s)]
*  from the country's most liberal state. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=586.4599999999999s)]
*  This was a liberal Democrat. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=588.42s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=591.3s)]
*  Is there a single word you disagree with? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=592.14s)]
*  Is there a single word that the Republican [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=594.38s)]
*  who represents you, who you send money to, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=596.3399999999999s)]
*  who you vote for, would repeat in public? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=598.26s)]
*  In other words, here you have someone who until yesterday [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  was a member of the Democratic party, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  was a member of the Democratic party, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=604.98s)]
*  saying things the overwhelming majority [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=606.3800000000001s)]
*  of Republican voters believe, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  but only a tiny, a vanishingly small minority [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  of Republican office holders are willing to say out loud [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=612.98s)]
*  because it's too scary. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=614.98s)]
*  Oh, it just tells you so much. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgueSM1SdM&t=617.0200000000001s)]
