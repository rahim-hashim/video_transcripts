# Upcoming govt agency report lists more than 150 UFO encounters
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA)
*  We haven't done a lot of UFO stories lately, but that doesn't mean the phenomenon has subsided. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, it seems to be accelerating, settings the government cannot explain. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=13.96s)]
*  The Daily Mail is reporting tonight exclusively that the Office of the Director of National [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=17.78s)]
*  Intelligence is about to send a classified report to Congress in which the government [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=21.32s)]
*  details more than 150 cases of unexplained UFO encounters in just the past year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=25.88s)]
*  In all, the report looked into more than 300 total encounters, and of those, half could [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=32.76s)]
*  not be explained. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=38.6s)]
*  An amazing story, really. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=41.0s)]
*  150. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=42.64s)]
*  Josh Boswell is the reporter at the Daily Mail who broke the story. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=43.64s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=46.0s)]
*  Josh, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=47.0s)]
*  That seems like an awful lot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=49.32s)]
*  Over what period were these 150 unexplained sightings? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=51.64s)]
*  It could be significantly more than 150, but it's over just one year. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  The previous report we had was 143 unexplained cases from 2004 all the way up to 2021. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=59.76s)]
*  This is a significant increase, it seems. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=67.36s)]
*  It's an exponential increase. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=69.96s)]
*  I guess we can only guess, or maybe you know the answer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=71.32s)]
*  What does this suggest? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=74.68s)]
*  Part of the answer will be that the government is now looking for these things. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=77.4s)]
*  They have much better reporting procedures. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=80.84s)]
*  If an F-18 pilot comes across one of these objects that's hovering above the sea that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=82.68s)]
*  they're flying around, they're more likely to report it now because there's a proper [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=87.92s)]
*  procedure in place. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=91.04s)]
*  But also, I am hearing that we are encountering more and more of these things from sources [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  that I speak to. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  It seems like it's a phenomena that is not going away and needs to be investigated. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=98.92000000000002s)]
*  So there's been a lot of speculation about this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  There was a Wall Street Journal piece recently that suggested this is actually a PsyOp by [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=104.92000000000002s)]
*  the US government designed to draw your attention away from the fact that these objects are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=109.04s)]
*  in fact some advanced military hardware the US government itself has and wants to keep [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  secret. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=117.92s)]
*  What's your understanding of what government officials believe about these objects? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=118.92s)]
*  Well, the sources that I have are telling me they just don't know what these things [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  are. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=128.56s)]
*  There's a proportion of these cases, 366 in this classified report that's going to Congress [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=129.56s)]
*  probably tomorrow, that are explained that are Chinese drones, for example. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=134.84s)]
*  But the unexplained ones, they just have no clue because these things are moving in ways [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=139.4s)]
*  that we just don't understand at hypersonic speeds and then they just turn on a dime. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=144.12s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=149.76s)]
*  It would seem a little strange if the government were calling attention to its own classified [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=152.16s)]
*  weapons programs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=155.12s)]
*  So what you're saying, I think, makes sense. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=156.56s)]
*  Josh Paswell, thank you for this report. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=158.28s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2h5bQDACPA&t=159.76s)]
