# How did Gina Carano react to being fired by Disney?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg)
*  Gina Carano was a pretty famous mixed martial artist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=0.0s)]
*  then she became an actress and became even more successful. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=3.64s)]
*  She appeared in films like Deadpool and Fast and Furious. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=6.08s)]
*  For a while she was on the Disney show, The Mandalorian, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=9.56s)]
*  but then her career hit a brick wall. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=12.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=14.48s)]
*  Well, she was fired because she had heterodox opinions [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=15.46s)]
*  on face masks and the 2020 election. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=18.48s)]
*  She wasn't particularly political or certainly not a partisan, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=21.94s)]
*  but they crushed her for it, but she's unbound. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  We sat down with her for a brand new episode [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  of Jekyll and Carlson today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=29.12s)]
*  Pretty amazing interview. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=31.36s)]
*  Here is Gina Carano explaining how she responded [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=32.96s)]
*  when Disney told her she had to give her pronouns. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=35.24s)]
*  ["I'm Not Doing This"] [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=39.46s)]
*  When I wouldn't hashtag trans rights [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=44.28s)]
*  and I wouldn't put my pronouns in, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=46.24s)]
*  they kept on it pressuring and finally I just said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=48.3s)]
*  I'm not doing this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=51.58s)]
*  What are the pronouns? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=54.64s)]
*  I didn't even know what people were talking about. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  I was just not clued in to the pronouns thing, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=57.42s)]
*  which apparently that's been happening [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  for like seven, eight years now, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=62.54s)]
*  It's been happening for a while. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=65.22s)]
*  But no one has ever explained its purpose. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=66.06s)]
*  I mean, you're just supposed to know. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=69.26s)]
*  And if you don't know, you're a bigot. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=71.78s)]
*  Well, then I put beep bop boop in my... [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=73.5s)]
*  Beep bop boop. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  So that, if I'm translating, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=77.78s)]
*  that just means middle finger to you, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=79.86s)]
*  Well, that just meant I can put anything I want in my bio. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  I can do whatever I want. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=86.26s)]
*  That's all that was. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  Because you thought it was a free country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I thought it was a... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=92.06s)]
*  I was speaking out about lockdowns, masks, vaccinations [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=92.9s)]
*  and pronouns way before anybody was even [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=95.94s)]
*  like saying a word about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=99.54s)]
*  And so I was a little bit ahead. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=101.5s)]
*  I'm sure if I would have done that now, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=102.94s)]
*  it wouldn't have been a big deal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=104.26s)]
*  But because I was talking about this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  when nobody else was talking about it, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=106.86000000000001s)]
*  especially nobody else in my industry, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=108.22s)]
*  it was like, Lucasfilm called me and they were like, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=109.76s)]
*  okay, we're gonna need you to go on a Zoom call [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  with 45 of our LGBTQ community. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=117.06s)]
*  And we have to get you on the phone with these people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=120.98s)]
*  We need to have you watch all of these trans, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=123.38s)]
*  these movies about the trans lives documentaries. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=126.92s)]
*  And I was like, okay, I'll watch your documentaries [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=130.66s)]
*  and I'll talk to your people, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=133.1s)]
*  but I'm not gonna get on a Zoom call [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=135.02s)]
*  with 45 different people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=136.34s)]
*  who can have their phones out videotaping me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  And I feel like that's extremely abusive. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=140.26s)]
*  We just become fascinated in the last two years [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=144.9s)]
*  by bravery and where it emerges [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=147.1s)]
*  in people you would never expect it to emerge in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=149.22s)]
*  That's a brave woman and a really interesting conversation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=151.98s)]
*  It's Tucker Carlson today, tomorrow 7 a.m. on Fox Nation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsExgrfl-tg&t=155.02s)]
