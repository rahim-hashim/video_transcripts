# Brazilian president talks protection of life and faith with Tucker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10)
*  For decades, Joe Biden freely admitted that the Roe v. Wade decision was bad law and inherently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=0.0s)]
*  extreme. Quote, I don't like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I don't think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=10.4s)]
*  which makes sense because you can't create a baby without a man. So why is it not a man's issue too? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Shut up, they screamed. But Joe Biden has changed his view. Now he will say precisely what they tell [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=19.84s)]
*  him to say. Today, he attacked the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Watch. We have the strongest economy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=25.76s)]
*  in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world. The one thing that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=33.2s)]
*  has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=37.84s)]
*  on overruling not only Roe v. Wade, but essentially challenging the right to privacy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=43.84s)]
*  We've been a leader in the world in terms of personal rights and privacy rights, and it is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=49.6s)]
*  a mistake in my view for the Supreme Court to do what it did. We're a leader in the world in terms [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=54.72s)]
*  of personal rights, unless you criticize Joe Biden on the internet, in which case the FBI may wind [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=61.68s)]
*  up at your house, but free speech is no longer a personal right nor a self-defense. So here in Brazil, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=66.8s)]
*  it is still a mostly pro-life country. It's still mostly a Christian country, but the left here would [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=72.32s)]
*  very much like to change that. Babies are the problem. We spoke to Bolsonaro about this. We [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  also talked about his gun policies and how, provably, allowing civilians to protect themselves [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=82.56s)]
*  has reduced violent crime. Here it is. What are your opponent's views of Christianity? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=90.0s)]
*  The left wing, I mean, the vast majority of them are atheists. They do not respect anything. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  They criticize priests and pastors, and Lula himself has said that he will, if elected, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=105.92s)]
*  he will place priests and pastors and the military in their rightful place, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=111.6s)]
*  or in the right place in society. For instance, when the U.S. Supreme Court recently changed its [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=116.16s)]
*  understanding and ruling on abortion, the left wing in Brazil did not like that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=124.72s)]
*  We did like the new stance taken by the U.S. Supreme Court because we defend life from its [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  very conception, but not so among the left-wing people in Lula. Lula and the left wing, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=134.48s)]
*  they often say that abortion is a matter of public health and it is the woman that should decide. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=141.92s)]
*  We believe that the life that has been given to a woman does not belong to the woman, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  and that is a stance espoused by our religion. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  The federal Supreme Court Chief Justice Barroso, who favors abortion, he himself stated that it is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=157.28s)]
*  not the right time to discuss that issue yet. And in case he goes back to power, because there are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=162.88s)]
*  two more positions to be appointed to the Supreme Court, he will certainly, if elected, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=170.4s)]
*  appoint chief justices that will support the abortion policy. In Colombia, for example, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=177.36s)]
*  abortion has been confirmed by the Supreme Court. In Brazil, the Supreme Court has interfered a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=183.52s)]
*  great deal, not only in the legislative, but also in the judiciary, of course. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=188.08s)]
*  Lula and the left wing believe that once they do come back to power, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  it would be irrelevant to count on those who are elected in Congress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=202.24s)]
*  Because they will actually wield power over Parliament, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=205.68s)]
*  and they will be able to legislate through the Supreme Court, just as they have legislated on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=210.96s)]
*  issues such as homophobia and nepotism, which is, of course, the policy of employing members of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=216.32s)]
*  your own family as a publicly appointed member of Congress. And they will be able to do that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=221.68s)]
*  in the Supreme Court, as well. And they will be able to do that in the Supreme Court, as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  We lowered the tax called IPS, the tax on industrialized goods, and the Supreme Court [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=235.68s)]
*  said that was not correct. They changed it. Very often, the Supreme Court in Brazil, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=240.56s)]
*  they make decisions that should otherwise be only decided by the executives, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  such as, for example, federal taxes. The left in Brazil, Lula, seem to be trying to introduce [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=250.16s)]
*  identity politics, American-style race, resentment-based politics into Brazil. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=257.44s)]
*  Do you notice this, and is it working? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=263.04s)]
*  It is a way to divide and conquer. You know, even before Lula took office in 2003, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=268.08s)]
*  the left wing would already preach that. I mean, the division of people along identity lines, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=273.92s)]
*  such as blacks and whites and employers and employees and people from the northeastern [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=278.8s)]
*  Brazil vis-a-vis southern Brazil, they have gained followers as a result of that approach. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=284.08s)]
*  And the major divisionary split today is between employers and employees. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=290.24s)]
*  Lots of followers, and they say that, hey, you're not doing well today because of your employer. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=295.6s)]
*  And that divide approach or policy, the workers probably have always gained at least one-fourth [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=301.36s)]
*  of the Brazil population. They have always been supported by at least one-fourth of the Brazilian [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=306.64s)]
*  population. My father-in-law is known as Paulo Negão, black man, and I am blue-eyed white man. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Racism is there in Brazil, yes, but not as it is often described. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=318.24s)]
*  Most of our main football players are, you know, people of African descent. No worries. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=323.68s)]
*  You've liberalized gun laws here. You've made it easier for civilians to own firearms. Why did [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  you do that? I was unable to actually change the Brazilian law, but by means of a presidential [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=334.24s)]
*  decree and also through ministerial orders, we interpreted the existing legislation as best as [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=342.08s)]
*  possible. And there has been a substantial increase in the number of people who own, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=348.32s)]
*  legally own firearms in Brazil. And the consequences you see in the Brazilian media is the drop or a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=353.52s)]
*  drop in the number of people who are killed by firearms in Brazil. We believe, we understand [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=360.0s)]
*  that once people get armed, you know, the crooks, the thieves will think twice before they break [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  into other people's property. If, of course, the number had gone up, I would be blamed. But [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=370.56s)]
*  just the opposite is going on today. And if we elected, if everything goes well, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=376.16s)]
*  we will have a substantial support in Congress and we will be able to pass laws on firearms [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=380.88s)]
*  very much along the same lines as in the U.S. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSiLFyxj10&t=386.0s)]
