# Kanye West exclusive: Rapper tells Tucker Carlson story behind White Lives Matter shirt
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=0.0s)]
*  Kanye West, now known as Ye, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  is one of the best selling musical artists in the world. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=4.82s)]
*  He's also in recent years become a celebrated [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=7.5s)]
*  and very highly paid fashion designer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=9.5s)]
*  And of course for a decade, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=11.84s)]
*  he was well known to TV audiences [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=12.84s)]
*  as an in-law of the Kardashian family. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=14.48s)]
*  But it's West's latest incarnation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=16.88s)]
*  as a kind of Christian evangelist [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=18.72s)]
*  that brought us to his office in Los Angeles today [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=20.76s)]
*  for the interview you're about to see. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=22.88s)]
*  Days ago during fashion week in Paris, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=25.18s)]
*  Kanye West accompanied by his friend, Candace Owens, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=27.68s)]
*  unveiled a t-shirt that read simply, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=30.52s)]
*  White Lives Matter. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=32.48s)]
*  The response from the fashion industry [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=34.48s)]
*  and international media was instantaneous and uniform. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  Shock, horror, rage. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=39.36s)]
*  There is no excuse for this, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=42.0s)]
*  thundered the New York Times. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=43.8s)]
*  West is legitimizing extremism, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=45.16s)]
*  shrieked Rolling Stone, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=47.32s)]
*  What was strikingly missing from the coverage however, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=50.54s)]
*  was any explanation for why West did this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=52.56s)]
*  What was the t-shirt about? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=55.16s)]
*  No one seemed to think to ask him [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=57.48s)]
*  much less to listen to what he had to say. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Instead the enemies of his ideas dismissed West [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=61.62s)]
*  as they have for years as mentally ill. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=64.44s)]
*  Too crazy to take seriously. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=67.16s)]
*  Look away, ignore him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=68.66s)]
*  He's a mental patient. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=70.24s)]
*  There's nothing to see here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=71.42s)]
*  But is West crazy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  You can judge for yourself [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  as you watch what we're about to show you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=77.18s)]
*  He has his own ideas, we can say that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=79.16s)]
*  Creative people tend to. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=81.2s)]
*  That's why they're artists, not actuaries. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=83.02s)]
*  His freeform social media posts [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=85.32s)]
*  give the impression of a man [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=86.92s)]
*  channeling his rawest emotions right onto Instagram. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=88.04s)]
*  The effect can be jarring [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=92.16s)]
*  and is often used as ammunition against him [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=93.28s)]
*  in the battle for influence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  over the minds of America's young people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=97.16s)]
*  And that battle is intense. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  But crazy? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=101.38s)]
*  That was not our conclusion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=103.04s)]
*  In fact, we've rarely heard a man speak so honestly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=104.92s)]
*  and so movingly about what he believes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=108.12s)]
*  But again, you can judge for yourself. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=111.12s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  So you just came from Paris Fashion Week, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=115.36s)]
*  you just landed and you have a lanyard still on from it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=117.56s)]
*  and there's a photograph on it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=120.2s)]
*  What is that? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=121.8s)]
*  It's a photograph of a baby's ultrasound. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=123.12s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=126.48s)]
*  And you designed that? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=127.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=128.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=129.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=130.02s)]
*  It just represents life, I'm pro-life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=130.92s)]
*  Boy, so you wear it on a badge. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  What kind of response do you get? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=135.48s)]
*  And good, amen, I agree. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=137.2s)]
*  I don't care about people's responses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=138.84s)]
*  I care about the fact that there's more [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=140.32s)]
*  black babies being aborted than born in New York City [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=143.04s)]
*  at this point. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=146.56s)]
*  That 50% of black death in America is abortion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=147.4s)]
*  So I really don't care about people's responses. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  I perform for an audience of one and that's God. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=155.68s)]
*  I'm starting to see why they want to make you be quiet. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=160.72s)]
*  When did you start to feel this way? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=165.32s)]
*  When did you start to realize this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  I really felt like, I think I started to really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=173.32s)]
*  feel this need to express myself on another level [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=176.48s)]
*  when Trump was running for office and I liked him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=181.04s)]
*  And every single person in Hollywood, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=183.68s)]
*  from my ex-wife to my mother-in-law [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=186.2s)]
*  to my manager at that time to my so-called friends [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  slash handlers around me, told me, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=194.12s)]
*  like if I said that I liked Trump, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=196.44s)]
*  that my career would be over, that my life would be over. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=198.32s)]
*  They said stuff like people get killed [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=202.86s)]
*  for wearing a hat like that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=204.38000000000002s)]
*  They threaten my life. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=205.46s)]
*  They basically said that I would be killed [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=207.18s)]
*  for wearing the hat. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  I had someone call me last night and said anybody wearing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=215.5s)]
*  a White Lives Matter shirt is gonna be green lit [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=220.18s)]
*  and that means that they're gonna beat him up [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  if they wear it and I'm like, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=225.74s)]
*  you know, okay, green light meeting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=227.62s)]
*  You know, God builds warriors in a different way. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=230.26s)]
*  I don't know if it's because of me being born in Atlanta [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  and growing up on the South Side of Chicago [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=240.06s)]
*  that he made me for such a time like this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=241.77999999999997s)]
*  It's like with David, he tended to the sheep [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  but while he was out there, he had to fight [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=250.1s)]
*  all kinds of animals. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  So when it was time for Goliath to come, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=253.98s)]
*  he thought because he was a sheep herder [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=256.14s)]
*  that he didn't have the skill set to take down Goliath [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=258.22s)]
*  and the thing that I have is the position I have, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=262.22s)]
*  my heart, but the number one thing is we have God [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=264.98s)]
*  on our side and for the people, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=267.94s)]
*  even if you don't believe in God, God believes in you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=270.22s)]
*  So you made reference to the White Lives Matter t-shirt [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=273.56s)]
*  you brought out at Paris Fashion Week. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=276.02s)]
*  Why did you do that and what did it mean? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=279.42s)]
*  I do certain things from a feeling. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=286.3s)]
*  I just channeled the energy, it just feels right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=288.98s)]
*  It's using a gut instinct, a connection with God [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=292.74s)]
*  and just brilliance. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=298.86s)]
*  As if you asked Tanya Harding how she did the triple flip [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=301.58s)]
*  or the triple spin, she was in so much practice [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=308.14s)]
*  that when it was time for her to skate [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=311.26s)]
*  in a competitive format, it just happened. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=315.06s)]
*  Like it happened outside of practice, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=319.14s)]
*  it happened in the real format [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  and that's what's happening is God is preparing us [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  for the real battles and we are in a battle with the media. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  The majority of the media has a godless agenda [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=332.82s)]
*  and the jokes in that work and this whole like, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  oh yeah, he's crazy and all these things, they don't work [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  because the media has, they've also watched travesties [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=343.5s)]
*  happen, just even specifically to me [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=348.7s)]
*  and just watch it and act like it wasn't happening [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=351.06s)]
*  and they stay quiet about it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=354.66s)]
*  What have they been doing? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=358.02s)]
*  I wanna answer the white, I felt like someone caught [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=359.7s)]
*  what I was saying, the comparison of Tanya Harding [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=363.06s)]
*  about the White Lives Matter. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=365.1s)]
*  My dad is an educated, ex-black panther [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=367.5s)]
*  and he put a text to me today, he said, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=373.14s)]
*  White Lives Matter, ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=375.82s)]
*  And I said, I thought the shirt was a funny shirt, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=378.26s)]
*  I thought the idea of me wearing it was funny [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=383.26s)]
*  and I said, dad, what do you think was funny? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=385.58s)]
*  He said, just a black man stating the obvious. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=387.82s)]
*  And my dad doesn't listen to rap music [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=394.76s)]
*  and he's super educated, we opened up a water distribution [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=399.42s)]
*  center in the Dominican Republic together, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=404.58000000000004s)]
*  he's like the original Steve Jobs, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=407.5s)]
*  but he was getting blocked every which way [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=409.46000000000004s)]
*  with all of his ideas and he didn't have [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=413.12s)]
*  an endless bank account and he didn't have Instagram, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=416.1s)]
*  so all these ideas, he had to take them back [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=419.18s)]
*  and compress them, like my dad is the most brilliant person [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=422.14s)]
*  that I know and we actually have a strained relationship [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=426.62s)]
*  because I was taken from him because my mom was an actress [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=429.94s)]
*  so she was a liberal and my dad would see certain things [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=435.18s)]
*  and say, we should do it this way, we should do it that way [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=439.94s)]
*  and the people got around my mom and pulled her away, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  much like Kim is a Christian but she has people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=447.02s)]
*  who want her to go to Interview Magazine [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=450.54s)]
*  and put her ass out while she's a 40 something year old [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=453.05999999999995s)]
*  multi-billionaire with four black children [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=456.58s)]
*  and this is how fashion wants to, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=459.85999999999996s)]
*  how they wanna present her. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=464.11999999999995s)]
*  So I know you give these questions [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=465.94s)]
*  and I give you these three part answers, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=468.17999999999995s)]
*  is this a cool format for you? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=471.82s)]
*  And I am following it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=472.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=473.58s)]
*  So you said that your father said [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=474.61999999999995s)]
*  when he saw the shirt White Lives Matter, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=477.58s)]
*  it's great to see a black man stating the obvious. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  So by which I think you meant that's obviously true. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=481.94s)]
*  Yeah, that my favorite response [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=485.58s)]
*  because I kept on thinking like, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=487.06s)]
*  you know, people, they're looking for explanation [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=488.38s)]
*  and people say, well, as an artist, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=491.02s)]
*  you don't have to give an explanation [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=493.74s)]
*  but as a leader, you do. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=496.56s)]
*  Yes, I think that's right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=497.94s)]
*  So the answer to why I wrote White Lives Matter [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=500.34s)]
*  on a shirt is because they do. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=505.62s)]
*  It's the obvious thing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=508.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=509.86s)]
*  Why do you think that's so, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=511.53999999999996s)]
*  and I assume the implications of course, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=514.42s)]
*  all lives matter because they're lives [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=515.8199999999999s)]
*  because God created them. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=517.18s)]
*  Why do you think that that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=518.62s)]
*  would be considered controversial? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=519.66s)]
*  Because the same people that have stripped us [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=526.74s)]
*  of our identity and labeled us as a color [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=531.52s)]
*  have told us what it means to be black [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=535.38s)]
*  and the vernacular that we're supposed to have. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=538.4599999999999s)]
*  My dad grew up as a military brat [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  and his family moved around [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=550.5s)]
*  but they were based mostly in Delaware. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=552.54s)]
*  And at the time, if he wasn't, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=556.02s)]
*  if they weren't the only black family, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=559.14s)]
*  they were one of the few [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=560.78s)]
*  and he would be discriminated against because he was black. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=562.54s)]
*  So by the time he got into college, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=566.82s)]
*  he would be discriminated against. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=571.46s)]
*  He went to a black college, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=574.1s)]
*  he would be discriminated against [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=575.0200000000001s)]
*  because they said he talked too white. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=576.6600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=578.5s)]
*  And then he played the kick drum in the band. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=579.34s)]
*  So when he would go to the club [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=582.88s)]
*  and the music was playing, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=585.1s)]
*  where would he clap his hands? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  Where the kick drum is. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=588.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=590.22s)]
*  So it's the opposite of where everyone else [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  was clapping their hands. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=591.9000000000001s)]
*  And this is the most elegant and tasteful person [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=594.5799999999999s)]
*  that I know. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=600.8199999999999s)]
*  And when my mom, when the school suggests [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  they're like the hurting systems [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=610.18s)]
*  because what they do is take the black community [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=611.38s)]
*  and they separate us and they separate the families [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=614.6999999999999s)]
*  and the educated, they push this need for us [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=618.18s)]
*  for higher education and us as blacks, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=623.66s)]
*  we discriminate against each other and say, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=626.14s)]
*  well, I got my PhD and you don't have your PhD, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=627.9s)]
*  so I'm better than you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=630.18s)]
*  And so my mom, she had a PhD [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  and she was influenced to move to the South Side of Chicago [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=634.42s)]
*  and take this job at Chicago State University. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=639.1s)]
*  And she told my dad, if you come for us, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=642.26s)]
*  you'll never see him again. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  Because the media ridiculed me [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=648.78s)]
*  for getting the house next door to Kim to see my children. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=650.82s)]
*  And they even said that I was stalking her [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=655.98s)]
*  and her new boyfriend because I bought the house next door [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=658.22s)]
*  to see my children. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=662.34s)]
*  And that's how I knew that my mom had said that to him. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=663.82s)]
*  I said, dad, they moved us to one of the most, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=668.3000000000001s)]
*  agreed upon to be one of the most dangerous places [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=672.6600000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=675.2600000000001s)]
*  It's almost like they tried to kill me or something. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=676.1s)]
*  I said, dad, why did you never come to get us? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=679.02s)]
*  And that's when he told me that she was told that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=684.4599999999999s)]
*  So many things that are put in Kim's head, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=689.1s)]
*  they bring influencers. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=692.66s)]
*  No one ever know where Corey Gamble came from. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=694.5s)]
*  No one in the fashion world knows where Gabby came from. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=698.22s)]
*  These people were practically made in a laboratory, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=702.26s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=705.18s)]
*  And one of the things that they're really good at doing [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=706.74s)]
*  is being nice and being likable. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=709.54s)]
*  And what they do is for people that have some form [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=713.26s)]
*  of influence, whether it's an educated black woman [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=717.8s)]
*  like my mother that became the head of the English department [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=721.26s)]
*  at Chicago State University, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=724.78s)]
*  or whether it's the most influential white woman [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=726.58s)]
*  on the planet, being my ex-wife, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=731.46s)]
*  they have people that are around them at all times [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=734.62s)]
*  telling them what to be afraid of. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=738.46s)]
*  It's like not what to do or say specifically, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=740.9000000000001s)]
*  it's what to be afraid of. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=742.9200000000001s)]
*  And if you have a person that isn't afraid of them, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=744.62s)]
*  like a Russell Brand or Candace Owen, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=750.94s)]
*  it's not that we have to agree with this, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=755.62s)]
*  but they're not afraid. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=758.26s)]
*  They're not afraid to state what their opinion is. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=759.9000000000001s)]
*  No one is God and everyone has an opinion. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=763.38s)]
*  So a conversation like this is a window into a world [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=768.54s)]
*  that you don't see. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=773.14s)]
*  So if you're familiar with West from the media, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=774.18s)]
*  you think of him as an individual man. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=779.22s)]
*  What you don't think about is that he is at the center [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=781.22s)]
*  of a battle and people like him are at the center [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=783.74s)]
*  of a battle to get a message out. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=785.78s)]
*  Mouthed by the lips of influencers like him [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCJHxv4jMA&t=789.74s)]
