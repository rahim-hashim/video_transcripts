# Jon Voight: I've been speaking out for quite a while
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw)
*  Initially, when I was speaking out or taking a stand, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=0.0s)]
*  I made this major mistake. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=4.84s)]
*  So I didn't speak out for a long time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=6.8s)]
*  But then I started to realize it's necessary. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=9.0s)]
*  Somebody's got to stand up and say a few things. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=11.44s)]
*  And I've been speaking out for quite a while now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=14.14s)]
*  and making my place in support of the good and the sane. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  And what kind of reaction did you get? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=27.78s)]
*  Well, many people are upset with me in the Hollywood group, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=31.46s)]
*  and family, too. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=39.18s)]
*  But no one really confronts me because they [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=41.22s)]
*  don't have the answers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=47.3s)]
*  They fear my knowledge in a certain sense, like yourself. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=49.34s)]
*  You've got too many facts, too much information, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=55.06s)]
*  and you're too eloquent to be argued with. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  And so people get to a certain level. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=60.86s)]
*  If somebody says something to me, and I say, well, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  do you want to talk about it? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=65.62s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=66.42s)]
*  Come on, my camper will talk. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=67.14s)]
*  And we sit down and say, well, do you know this? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=68.78s)]
*  Do you know this? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  And then about a minute in, they say, you know, John, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=73.38s)]
*  I really don't know too much about this stuff. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  And they leave. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=78.7s)]
*  But I want to judge you anyway. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=79.66s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=82.9s)]
*  The people who don't want to know things, you know, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=85.34s)]
*  and it were people who want to follow. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=88.5s)]
*  They want to follow because obviously their careers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=91.26s)]
*  are on their minds. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=96.62s)]
*  They think that their careers are going to be heard [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=97.84s)]
*  if they know too much about, if they know too much against what [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=99.54s)]
*  the current flavor is, you know, of thought. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  But it's too bad. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=112.34s)]
*  I've seen the schools being overtaken in my life, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=115.54s)]
*  the teachers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  There are no great teachers, it seems anymore. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  There are. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  But boy, there are few and far between, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=124.66s)]
*  the ones that are able to stand up to what's going on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=128.4s)]
*  And in our colleges, unbelievable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=131.54s)]
*  But of course, I know enough to know that this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=135.46s)]
*  didn't happen accidentally. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=139.62s)]
*  This didn't happen because a lot of people just got dulled. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=141.26s)]
*  It happened because there were forces [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=146.1s)]
*  that wanted to propagandize, wanted to bring us around, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=148.22s)]
*  wanted to attack America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1y61nodfw&t=152.02s)]
