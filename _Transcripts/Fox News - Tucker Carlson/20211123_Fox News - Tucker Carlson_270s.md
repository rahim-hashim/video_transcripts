# Kyle Rittenhouse tells Tucker why he lost faith in the justice system
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4)
*  Every shot that Kyle Rittenhouse fired in Kenosha in August of 2020 was caught on videotape. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=0.0s)]
*  That's why he's a framer tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=8.88s)]
*  There was never any doubt once you looked at the tape that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=9.88s)]
*  self-defense. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=12.94s)]
*  But for political reasons, prosecutors in Kenosha ignored the evidence and they charged [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=13.94s)]
*  Rittenhouse with murder and threw him in jail for more than 80 days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=17.6s)]
*  Then they hid evidence from the defense. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=20.94s)]
*  It's an appalling, appalling example of prosecutorial misconduct. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=22.76s)]
*  We asked Rittenhouse about that during our conversation last night. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=27.2s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=29.92s)]
*  What did you think of the prosecution? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=30.92s)]
*  In my belief, the prosecutorial misconduct in this case is ridiculous. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=37.24s)]
*  They knew I was innocent, but they still decided to bring these charges to make their name, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=43.72s)]
*  to have a name. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=49.6s)]
*  They wanted my head on their shelf. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=50.6s)]
*  There's this FBI surveillance plane. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=52.56s)]
*  It is illegal to surveil U.S. citizens, but the FBI still had a plane up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=56.6s)]
*  They tried to twist it and say I was chasing down Mr. Rosenbaum. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=62.68s)]
*  Never happened. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=67.42s)]
*  The funny thing is, we were not provided that drone footage until October and they had it [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  way before and the FBI gave it to them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=77.5s)]
*  They compressed that FBI drone video and gave it to us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=80.16s)]
*  They gave us a compressed version of that file. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=84.48s)]
*  They had a 4K drone that showed the shooting of Mr. Rosenbaum. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  Do you know what handbrake is? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=95.84s)]
*  No. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=97.64s)]
*  Assistant District Attorney Cross had a software installed on his computer called handbrake. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=98.64s)]
*  This is just speculation, but put two and two together, we get a decompressed 3, I think [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=105.56s)]
*  it's 3 megabyte file of the drone video when they have an 11 megabyte and he has handbrake [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=111.0s)]
*  installed on his computer. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=117.04s)]
*  We got an extremely decompressed version of the drone video. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=121.44s)]
*  In a normal trial, that would be grounds for a mistrial right there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=127.52s)]
*  You have to be provided the same evidence that the prosecution is provided by definition. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=130.8s)]
*  Another very, very, very disgrace in this government is with the FBI drone, they called [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=136.92s)]
*  the camera operator of that drone to testify. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  ADA Binger asked his questions and then Attorney Mark Richards, great attorney, phenomenal [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  attorney, asked his questions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=154.56s)]
*  He asked about the tail number, the state objected and they said he had a 2-way letter [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=157.2s)]
*  from the state attorney and we weren't able to ask him the tail number so we can submit [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=162.56s)]
*  our FOIA request, which are still being appealed right now so we can get the complete version [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=168.76s)]
*  of that night on the drone video. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=173.24s)]
*  He wouldn't give us the tail number. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=176.32s)]
*  We weren't able to ask him what the tail number was because of the 2-way letter that we got [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  the day he testified that supposedly disappeared from Natalie Wisco, another great attorney's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=185.2s)]
*  email. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=192.34s)]
*  It just completely magically disappeared from her email because the state said they emailed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=193.34s)]
*  it but we never got it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=197.22s)]
*  So dirty. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=199.3s)]
*  What do you think motivated Binger? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=200.74s)]
*  Assistant District Attorney Binger is a corrupt person who just wants to make a name for himself [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=203.86s)]
*  and not look at the facts. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=209.86s)]
*  I used to be a fan of the prosecutors, not anymore. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=211.94s)]
*  I believe there's still good prosecuting attorneys out there but he is a prosecuting attorney [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=215.22000000000003s)]
*  that wants to make a name for himself and he's supposed to speak the truth and nothing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=220.14s)]
*  but the truth but he decided he wanted to lie and try to put me in prison for the rest [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  of my life for defending myself. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=230.77999999999997s)]
*  I mean that must be shocking for you as a kid to realize the system can destroy someone [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=232.94s)]
*  who they know doesn't deserve to be destroyed just for political reasons. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=241.22s)]
*  It's sickening because this is a case that never had, that shouldn't have, this is a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=245.82s)]
*  case that has nothing to do with politics but politics were brought into it for people's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=250.38s)]
*  own agenda. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y32GhnEHY4&t=255.85999999999999s)]
