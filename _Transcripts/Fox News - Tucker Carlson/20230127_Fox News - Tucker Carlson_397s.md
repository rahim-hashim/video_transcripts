# Larry Kudlow: What we have here is Biden with a big lie
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU)
*  And now with more Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=0.0s)]
*  Larry, great to have you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=2.46s)]
*  The first thing that people need to understand [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=4.34s)]
*  is this problem with the death ceiling is not imminent. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=6.5s)]
*  We're looking at May or June [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=10.76s)]
*  before it really becomes a significant issue. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=12.84s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy rightly has been trying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=15.88s)]
*  to negotiate with Joe Biden. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=18.38s)]
*  Joe Biden has said no to those negotiations, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=20.28s)]
*  the very opposite of what he said in 2011 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  when they came up with the Deficit Reduction Act [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  and sequestration followed that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=30.76s)]
*  So the question is why won't Joe now negotiate? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=33.2s)]
*  Does he think the Republicans won't unite [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=37.08s)]
*  behind Kevin McCarthy? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=39.2s)]
*  Does he think he's able to break the Republican coalition? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=40.32s)]
*  Because I can predict tonight [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=43.6s)]
*  after talking to many factions in the Republican Party, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  that's not gonna happen, they're gonna be together. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=47.58s)]
*  Well, Sean, you know, it's very important. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  Biden and Schumer and Jeffries, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=54.68s)]
*  they're all giving us this big lie. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=60.72s)]
*  Here's the big lie. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=63.88s)]
*  The Republicans are gonna cut into Social Security. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=65.86s)]
*  The Republicans are gonna cut Medicare. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=70.48s)]
*  The Republicans are gonna default on the debt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=73.52s)]
*  It is a complete lie. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=77.12s)]
*  Sean, this week in recent days, today and two days ago, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=79.48s)]
*  I interviewed Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Today I interviewed Majority Leader Steve Scalise. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  They both said emphatically, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=91.4s)]
*  they're not going after Social Security, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  they're not going after Medicare, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=96.48s)]
*  and they will make good on the government debt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=98.4s)]
*  So what you got here is Biden with this big lie. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=101.64s)]
*  You know, this is what authoritarians do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=104.56s)]
*  This is what totalitarians do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=107.18s)]
*  They say something that's not true, they keep repeating it, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=109.56s)]
*  and they hope that somehow it's gonna become true. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=113.4s)]
*  McCarthy's too smart for this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=116.56s)]
*  Scalise is too smart for this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=118.64s)]
*  Probably the country's too smart for this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=120.86s)]
*  The basic point here is the Democrats will do anything, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=123.56s)]
*  Sean, not to cut spending. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=127.92s)]
*  And right now, spending and the bloated size of government [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=131.28s)]
*  is the single biggest problem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=136.08s)]
*  It is the single biggest obstacle [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=138.96s)]
*  to economic growth and prosperity. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=141.84s)]
*  Middle income folks are getting killed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=144.24s)]
*  This is just crazy, this big lie. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=146.32s)]
*  And they're just denying it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=149.24s)]
*  I mean, I've been playing it on my show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=150.52s)]
*  The leaders of the Republican House are not gonna do it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  And Biden's just going out with this baloney and malarkey. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=158.36s)]
*  It's like some totalitarian dictator. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=162.24s)]
*  96% debt to GDP ratio right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=165.28s)]
*  That is almost a mathematical certainty [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=168.96s)]
*  that inflation will continue [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=172.8s)]
*  and will continue with a bad economy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=174.12s)]
*  But I wanna take you back to 2011. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=176.12s)]
*  Joe Biden, comments he made on debt ceiling negotiations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=178.72s)]
*  Now he's saying no negotiations. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=183.12s)]
*  How can you explain the fact that grown men and women [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=185.16s)]
*  are unwilling to budge up until now, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=187.32s)]
*  and still some of them are still unwilling to budge [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=189.66s)]
*  by taking an absolute position, my way or no way? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=192.26000000000002s)]
*  That's not governing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=195.56s)]
*  That's no way to govern. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=196.88s)]
*  You can't govern that way. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=198.38s)]
*  This is a cycle. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=200.62s)]
*  I predict to you that a lot of those new members [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=201.66s)]
*  who came here with my way or the highway, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=205.1s)]
*  they'll either be on the highway [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=207.7s)]
*  or learn that they're gonna have to compromise. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  So I am betting, and I think the Democratic Party [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=211.54s)]
*  is betting on that the Republican Party in the House [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=214.34s)]
*  will not stick together. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=217.46s)]
*  I have spoken to all of the top players [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  that I think are gonna have a key role in all of this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=222.01999999999998s)]
*  They've all said the same thing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  They will unite around a position. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=227.08s)]
*  There's about 15 different plans being tossed around. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=230.56s)]
*  They're all dealing with spending, and they'll agree. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=233.36s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=235.52s)]
*  What's yours? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=236.44s)]
*  Well, I basically agree. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=239.0s)]
*  Look, the position that Biden, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=240.56s)]
*  that he's not gonna negotiate, cannot hold. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  All right, Republicans will stick together. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, they're gonna get some Democratic support [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=247.72000000000003s)]
*  in the House and even in the Senate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=250.62s)]
*  Look, to raise the debt ceiling, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=253.76s)]
*  they're gonna have to have budget cuts. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=257.2s)]
*  Otherwise, we're gonna continue with this inflation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=260.44s)]
*  and we're gonna continue with what looks like a recession. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=263.64s)]
*  Today's GDP number was really a lousy number [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  when you look under the hood. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, go back to 2011, Sean, I like that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=271.88s)]
*  John Boehner toughed it out with Barack Obama, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=274.78s)]
*  and Boehner got spending caps, okay? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=279.68s)]
*  Boehner got a reduction in overall spending. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=283.26000000000005s)]
*  Boehner stopped tax hikes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=286.42s)]
*  Barack Obama started out, you know, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=288.66s)]
*  arrogantly not negotiating. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=291.06s)]
*  Boehner succeeded, okay? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  I think that Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=294.94000000000005s)]
*  and the others will also succeed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=298.66s)]
*  I actually think they're gonna get some help [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=301.24s)]
*  from the Senate this time around. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=303.06s)]
*  But the crazy point is, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  the government is spending 24% of our economy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=307.54s)]
*  If you go to the states and the localities, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=311.62s)]
*  federal, state and local, 44% of our economy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's why you're getting for all 22. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=319.1s)]
*  You just got the last numbers today. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=322.1s)]
*  The economy grew at 1%, Sean. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=324.38s)]
*  That's the worst performance [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=328.16s)]
*  since the financial meltdown in 2008 and 2009. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=329.98s)]
*  The inflation rate for the whole year was 6.3%. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=334.58s)]
*  That is the highest inflation in 40 years. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=339.04s)]
*  What's the culprit here? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=342.36s)]
*  Five to $6 trillion of spending and borrowing, okay? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=344.36s)]
*  And then student debt cancellations [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  could add another 6, 800 billion. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=353.12s)]
*  So no, you're right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=355.32000000000005s)]
*  There will be negotiations. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=357.38s)]
*  The GOP is not gonna destroy the big entitlement programs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=359.36s)]
*  The GOP will make good on the debt. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=363.68s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  They will insist on spending cuts, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=367.56s)]
*  on new caps for future spending. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=371.52s)]
*  And they'll also have the penalty [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=374.56s)]
*  of across the board sequester, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  across the board automatic cuts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=378.5s)]
*  This is coming. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=380.71999999999997s)]

*  Larry Kudlow, always great to have you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=394.4s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC50UmeCBqU&t=395.94s)]
