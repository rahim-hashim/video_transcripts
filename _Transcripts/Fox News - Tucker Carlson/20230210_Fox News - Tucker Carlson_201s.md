# Tucker: Don Lemon is on the brink
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg)
*  We will concede we have spent many happy years making fun of Mr. Don Lamon of CNN, and at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=0.0s)]
*  times we'll concede we've been a little cruel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=6.0s)]
*  But as we have mocked him, and we have, there has been honestly an undercurrent of real [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=8.9s)]
*  affection. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=14.16s)]
*  We kind of admire Don Lamon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=15.16s)]
*  How can a man so obviously limited have such boundless self-esteem? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=16.8s)]
*  Doesn't he know he's an idiot? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=20.56s)]
*  No. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=22.6s)]
*  He has no idea. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=23.6s)]
*  This is the guy who once suggested that a commercial airliner had been eaten by a black [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=24.6s)]
*  hole. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=28.28s)]
*  When people laughed at him, he seemed completely unbothered by their laughter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=29.28s)]
*  In a world of intellectual pretense, Don Lamon is not ashamed of being dumb, or for that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=33.32s)]
*  matter ashamed of anything else. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=37.72s)]
*  When he got fired last year from his primetime gig for low ratings and reassigned to mornings, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=39.6s)]
*  he told viewers it was a promotion and he seemed to mean it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=44.28s)]
*  So whatever else you say about Mr. Don Lamon, he is unflappable, or so we assumed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=47.92s)]
*  It turns out there is in fact one thing that bothers Don Lamon, and that's not being the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=54.06s)]
*  prettiest person on the set. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=58.64s)]
*  That drives him insane. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  So possibly as a kind of torture, a kind of punishment, CNN's new president, Chris Licht, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=62.46s)]
*  paired Don Lamon with two much younger, much more attractive co-hosts, Kaitlyn Collins [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=66.84s)]
*  and Poppy Harlow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=71.86s)]
*  And the normally steely Don Lamon began to melt down before our very eyes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=73.8s)]
*  The other day, for example, after Kaitlyn Collins interviewed a Republican member of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=78.48s)]
*  Congress, Don Lamon launched into an attack on Republicans that wasn't actually an attack [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=82.52s)]
*  on Republicans, but a not so veiled attack on his co-host, Kaitlyn Collins. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  Producers in the control room turned up the music to get him to be quiet. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=94.1s)]
*  We're going to commercial now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=97.08s)]
*  But he shushed them to keep attacking her. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=98.96s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=101.38s)]
*  Thank you for taking time to join us. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=102.38s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=103.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=104.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=105.38s)]
*  That's going to be, that's the time that we're in where facts are sort of flexible. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=106.38s)]
*  That's why we got Kaitlyn Collins on the hill. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=113.38s)]
*  Facts checking in real time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=116.8s)]
*  It was a great interview. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=117.8s)]
*  Citing incredible sources, like citing the New York Post as a credible source and saying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  that facts are, it's just, I can't believe that we're here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=124.22s)]
*  Kaitlyn, that was a great interview. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=129.54s)]
*  Moving on. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=130.54s)]
*  Anyway, well, now moving on, because that's, listen, that's a big issue when it comes to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=131.54s)]
*  the American, hold on please with the music. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=137.1s)]
*  That's a big issue when it comes to the American people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=138.9s)]
*  American people are going to have to suffer through all of this stuff from election deniers [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=140.62s)]
*  to people who don't believe in facts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=146.82s)]
*  We don't have a shared reality. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=148.78s)]
*  And now it's taken center stage to people like Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=150.58s)]
*  This is Thanksgiving at the alcoholic passive aggressive family's house. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=154.56s)]
*  The American people shrieks Don LaMont, the American people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  Of course it's not about the American people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=161.9s)]
*  It's definitely not about quote facts, facts. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=164.58s)]
*  No. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=168.02s)]
*  It's about how Don LaMont feels about himself. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=169.14s)]
*  CNN president Chris Licht really ought to sit down with this guy over a few mango white [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=172.66s)]
*  claws and just let him know that just because somebody else is pretty doesn't mean that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=176.7s)]
*  you're ugly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=181.61999999999998s)]
*  It's okay Don, you're beautiful inside. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=183.17999999999998s)]
*  Or something. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=185.6s)]
*  Is it going to work? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=186.6s)]
*  We don't know, but they got to try something. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=187.6s)]
*  Don LaMont is on the brink. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULmupJHzMg&t=188.85999999999999s)]
