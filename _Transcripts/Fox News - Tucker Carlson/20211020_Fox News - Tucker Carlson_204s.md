# The left defunds the police in this sinister way: Fmr. Detroit police chief
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4)
*  James Craig knows a lot about running police departments. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's run several. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  He's the most recently the police chief [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=3.24s)]
*  of the city of Detroit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=5.16s)]
*  He's now running for governor of Michigan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=6.08s)]
*  He joins us with a reaction to these mandates [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=8.28s)]
*  and the effect they're having in public safety. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=11.08s)]
*  Chief, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=12.6s)]
*  So what effect do you think these are gonna have [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=14.08s)]
*  on the public, on people who wanna go to the grocery store [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=17.04s)]
*  without being shot, for example? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=19.96s)]
*  You know, Tucker, first let me start by saying [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=22.84s)]
*  how much I appreciate you having me on your show, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=25.28s)]
*  but it's just utterly ridiculous. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=27.48s)]
*  We're talking about a mayor who wanted to defund the police [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=30.28s)]
*  so her wish is coming true in Chicago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=34.96s)]
*  This is in effect defunding the police. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=38.52s)]
*  It's reckless and she does not speak for people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=41.52s)]
*  who live in vulnerable communities, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=45.32s)]
*  whether it's there, Seattle, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=47.56s)]
*  and let's talk about Seattle, the summer of love. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=49.32s)]
*  That mayor, she wanted to defund the police. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=52.08s)]
*  They're getting their wish. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  And they don't have any concept of how to reduce violence [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=58.32s)]
*  in their city. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=62.12s)]
*  It's reckless, it's irresponsible, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=63.92s)]
*  and folks who are on the left, who are complicit, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=66.84s)]
*  who say nothing, they're as involved. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=71.36s)]
*  I'm not gonna say it, it's wrong. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=74.32s)]
*  Well, I think you're exactly right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=75.84s)]
*  If you take all the police away and the murder rate spikes, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=78.2s)]
*  maybe you stop taking police away. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=80.84s)]
*  I have to ask you, you ran the police department, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=83.24s)]
*  you've dealt with unions, where are the unions here? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=86.08s)]
*  I thought the unions were supposed to be strong. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=88.28s)]
*  I noticed they shake down taxpayers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=90.0s)]
*  Why aren't they protecting their own members, honestly? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=91.36s)]
*  Well, it depends on where you're talking. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=95.16s)]
*  I gotta give the Chicago Union president a lot of credit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=96.64s)]
*  Good. He stepped up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=102.32s)]
*  His mayor referred to him as a racist. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=103.6s)]
*  The mayor and a judge referred to him [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=106.52s)]
*  as being an insurrectionist, and that's wrong. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=109.4s)]
*  There's something called collective bargaining. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=113.7s)]
*  Collective bargaining. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  Why don't you bring the union and this city to the table, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=119.34s)]
*  and let's see what we can do to work this out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=122.9s)]
*  These men and women wanna do the job, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=125.42s)]
*  but when you do what Lori Lightfoot did, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=128.58s)]
*  that's not leadership. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=134.54s)]
*  That's not leadership at all, Tucker, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=136.22s)]
*  and I gotta tell you, but this is all by design. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=137.9s)]
*  It's not by accident. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=142.42s)]
*  And then she pulls out the race card and said, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=144.22s)]
*  what he's doing is racist. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=146.94s)]
*  How is this racist? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, really, what's racist is the people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  who live in vulnerable communities, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  who are impacted by these bad decisions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=155.34s)]
*  or by these reckless mayors [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=158.54s)]
*  who need to just step down and resign. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=161.38s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=163.54s)]
*  And I gotta tell you, Tucker, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=164.38s)]
*  that's why I'm running for governor, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  because I'm not gonna sit back and watch this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=167.7s)]
*  That's why your viewers can go to chiefjamescraig.com [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=170.5s)]
*  and say, we want change. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=173.94s)]
*  This is about leadership, leading from the front. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=175.58s)]
*  Man, you need change in that state, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=178.18s)]
*  the great state of Michigan. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=180.06s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=181.3s)]
*  I can go on all night. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=182.5s)]
*  We have. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=184.66s)]
*  Chief, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=185.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=186.74s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=189.38s)]
*  Appreciate you, Tucker. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=190.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=191.46s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiD8KefFP4&t=200.5s)]
