# Bannon on Trump raid: 'This is about pure power politics'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA)
*  Steve Bannon has experienced the weaponization of the justice system firsthand. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the former White House chief strategist. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=4.0s)]
*  He has been targeted relentlessly by the January 6th committee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=6.32s)]
*  He joins us now by phone to react to news of the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=10.24s)]
*  Steve, happy to have you on the program, have you by phone here tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=15.72s)]
*  What's your immediate reaction? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=20.28s)]
*  Well, well, you know, I gave this speech, a keynote address, at the Kettleman's Balt [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=21.28s)]
*  Sea Pack on Friday night. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=25.88s)]
*  I said, we're at war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  We're at a political and ideological war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=28.56s)]
*  And they've obviously weaponized the Justice Department. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=30.84s)]
*  And this had to be approved by Ron Klain. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  This had to go up to the White House to be approved. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=36.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=39.2s)]
*  Anybody saying it didn't is a liar. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=40.2s)]
*  This had to go up to Cheney Klan, through Merrick Garland, to Ron Klain at least, and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Ray and these guys. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=47.56s)]
*  But look, here's the thing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=48.56s)]
*  This is about pure power politics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  They're absolutely scared to death about Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=52.84s)]
*  Mark Elias, the guy who laid out the entire effort to steal the 2020 election, the transition [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=55.16s)]
*  to Terry Barger, he's tweeting right now all the U.S. code about documents and making sure [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=61.08s)]
*  you can't run for federal office again. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=67.16s)]
*  They're absolutely petrified Trump's going to announce in the next couple of weeks, win [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=68.8s)]
*  the Republican nomination, win the White House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=72.12s)]
*  Now here's what's incumbent upon everybody. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=74.64s)]
*  The House leaders right now need to step up and recommit Jim Jordan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=76.84s)]
*  Full investigation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=81.28s)]
*  They're cutting off appropriations to the FBI to get to the bottom of this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=82.28s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=85.24s)]
*  This is going to continue on. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=86.24s)]
*  The FBI right now is the Gestapo. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=88.16s)]
*  The FBI is the Gestapo, whether it's out in Colorado putting a Gold Star mother like King [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=91.56s)]
*  of Peters in chains, Peter Navarro in chains. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=95.8s)]
*  It's absolutely obscene. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  This is an obscenity. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to have to fight fire with fire. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  The way to do it is win elections, win them overwhelmingly, and then use the appropriations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=104.28s)]
*  process to choke down the FBI and choke down the Justice Department and get to the bottom [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=108.8s)]
*  of who approved this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=113.56s)]
*  This is so outrageous. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=114.56s)]
*  It needs to be investigated. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=115.56s)]
*  You know, Steve, I want to ask you this question, Steve. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=116.56s)]
*  You know, I'm familiar with your point of view. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=121.8s)]
*  I'm familiar with the opinions you share on War Room. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=124.88s)]
*  I'm familiar with how deep you fear the corruption has run within the United States of America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=127.24s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=132.04s)]
*  I said this earlier in the program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=133.04s)]
*  The place in which we sit today in the United States of America is a very optimistic point [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=136.04s)]
*  of view because this corruption, if it is partisan corruption, isn't relegated to the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=141.44s)]
*  FBI. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=147.2s)]
*  We saw 87,000 new IRS agents have been hired. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=148.2s)]
*  You can look at almost any federal institution, including the intelligence community, who [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  dismissed Hunter Biden's laptop as disinformation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=153.28s)]
*  And you can say to yourself, this isn't one apparatus. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=156.18s)]
*  This is not one department. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=158.92s)]
*  This is not one election. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=160.44s)]
*  Our problem is deeper. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, you're 100% correct. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=164.72s)]
*  This is not a corruption. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=165.72s)]
*  Let's say that's not a corruption. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=166.72s)]
*  This is about the administrative state. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=168.56s)]
*  This is about an undemocratic apparatus, bigger than the arc. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=170.4s)]
*  This is the administrative state, and they want to run things their own way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=173.48s)]
*  And they want to pick and choose who actually runs and who actually wins. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=176.56s)]
*  This is why it's incumbent upon—look, we have two-thirds of the nations in back of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=179.76s)]
*  us, Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=184.68s)]
*  It's now time to take control of the House of Representatives with an overwhelming victory [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=187.28s)]
*  and then act like we mean it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  The Jim Jordans and people have to step up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=193.84s)]
*  And Kevin McCarthy has to step up and say, we're going to have full investigations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=195.84s)]
*  We're going to choke them down, appropriation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=199.4s)]
*  Listen, we— [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=200.64s)]
*  I got it, Steve. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=201.84s)]
*  This is a non-democratic— [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=202.6s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=204.28s)]
*  I hate to cut you off, Steve. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=205.48s)]
*  We have more information coming in as we speak, so I got to get to that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=206.48s)]
*  Steve, it's great to hear from you tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XU6SnVa0zA&t=209.64s)]
