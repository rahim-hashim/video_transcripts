# Tucker: This is a real problem, it isn't temporary
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Tuesday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=2.2s)]
*  There's probably no institution in American life [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=3.12s)]
*  that has more effect on how you live, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  but that we talk about less than the Federal Reserve. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=8.18s)]
*  People don't care to talk about the Federal Reserve [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=11.3s)]
*  because it seems very complex. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=13.5s)]
*  And a lot of what it does is in fact complex, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=15.48s)]
*  unless you have a grounding in monetary policy, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=17.54s)]
*  it's hard to know exactly what's going on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=19.5s)]
*  But the basics aren't that complicated actually. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=21.82s)]
*  And here are a few of them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=23.94s)]
*  The Federal Reserve was created way back in 1913 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=25.2s)]
*  by an act of Congress. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=27.82s)]
*  And it had really two main goals. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=28.94s)]
*  Maximize employment and keep prices stable, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=31.12s)]
*  keep inflation under control. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=34.24s)]
*  Those are virtuous goals. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=36.56s)]
*  But it may be a measure of the way that bureaucracies work [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=39.06s)]
*  that over time the Federal Reserve has actively undermined [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=41.7s)]
*  both of those objectives. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=45.42s)]
*  It's the classic story of the fireman turned arsonist [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=47.14s)]
*  or for that matter, the COVID czar [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  who helped create COVID. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=51.5s)]
*  Irony of irony, seems like we read a lot of those lately. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=53.32s)]
*  In the case of the Federal Reserve, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=56.22s)]
*  consider something called quantitative easing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=57.46s)]
*  That's the main thing the Fed has been doing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=59.54s)]
*  since the financial crisis of 2008. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=61.3s)]
*  Every month, Federal Reserve officials [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  print more than a hundred billion new dollars [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=65.98s)]
*  in American currency. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=68.66s)]
*  And then they inject those dollars [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=70.06s)]
*  into our financial system by buying assets [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  like bonds and securities. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=73.64s)]
*  This is not a normal thing to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=76.18s)]
*  It's a radical thing to do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=77.42s)]
*  And it was supposed to be temporary. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=79.06s)]
*  It was in response to a crisis. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=80.62s)]
*  In medical terms, quantitative easing is like chemotherapy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=82.9s)]
*  There are times when it can save your life, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=86.6s)]
*  but fundamentally it's poison. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=88.78s)]
*  If you keep taking it, it will kill you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  Pretty much everyone agrees on that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=92.94s)]
*  And pretty much everyone understands [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  that ultimately quantitative easing causes horrible inflation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=96.08s)]
*  And it's easy to understand why. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=100.08s)]
*  You don't need to be an expert. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=101.52s)]
*  The more money you print, the less that money is worth. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=103.22s)]
*  It's supply and demand. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=106.88s)]
*  You buy diamonds by the carrot, but you buy dirt by the yard. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=108.28s)]
*  Overabundance decreases value. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=111.36s)]
*  So every new dollar you print buys less. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=114.88s)]
*  If you keep printing them, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=118.92s)]
*  you wind up devaluing your own currency. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=120.28s)]
*  That's one thing a responsible government should never do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  It may enrich banks and a tiny number of big investors [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=127.08s)]
*  who give to the democratic party, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=130.22s)]
*  but devaluing your currency screws everyone who works [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=131.6s)]
*  and who saves. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=134.42s)]
*  And that's immoral. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=135.82s)]
*  Those are exactly the people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=137.3s)]
*  that a legitimate government ought to be trying to help [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=138.8s)]
*  as its core mission. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=141.94s)]
*  And yet they're not. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=144.26s)]
*  All these years later, quantitative easing continues. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=145.42s)]
*  They're still doing it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=148.06s)]
*  On Wall Street, they joke about how it's gonna go on forever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=149.56s)]
*  They call it QE infinity. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  It's an incredibly reckless policy and everybody knows it, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=154.26s)]
*  very much including the people who are getting rich from it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=158.0s)]
*  So for the better part of a year, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  Fed officials have been promising [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=161.98s)]
*  they're gonna stop doing this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  They have sworn they will get sober. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=164.6s)]
*  They have vowed to begin a process called tapering. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=167.14s)]
*  That means they'll start to gradually slow [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  the money they print. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=172.18s)]
*  At a Fed meeting in April, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=174.58s)]
*  officials said they'd start to do this very soon. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  They would taper, but they never did. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  They made the same promise throughout this summer, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=179.72s)]
*  but again, they didn't. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  The binge continued. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  This morning, the vice chairman of the Fed, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  Richard Clarito, once again insisted [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=187.56s)]
*  that tapering is almost here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  We're about to do it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=191.06s)]
*  The conditions to begin detox, he said, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=192.94s)]
*  have all but been met. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=195.8s)]
*  And yet as of tonight, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=197.8s)]
*  the Fed is still partying with your currency [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  like this is the richest country in the world [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=200.96s)]
*  and always will be. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=202.6s)]
*  So what are the effects on our country of this? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=205.34s)]
*  Well, in the short term, as with vodka, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=208.24s)]
*  it makes everybody feel pretty good. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=210.64s)]
*  It's 3 a.m., your lips are numb and you can barely see. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=212.54s)]
*  And yet somehow the breakfast meeting downtown [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=215.18s)]
*  you've got in five hours, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=218.28s)]
*  when you're gonna have to give a detailed presentation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  to your boss, seems like no problem at all. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=221.32s)]
*  You've got this, except you don't have it at all. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=223.98s)]
*  Morning always comes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=227.86s)]
*  It is always worse than you think. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  America's quantitative easing hangover is going to be ugly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=232.18s)]
*  Beneath the manufactured euphoria [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=237.02s)]
*  of our top line economic numbers, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=238.32s)]
*  Google's killing it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=239.82s)]
*  Record profits for Amazon, says CNBC. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=240.88s)]
*  Beneath all of that garbage, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=244.02s)]
*  the actual American economy is in trouble [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=246.22s)]
*  and there are many signs of it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=249.02s)]
*  Labor markets are tight right now [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=250.66s)]
*  because a lot of Americans have simply dropped [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=252.1s)]
*  out of the labor force. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  4.3 million people walked off the job last month. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  Some of them were forced out [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=259.18s)]
*  by Joe Biden's vaccine mandates. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Projections for GDP growth just dropped [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=262.26000000000005s)]
*  from 6% to 1.5%. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=264.22s)]
*  Small businesses across the country are dying. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=267.3s)]
*  And maybe most ominous of all, inflation is here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=270.56s)]
*  It's not just a temporary problem caused [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=274.74s)]
*  by COVID disrupted supply chains. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=276.54s)]
*  It is absolutely real. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  The American economy starting to sizzle once again [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=281.18s)]
*  as it emerges from the pandemic. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=284.38s)]
*  And workers' paychecks are too [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  with businesses practically begging for help. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=288.3s)]
*  But there's a flip side to all the raises [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  and that's inflation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=293.22s)]
*  Prices rising at the fastest rate since 2008. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=294.74s)]
*  Everything from washing machines up almost 30% [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=298.54s)]
*  to furniture up 11% and television sets up 8%. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=302.66s)]
*  So it's happening throughout the economy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=309.70000000000005s)]

*  Try to buy a house. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=317.06s)]
*  It's now more expensive to buy a home [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=318.38s)]
*  than it has ever been at any time in American history. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=320.26s)]
*  The median existing home price last year was 310,000. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=323.44s)]
*  It's now over 356,000 and a lot more [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=327.06s)]
*  in the zip codes you might wanna live in. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=330.32s)]
*  Part of the reason is the cost of building materials. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=332.26s)]
*  They're completely out of control. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  Last October, lumber went for about $580 per thousand [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=336.14s)]
*  board feet. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=340.02s)]
*  As of last week, it was 712. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=340.9s)]
*  Last August, used cars, which you might need, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=344.14s)]
*  were selling for an average price of 21,000. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=346.46s)]
*  This August, a year later, they were almost 28,000. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=348.9s)]
*  Same car, seven grand more. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=352.78s)]
*  Over the same period, by the way, as you well know, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=355.85999999999996s)]
*  the price of gas jumped a full dollar a gallon [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=357.96s)]
*  and a lot more than that in some places. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=360.58s)]
*  But in the grocery lately, the cost of a pound of steak [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=363.26s)]
*  is up by two bucks. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=365.58s)]
*  A pound of bacon costs over $7 right now. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=367.5s)]
*  And suddenly everything costs more. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=370.76s)]
*  Eggs, milk, coffee, mustard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=372.06s)]
*  These are not luxury items. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=375.1s)]
*  This is not a trip to St. Barts. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=376.98s)]
*  These are things you buy every week and you have to buy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  The question is, are your wages rising as fast [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=381.38s)]
*  as your costs? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=387.06s)]
*  Vegetable oil is up 60%. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=388.1s)]
*  So probably not. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=390.22s)]
*  And that means you're getting poorer, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=391.66s)]
*  whether you realize it or not. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=394.5s)]
*  But that's what inflation does. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  It causes poverty. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=397.6s)]
*  So because we can prove that the population [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=400.12s)]
*  of the United States is getting poorer by the day, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=403.86s)]
*  you'd think the Biden administration [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=407.14s)]
*  would be actively concerned about this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=408.5s)]
*  and working to make it better. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=409.94s)]
*  But they're doing the opposite. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=411.36s)]
*  They're actively making it much worse. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=412.3s)]
*  And here's how they're doing it, by spending. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=415.16s)]
*  No government in the history of the world [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=417.6s)]
*  has ever spent more money than Joe Biden [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=419.66s)]
*  is spending right now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=422.42s)]
*  In fiscal year 2019, just the other day, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=423.68s)]
*  the entire federal government spent $6.6 trillion. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=426.6s)]
*  Then COVID hit the following year and those numbers went up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=429.54s)]
*  They went up by 40%. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  And federal spending in 2020 jumped to 9.1 trillion. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=434.1s)]
*  Was that too much? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=437.82s)]
*  Of course it was. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=438.66s)]
*  What did we get for it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=439.5s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  But here's the shocking thing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=441.94s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, as COVID recedes, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=443.62s)]
*  it's going up even higher [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=445.62s)]
*  because they're no longer using COVID as a pretext. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  Through the end of this August, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=450.5s)]
*  which is to say a month and a half ago, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=452.26s)]
*  the federal government has already spent more in 2021 [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=454.18s)]
*  than it did over the entire calendar years [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=457.58000000000004s)]
*  of 2019 and 2018. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=460.02000000000004s)]
*  So all of this drives inflation to scary levels, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=463.70000000000005s)]
*  but they're not scary to everyone. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  If you're a massively leveraged financial institution [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  that owes a lot of money to a lot of people [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=471.86s)]
*  and that's how you're making your money, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=473.70000000000005s)]
*  this is not necessarily bad news. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  If money is worth less, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=478.04s)]
*  that means that your debt service costs less. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=479.3s)]
*  You don't fear inflation. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=482.3s)]
*  Inflation helps you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=484.62s)]
*  The problem is it crushes the American middle class. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=486.14000000000004s)]
*  Now in a normal country, this would be a huge concern, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=490.20000000000005s)]
*  but because the people who make our policy [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=493.34s)]
*  don't care about the middle class, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=495.26s)]
*  this is a bargain well worth making. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=497.26s)]
*  Bloomberg News just published a piece with this headline, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=499.61999999999995s)]
*  which we're not making up. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=501.9s)]
*  They're celebrating the disaster. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=502.76s)]
*  American needs higher, longer lasting inflation. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  If you can even imagine writing something like this, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=508.64s)]
*  does America need more emphysema too? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=510.85999999999996s)]
*  It's grotesque. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  Now most people may not know this is happening. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=514.74s)]
*  Normal people don't read Bloomberg News. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=516.18s)]
*  They may be unaware that these attitudes even exist [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=518.06s)]
*  in what they assumed was their country. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=520.5799999999999s)]
*  And the Biden administration would like to keep it that way. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=522.62s)]
*  It would like to keep the population [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=524.3s)]
*  from finding out what's happening. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=525.46s)]
*  So here's the treasury secretary, Janet Allen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=527.34s)]
*  She's the reptile who once ran the Federal Reserve [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=529.22s)]
*  and is therefore more responsible [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=531.66s)]
*  than any single living person for your growing poverty. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=533.1s)]
*  Here she is assuring you that $7 bacon [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=536.14s)]
*  isn't actually a problem. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=538.46s)]
*  That's not really inflation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=540.14s)]
*  It's something called transitory inflation. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=541.7s)]
*  I don't believe that we're at risk of hyperinflation. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=545.74s)]
*  We've had several months of high inflation [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=549.5s)]
*  that most economists, including me, believe will be transitory [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=553.34s)]
*  as our economy gets back in full swing after the pandemic. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=560.46s)]
*  It's just transitory. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=568.58s)]
*  It's the price of progress, $7 bacon. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=569.74s)]
*  Yeah, but look what you're getting in return. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=571.9s)]
*  Aren't things great? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=573.74s)]
*  Until just a few hours ago, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=575.38s)]
*  that was the official line in Washington [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=576.42s)]
*  along with those Southwest delays were caused by weather [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=578.22s)]
*  and our withdrawal from Afghanistan [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  was actually a huge success. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=582.86s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=584.26s)]
*  That's what they were telling us. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=586.3000000000001s)]
*  And then the president of the Atlanta Fed, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=588.02s)]
*  a man called Rafael Bostic, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=589.94s)]
*  admitted what was very obvious [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=591.38s)]
*  to anyone who goes to the grocery store. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=592.76s)]
*  This actually is inflation. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=594.94s)]
*  It is real inflation. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=596.5s)]
*  It is not transitory inflation [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  and it's going to be here for a long time. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=599.22s)]
*  What he didn't say was that this is not an act of God. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=601.64s)]
*  This isn't a hurricane. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=604.22s)]
*  It's not an earthquake. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  It's not something we can't control. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=606.22s)]
*  This is the result of decades of policy [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=607.98s)]
*  that have enriched a few and impoverished the many. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=610.7s)]
*  When will the reckoning be for that? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=615.22s)]
*  And what are the effects for you going forward? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMAbEmRD9JI&t=616.84s)]
