# San Francisco Police Department member tells Tucker they are fed up
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c)
*  Tracy McCrary is a senior sergeant at the Bayview Police Station in San Francisco. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=5.2s)]
*  Sergeant, I'm amazed that you're willing to come on the show and grateful that you are. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=6.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=11.84s)]
*  Tell us what it's like in San Francisco right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=12.98s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=15.52s)]
*  San Francisco, as you can see from all the videos, the boarded up shops, the empty spaces [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=18.64s)]
*  is a city that is spiraling or already in the bottom of the toilet. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=25.72s)]
*  So what's going to happen? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=31.72s)]
*  I mean, can it get worse? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=34.56s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=36.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=38.6s)]
*  Again, thank you for your firsthand account of this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=39.92s)]
*  We watch the videos, but you know, if you don't live there, it's hard to know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=44.76s)]
*  You're a police officer there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=47.72s)]
*  How frustrating is this for you to watch? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=49.22s)]
*  Well, for me, it's very frustrating because I'm a native here, born and raised. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=53.2s)]
*  The time I did spend in the Bayview before I was promoted to the lieutenant who's now [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  in charge of the robbery unit, which is my day job, I see all of this in real time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  And it's concerning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  I see this when I'm working. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  I see this when I'm off duty. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=70.48s)]
*  I see this as the vice president of the union representing the men and women trying to serve [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=72.16s)]
*  this city to the best of their ability. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=77.2s)]
*  I don't know about our other partners, what they're doing, but we have a problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=79.8s)]
*  Let's recognize that we have a problem and let's get to a solution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=85.08s)]
*  Are you confident the police could fix this if they were allowed to fix it? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=89.6s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=93.8s)]
*  I am very confident because we have the will of 2,200 members who come in day in and day [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=95.8s)]
*  out to do their job and to make this city better. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=101.4s)]
*  Amen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=105.8s)]
*  And that's the whole point of government, is to make the lives of the people who live [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=107.4s)]
*  in your city better. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=111.56s)]
*  I've got to ask, what percentage of the population, people who live in San Francisco, are frustrated [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=112.56s)]
*  by this? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=118.54s)]
*  Well, I'll say a lot now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=119.54s)]
*  You mentioned the DA, the recall that is happening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=123.48s)]
*  You had 83,000 signatures. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=127.5s)]
*  They want to blame the Republicans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=129.62s)]
*  We don't have 83,000 Republicans in San Francisco. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=131.1s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=133.84s)]
*  So to cross— [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=134.84s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=135.84s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=137.28s)]
*  So it's a cross-section of people who are now fed up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=138.28s)]
*  The West Portal area just had a sideshow, which has set people off. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=140.96s)]
*  So like, we know what we need to do. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=148.2s)]
*  Let's just have the guts to do it and stop talking about it, you know? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=151.4s)]
*  So it's incredibly frustrating, but even as frustrated as we are, we're still willing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=156.6s)]
*  to show up and to do our job. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=162.24s)]
*  And I wish our other partners in the justice system would just do theirs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=164.42s)]
*  Well, you've certainly done yours tonight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  Trisha McCrary of the San Francisco Police Department. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=171.06s)]
*  Grateful that you came on tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=173.06s)]
*  And I hope that makes a difference. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=174.06s)]
*  I bet it will. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  I hope so, too. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLB9PCefb0c&t=178.45999999999998s)]
