# Ron DeSantis takes new comprehensive steps against anti-fiduciary ESG governance
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo)
*  So something called ESG is one of the operating principles of global investing right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=0.0s)]
*  But try to get someone to define with precision what ESG is and no one will because there [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=6.96s)]
*  is no precise definition. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=11.28s)]
*  Because the point of it is to push corporate investors to the left and then of course to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=12.8s)]
*  punish anyone who descends. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=18.12s)]
*  In pursuit of high ESG scores, poor countries like Sri Lanka have destroyed their economies [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  and then saw their government toppled as a result. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=24.76s)]
*  Countries like Germany are dimming their traffic lights to save electricity because of ESG. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=27.56s)]
*  So if ESG accelerates in this country, you can imagine where we will be. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=33.76s)]
*  Very few politicians seem aware this is even happening. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=41.32s)]
*  One who does know what's going on is doing something to stop it is the governor of Florida, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=43.8s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=47.32s)]
*  He has an announcement tonight about his plan to fight ESG in the state of Florida. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=48.32s)]
*  Governor DeSantis joins us now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=52.36s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on and thanks for noticing this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=53.36s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=56.72s)]
*  So what are you going to do to push back? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=57.72s)]
*  Well Tucker, we're going to do a couple things. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=59.76s)]
*  First we are going to do through Florida's state pension system a flat ban on any type [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=64.04s)]
*  of ESG. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=69.24s)]
*  And as you say, they like to wiggle around. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=70.24s)]
*  It's basically a way for them to do politics. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=72.68s)]
*  So we're going to make sure that that fiduciary duty is defined very clearly and that they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=75.44s)]
*  stick to that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=80.32s)]
*  We also want to provide protections for people in the financial marketplace from being discriminated [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=81.32s)]
*  against based on ideology. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  I mean we've seen Wall Street banks discriminate against contractors who are involved in helping [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  us against illegal immigration or against firearm manufacturers, things they don't like. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  So the upshot of all this Tucker is we want to stop these kind of masters of the universe [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=98.8s)]
*  from trying to do through economic power what they cannot achieve at the ballot box. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=105.08s)]
*  And it's really an end run around democracy where they're trying to impose these things. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  And here in Florida, I want to be governed by the values of Destin, not the values of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=115.52s)]
*  Davos. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  It's anti-democratic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=123.16s)]
*  I mean, so nobody ever votes on, I mean there's never been a vote on anything pertaining to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=124.16s)]
*  ESG. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=129.68s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=130.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=134.16s)]
*  And what happens is, is you'll have asset managers who manage all these pension funds. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=135.16s)]
*  They will require ESG. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=139.68s)]
*  The companies themselves will do it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=141.32s)]
*  I think there's a couple of reasons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=143.28s)]
*  I do think part of this is there's woke employees in these companies and the inmates have basically [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=144.72s)]
*  run the asylum. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=149.72s)]
*  So some of the CEOs bend to that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=150.84s)]
*  But I do think there's some of these CEOs, Tucker, who really like to exert power over [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=153.0s)]
*  the rest of us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=157.96s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=159.16s)]
*  It'll be a disaster for our economy, of course, with what we've seen with the energy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=160.16s)]
*  But to have the economy politicized this way, that's a recipe for disaster. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=165.1s)]
*  It takes power away from the American people and lodges it into these international corporate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=170.82s)]
*  titans. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=176.98s)]
*  And that's not, I think, what our founding fathers ever intended. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=178.34s)]
*  It certainly isn't. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=181.98s)]
*  And it's been going on for years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=182.98s)]
*  And I don't think I've ever heard a national level politician mention it, even mention [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=189.82s)]
*  Are other governors aware this is happening in their states with their state's pension [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=190.82s)]
*  funds? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=194.14s)]
*  I think there are. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=196.34s)]
*  And I think that you're going to see some other states do with Florida. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=197.46s)]
*  And then what I'd like to do is get a lot of the conservative states together and let's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=200.34s)]
*  get our proxy voting rights on all of our funds. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=205.82s)]
*  Let's combine those and vote as a bloc. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=209.62s)]
*  Tucker, we'd have over a trillion dollars in assets between just the red states. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=211.7s)]
*  That would make a difference when you're talking about that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  So we would be able to check a lot of these ESG votes that are going on throughout corporate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  America. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=224.26s)]
*  I would urge all my fellow governors around the country, hell, Republican or Democrat, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=225.26s)]
*  let's band together and let's fight back against this so we can keep power to the people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=229.7s)]
*  Yeah, because the consequences we've seen around the world have been really, really [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=233.62s)]
*  severe. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  Governor, on to San Jose, Florida. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate your telling us about that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaOgcDIrqo&t=240.82s)]
