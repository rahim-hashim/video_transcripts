# Brian Kilmeade: San Francisco's looting 'free for all' is out of control
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE)
*  Alright, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening everybody. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=2.92s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade and this is Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=3.92s)]
*  According to the schedule, I'm filling in all show, standby. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=6.12s)]
*  By now many of you know and have seen Tucker's interview with Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=10.14s)]
*  It's tremendous. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=13.24s)]
*  So we still have more of that exclusive interview. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=14.4s)]
*  A segment you have never seen before, never before seen, Chunk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=16.44s)]
*  It's coming your way in a matter of moments, standby. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=19.66s)]
*  It's a free for all in San Francisco. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  We've been reporting about this since Fox & Friends this morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=25.04s)]
*  Just this past weekend, mobs of thieves ransacked retail stores, pharmacies, luxury shops, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=28.74s)]
*  law enforcement is calling many of these raids organized. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  You think so? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=37.18s)]
*  In a single 24 hour period, you got a mob of looters targeting a Louis Vuitton high [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=38.18s)]
*  end shopping district store, while as many as 80 looters in ski masks raided in Nordstrom [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=42.339999999999996s)]
*  just outside the city. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=47.18s)]
*  Eyewitnesses describe the scene as something out of a movie. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=48.58s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=51.58s)]
*  In a nearby Oakland, nearby Oakland by the way, about 17 miles away, the same period [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=52.7s)]
*  of time hundreds of vehicles reportedly targeted marijuana dispensaries and other stores. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  Car break-ins are on the rise in San Francisco as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  Compared to last year, break-ins are up, get this, 753%. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=65.14s)]
*  As the Hoover Institute recently noted, which by the way is right in that neighborhood, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=70.54s)]
*  San Francisco is now more dangerous than 98% of the US cities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=74.06s)]
*  I'm looking for example Compton, California, a city famous for drug wars and gang wars. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=77.54s)]
*  It's now almost twice as safe as San Francisco. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=82.32s)]
*  Almost all of this increase in crime can be traced back to Proposition 47. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  That's a referendum that was passed back in 2014 in California. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=90.8s)]
*  It was backed by California elites like Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Napster founder Sean [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=94.6s)]
*  Parker as well as George Soros' Open Society Foundation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  It was called the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, but Proposition 47 did just the opposite. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Proposition 47 reclassified certain theft and drug possessions as only a misdemeanor [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=109.6s)]
*  if the dollar allotted to $950. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=113.8s)]
*  Yep, that's where this all started. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=115.88s)]
*  Now previously any theft or drug possession over $400 was a felony. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  In other words, crimes that were once felonies and punishable by up to three years in prison [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  are now simple misdemeanors. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=126.84s)]
*  Law enforcement may not even bother investigating or prosecuting, often won't even bring charges. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=128.6s)]
*  Those who charge are basically facing a maximum of six months in jail if that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=133.76s)]
*  So San Francisco Police Lieutenant Tracy McCray explained it this way, quote, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  If you steal below $950, you get a citation and you can just get to walk away. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=141.84s)]
*  And if you don't show up in court, guess what? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=146.44s)]
*  Maybe you get a bench warrant or maybe they even toss that out before it gets to the point. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=148.68s)]
*  In some ways it doesn't even seem to make any sense to call shoplifting shoplifting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=153.6s)]
*  This isn't one person going to a store and concealing goods in their pockets or bags. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=158.04s)]
*  These are organized mobs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Look at this video I'm sharing the screen with. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  They're not trying to hide anything. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=165.32s)]
*  Nearly 100 people joined the mob of organized theft just this past weekend in San Francisco [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=167.12s)]
*  at a high-end shopping district. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=172.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  The sounds and sights of Union Square are not as pretty today as they usually are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's what's left behind. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=180.0s)]
*  Windows are boarded up at Louis Vuitton. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=181.44s)]
*  Crews replacing an entire door at this Yves Saint Laurent. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  Windows are shattered at Burberry with a hole still left over on its door. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Wooden boards also covered the windows at Hermes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=192.28s)]
*  A witness captured the moment people tried to break in. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  When I passed by Hermes, there were a group of people, I would say it's really around [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=198.16s)]
*  100 people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=202.08s)]
*  And then after I passed them, they just started to try to get into Hermes and they started [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=203.56s)]
*  cracking the glass. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  It's insanity. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Theft is so bad in San Francisco that over the last few years Walgreens has closed 22 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=212.84s)]
*  stores in the city. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=216.96s)]
*  The retail pharmacy spends 35 times more on security guards in San Francisco than they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=217.96s)]
*  do anywhere else. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=222.56s)]
*  Walgreens saying it's closing more than 20 stores, five in San Francisco, because of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=224.6s)]
*  this rampant problem, what's being called organized retail crime. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=228.6s)]
*  The company pulling the plug on these locations saying it made the decision only after having [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=232.28s)]
*  increased our investments in security measures in stores across the city to 46 times our [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=236.32s)]
*  chain average in an effort to provide a safe environment. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=241.22s)]
*  And drugstore items ending up in impromptu markets like this in San Francisco. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=244.34s)]
*  It's surreal, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=248.84s)]
*  Store security wouldn't intervene to stop the shoplifters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=250.28s)]
*  I personally don't think they can. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  And of course would they? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  And if they did decide to jump in, why would you get killed over this? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=255.48s)]
*  A mob of thieves in Oakland over the weekend fired 175 shots as they stole from a dozen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=258.28s)]
*  different businesses. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=263.82s)]
*  The gunfire forced the police to retreat to safe areas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  The cops are pushed back. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  You can see footage of those shoplifters writing a Wellspring pharmacy on your screen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=269.7s)]
*  You would think elected officials in San Francisco would be interested in solving this problem. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  But if you ask them, there is no problem. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=278.32s)]
*  Just last month, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, real name, said Walgreens was exaggerating [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=281.28s)]
*  about having to close because of all the theft. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=285.94s)]
*  Like, you know, they've made their decision. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=290.4s)]
*  We have tried to work with them in order to ensure that we are covered in terms of having [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=293.32s)]
*  pharmacies all across the city. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=299.0s)]
*  This is going to, of course, impact a lot of our neighborhoods. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=300.55999999999995s)]
*  But I wouldn't say go as far as to say they can't do business. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  They still have a lot of stores everywhere you look. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=306.76s)]
*  Almost every corner you'll see a Walgreens. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=310.12s)]
*  And some of these stores are not just closing because of retail theft, they're closing because [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=311.72s)]
*  they're not necessarily bringing in the sales that they once did. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=316.44s)]
*  So I don't want to attribute that completely to just retail theft. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=319.68s)]
*  Oh, I would. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, San Francisco's Radical District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who used to be a translator [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  for Hugo Chavez, now dead, wants San Francisco to show compassion for shoplifters. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=329.46s)]
*  He recently explained that jailing shoplifters would expose them to poor living conditions [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=334.52s)]
*  in jail. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=338.72s)]
*  There are people who are going to take those packages sometimes. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=340.72s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=344.0s)]
*  And it's a crime. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=345.0s)]
*  And we're going to prosecute it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  But we want to do it in a way that's compassionate, that's humane, and that understands the root [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  causes of that crime and that gets at them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=354.04s)]
*  Because if we put someone in jail for stealing a package off my front steps for the maximum, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=356.48s)]
*  which is usually going to be six months, and put them right back on the street, we've cost [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=361.16s)]
*  the city a lot of money. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=366.8s)]
*  We've exposed someone to the sexual assault that occurs in jails, to the contagious diseases [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=368.96s)]
*  that are transmitted in jails. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  What idiocy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=375.56s)]
*  Now that it's more than just pharmacies that are being looted, Chesa Boudin is, quote, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqZDRgI86CE&t=376.91999999999996s)]
