# Glenn Youngkin vows to fight 'ludicrous' law tying Virginia to California’s gas-vehicle ban
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s)
*  Glenn Yonkin, to his credit, is talking about it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the governor of Virginia. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=2.2s)]
*  He says he's going to reverse his state's planned ban [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=3.64s)]
*  on gasoline-powered cars enacted under [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=6.24s)]
*  the previous administration. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=8.8s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for joining us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=9.88s)]
*  This is one of those topics, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=12.36s)]
*  I think you're one of the only governors in the country [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=13.8s)]
*  who's talking about this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=16.44s)]
*  Why do you think this is worth addressing? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=17.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, Tucker, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  And when Virginians elected me governor last year, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=23.2s)]
*  they wanted to put a stop to an effort [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=26.52s)]
*  from the previous Democratic-led administration [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=29.04s)]
*  to turn Virginia into California. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=31.88s)]
*  Well, little did they know that they had signed legislation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=33.72s)]
*  and tied Virginia to decisions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=37.8s)]
*  that are gonna be made in California. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=40.6s)]
*  So not only did they pick a state that has demonstrated [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=42.0s)]
*  it has no idea how to run itself, to tie itself to, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=46.28s)]
*  but they abdicated their responsibility [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=48.66s)]
*  to serve Virginians. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=51.28s)]
*  And so we find ourselves today with this ludicrous law [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=52.8s)]
*  that Virginia has to follow California's laws. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=56.4s)]
*  And so we're gonna go to work and stop this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=59.76s)]
*  because Virginians should be making decision for Virginians. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=61.68s)]
*  And that's why I was elected governor last year, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=64.72s)]
*  to stop a government that was very comfortable [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=67.2s)]
*  telling people what to do all the time [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=70.28s)]
*  and forgetting that we're here in fact, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=72.64s)]
*  to make our own decisions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=74.82s)]
*  Freedom in fact matters in Virginia. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=76.28s)]
*  That's why parents make decisions [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=78.4s)]
*  about whether kids wear masks today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=80.02s)]
*  That's why people can make a decision [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=82.12s)]
*  about whether they wanna get a vaccine or not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=83.64s)]
*  And I'm gonna go to work to make sure they can decide [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  what kind of car they wanna buy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=88.2s)]
*  Well, I think that's right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=90.0s)]
*  And thank you for doing that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=91.2s)]
*  And that's the premise of democracy is itself government, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=93.16s)]
*  which is curiously lacking at this point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  I wonder how many Virginians were even aware [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=97.48s)]
*  that their cars were about to be banned? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=100.84s)]
*  Well, I don't think any. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=104.76s)]
*  I think they did it very quietly. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, the law itself is ludicrous. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=109.16s)]
*  Virginia last year, 2% of all cars sold [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=112.48s)]
*  were electric vehicles. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  And to say that in 2026, we're gonna have 35%. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=117.64s)]
*  We're gonna phase them out totally by 2035 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  is just ridiculous. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=123.12s)]
*  But on top of that, and more so, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  this is about elected officials completely abdicating [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=127.4s)]
*  their responsibility to make the laws [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=130.68s)]
*  and the regulations for Virginians [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=133.68s)]
*  based on Virginians' elections. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  And so that's why they voted for us in November. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=137.8s)]
*  That's why we swept the house races. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=140.2s)]
*  That's why I have a Republican attorney general [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=142.52s)]
*  and a Republican lieutenant governor. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=144.04s)]
*  And we're gonna go to work and make sure [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=146.12s)]
*  we get this turned around [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=147.4s)]
*  come our legislative session in January. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=148.4s)]
*  So I don't know if you can see a return monitor [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=150.88s)]
*  where you are, but I wanna put a video on the screen [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=153.04s)]
*  of charging stations in California [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=154.64s)]
*  that appear to have been completely taken over [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=157.16s)]
*  by tent cities of vagrants living in front of them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=159.04s)]
*  There's this weird syndrome. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=162.56s)]
*  I'm sure you see it among your fellow governors [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=163.8s)]
*  where the basics fall apart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=165.32s)]
*  You can't have air conditioning in August [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=167.04s)]
*  and there's some guy smoking meth on your front steps, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=169.4s)]
*  but we're gonna save the climate? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  What is that weird impulse? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=174.96s)]
*  Well, I think it is a complete disassociation [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=178.52s)]
*  with what real people are worried about. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  What Virginians and Americans are worried about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  is inflation and schools and a solid education. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=187.52s)]
*  And oh, by the way, parents being listened to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=190.52s)]
*  and safety in their communities. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  And yet here we had the Virginia legislature [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=195.24s)]
*  under Democrat rule last year, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  forget that they work for Virginians [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=200.16s)]
*  and tie it to California. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=202.12s)]
*  Next thing you know, they would wanna tie us [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  to their homeless laws or their tax laws, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=205.2s)]
*  which is why everybody is leaving California. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=207.68s)]
*  So this is a chance to reestablish Virginians [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=210.28s)]
*  making decisions for Virginians [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=212.88s)]
*  based on the leaders they elect. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=214.6s)]
*  That seems like an inherently moderate [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  and sensible idea to me. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=219.44s)]
*  And I'm glad you're doing it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=221.04s)]
*  Governor Youngkin of Virginia, thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GJWkKag6s&t=222.0s)]
