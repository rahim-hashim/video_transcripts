# 'It's like walking on eggshells' to not enrage the wokesters: Sharon Osbourne
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s)
*  So you may recall that when the fake duchess from Los Angeles and her braided dead husband told Oprah that the royal family is racist, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=0.0s)]
*  Piers Morgan called BS in them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Huh? Of course they're not racist. What are you even talking about? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=8.6s)]
*  But for doing that, the media accused Piers Morgan of racism, and he was fired from his job. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=11.4s)]
*  And then when his old friend Sharon Osborne decided to defend Piers Morgan, the media accused Sharon Osborne of racism too. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=16.8s)]
*  In fact, Sharon Osborne's co-host at CBS suggested she was a bigot [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=23.2s)]
*  for asking how exactly is Piers Morgan a racist for pointing out that the fake duchess was lying. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=27.2s)]
*  So for the first time, Sharon Osborne is explaining what exactly happened. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=32.7s)]
*  And she does it on her new show, Sharon Osborne to Hell and Back, which is now on Fox Nation's Out on Monday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=36.1s)]
*  And in the show, she explains how she fought the urge to wag a middle finger in the faces of her CBS co-hosts. Watch. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=41.4s)]
*  I was the lamb that was slaughtered that morning and CBS denied responsibility on the news. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=49.1s)]
*  And that's because they're wankers and... [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=58.0s)]
*  We reached out to CBS for comment on what Sharon had to say, and they reiterated their statement from March saying that they found no evidence that she had been set up. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  So how does this make sense? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=69.1s)]
*  You can get ganged up on on live television. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=70.5s)]
*  And when you go to defend yourself against accusations, you get fired for creating a hostile work environment. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=73.5s)]
*  This is the world we live in today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=80.8s)]
*  I wanted to look into the camera and say, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=82.3s)]
*  and CBS take that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=86.8s)]
*  Sharon Osborne joins us tonight. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=90.5s)]
*  Sharon, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=92.3s)]
*  When historians go back and do a postmortem on our society and try to figure out how did everyone go crazy in a four year period, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=93.6s)]
*  I think they're going to take a look at what happened. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=100.1s)]
*  I honestly do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=102.4s)]
*  What happened to you is one of the nuttiest things I've ever seen. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=103.5s)]
*  You were six degrees of separation away from the story. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=106.7s)]
*  You just spoke up for an old friend and you had to leave your job. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about this? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=113.4s)]
*  I think a lot. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=114.5s)]
*  Since. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=115.2s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  It is the world that we're living in and especially in film and TV where people want to be overly, overly woke. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=119.7s)]
*  So the slightest thing, it's like walking on eggshells and there are no second chances. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  You could you could have, you know, in today's world, you could have put something on your social media 10, 12 years ago and people will look back [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  and they will fire you because you wrote it 10, 12 years ago. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=147.2s)]
*  You know, they're a different scenario. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  Somebody could have been drunk with a bunch of people, you know, out of control. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=153.5s)]
*  Perhaps you may have changed your mind by now, but no, even from years ago, people want to condemn you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=158.4s)]
*  So I always wondered watching this story. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=168.3s)]
*  I've never asked you about it, but a lot of the people you worked with who I think you got along with perfectly well really behaved in a despicable way toward you in a cowardly, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=170.3s)]
*  cruel way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=180.0s)]
*  And I wonder what was your conversation off camera with them like? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Did they ever apologize to you for treating you like that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  No, I had to apologize to them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=188.5s)]
*  I mean, I must be truthful that in the first break I was saying to one of my co-hosts, why talk to me, talk to me, tell me why you're doing this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=191.3s)]
*  Tell me where this came from. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=203.5s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=205.3s)]
*  And she turned her back on me like this and pretended to be talking to the person in the booth and wouldn't talk to me. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=207.0s)]
*  And so I swore at her and I did do that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=216.9s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  I swear a lot to my friends. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  And if someone's a real friend, she'd been with worked with me for nearly 11 years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=224.4s)]
*  We traveled together, done everything together, been to my house lots of times, you know, supposed to have loved my family too. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=230.3s)]
*  And then she turns around and stabs me in the back. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know, I do swear a lot and that's who I am. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=244.0s)]
*  And CBS knew that before they gave me the job. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=250.0s)]
*  And I was there nearly 11 years. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=253.7s)]
*  So 11 years of me swearing didn't bother them off air. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=255.9s)]
*  It's one of the cruelest, most awful things I've seen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=261.9s)]
*  And it's a small thing, but it just tells you a lot about the mindset. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=267.1s)]
*  Anyway, I appreciate the fact that you survived and that you're back on TV. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=270.3s)]
*  And that you joined us tonight. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=273.9s)]
*  Well, thank you very, very much. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=277.0s)]
*  And the thing is, it's not just a small thing because nobody will touch me now because of what happened. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  So it's not a small thing, but I'm fine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  I can take care of myself. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=291.4s)]
*  But what about the people that can't? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=293.2s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=297.0s)]
*  That's what we've got to worry about. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=297.5s)]
*  Thousands of people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=298.9s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=299.9s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=300.9s)]
*  Thousands of people that lose their jobs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=301.8s)]
*  That's who I worry about, not me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=304.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=306.8s)]
*  People with no power. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=308.3s)]
*  Sharon Osborne, thank you very much. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=309.6s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  So we've been trying to... [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZA7fNWWo1s&t=313.3s)]
