# Tucker Carlson:  It's time to reassess our view of Kamala Harris
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight the true measure of character a wise man once said is not whether you make a mistake [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=0.0s)]
*  All of us do but whether you learn from that mistake [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=6.72s)]
*  With those words in mind, we'd like to begin tonight with an admission. It's contrition night on Fox News [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=10.28s)]
*  It is time to reassess our view of Kamala Harris [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=16.56s)]
*  Now if you watch the show, you know that for more than a year now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=20.88s)]
*  You've had a pretty conventional understanding of this country's first black slash Indian slash part Canadian vice president [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Who also happens to identify as a woman? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Now we've assumed that Kamala Harris was historically unpopular because she's historically incompetent and fake [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=32.12s)]
*  We assume she earned her low approval numbers and we're not alone in that lots of other people have come to the very same conclusion [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=38.96s)]
*  There's currently a debate among software engineers about whether Harris is even of biological origin or instead the product of a classified government AI [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=45.0s)]
*  Project gone wrong. We don't know the answer, but we certainly understand the question. She's that synthetic [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=52.84s)]
*  So again until the other day we assume that people don't like Kamala Harris because she's highly unlikable [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=59.32s)]
*  Keep in mind that even her own husband kisses her with a mask on to us. That seemed like a pretty clear sign [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  But we're here tonight to tell you that assumptions can change even assumptions rooted in overwhelming evidence and observable reality [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=72.2s)]
*  Sometimes and this happens your entire world view can flip upside down instantly invert in a flash of light [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=80.92s)]
*  as Sol of Tarsus [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=89.24s)]
*  Our road to damascus experience came when we saw this clip of joy reed from msnbc doing a drive-time radio show [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Watching it. We realized the problem isn't kamala harris [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=99.32s)]
*  The problem is us [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=103.24s)]
*  So take a look at this open your mind a little bit and see if you don't come to the same life-changing conclusion that we did [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=105.16s)]
*  Here's joy reed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=111.56s)]
*  I think for kamala harris, she's had like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=113.32s)]
*  The triple problem of being a woman and so people not being willing to respect her the way they would respect a male vice president [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=116.12s)]
*  Of being black which we already know that what that carries with it is the anti-blackness comes, you know with the package [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=122.36s)]
*  And then also being vice president at a time that is really really difficult [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=128.36s)]
*  So when I talk about this all the time madam vice president and you know this charlie. She's black black [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=132.44s)]
*  Okay, she went to howard she aka and when she talks to you. Yeah, it is I mean she sounds so regular [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=136.84s)]
*  She's so regular and approachable and I just it's unfortunate that more people don't see that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=142.04s)]
*  And there's also just the dumbing down of the american electorate, you know, people don't understand civics. They don't understand politics [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  They don't understand how things work [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=153.32s)]
*  Did you hear that have you internalized it? Have you brought it deep inside? Let it marinate a little bit [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=155.88s)]
*  People who don't like kamala harris are sexist obviously because like admiral rachel levin [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=162.2s)]
*  She identifies as a woman too. They're also racist because kamala harris is the daughter of a jamaican college professor, duh [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=167.24s)]
*  And by the way, they're also stupid by definition. They know nothing about civics or american politics [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=173.96s)]
*  It's the dumbing down of america unlike kamala harris. You don't quote understand how things work [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  So the takeaway is kamala harris isn't unpopular because she's a bad person. She's unpopular because you're a bad person [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=185.56s)]
*  You're the problem your racism is hurting kamala harris's political career damn you bigot [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=191.88s)]
*  And then we realized how's this for mind-bending joy reid was talking about us [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  And then we broke down and shed the bitter tears of self-awareness [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=204.28s)]
*  And our journey of education began we wanted to know more [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=209.48s)]
*  So we found an interview that joy reid recently did with a black supremacist website called the root a website [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=212.28s)]
*  That's now a permanent fixture in our favorites tab [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=216.84s)]
*  Rita's the child of well-educated african immigrants grew up in a white neighborhood in denver and went to harvard [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=219.96s)]
*  So naturally she's got a gut level understanding of the historic black experience in america the way you do when you're from denver and went to harvard [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=225.16s)]
*  You just feel it. It's just part of you the way it's part of kamala harris after growing up in montreal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=231.88s)]
*  As joy reid put it quote kamala is just a regular sister in the same way people would always say that michelle obama is like [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=237.64s)]
*  Your sister if your cousin became first lady [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=243.32s)]
*  Kamala harris is like if your cousin became vice president of the united states [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=246.28s)]
*  I think she doesn't get to show that personality often enough and so people haven't had a chance to know her [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  You following this so kamala harris is like your sister in the same way that michelle obama would be like your sister [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=255.64s)]
*  If your sister was your cousin and also married to the president [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=261.4s)]
*  Why hadn't we realized that before? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  Well as joy reid pointed out quote most of the media is still white and male of course [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=267.4s)]
*  Those damn white males always hiding the sister cousin connection [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=271.8s)]
*  That's what they do [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=275.48s)]
*  But for us the veil had been lifted [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  We could see for the first time what our racism had blinded us to for so long and the truth hurt [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=279.0s)]
*  It was so painful that for days we had to wear sunglasses even indoors [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=284.12s)]
*  But it was worth it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  Because at that point began a journey of contrition and self-discovery that honestly was long overdue [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=289.56s)]
*  Like adam kensinger we finally faced the truth about ourselves [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  And were moved to weeping by what we saw how could we be so darn racist? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=299.56s)]
*  That's the question we're asking ourselves tonight in the fading light of this year's juneteenth observance [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  So that was the old us we've shed it like a snakeskin. It's time to change. It's time to do better [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=310.36s)]
*  It's time to think anew tonight [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  About what we thought we knew [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  about kamala harris [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=320.44s)]
*  So we're going to take a look at some of the sound bites [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=322.6s)]
*  We have mocked on this show over the last year and a half and boy doesn't it feel good just to admit fault [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Just to say to the world. Yes [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  We're not perfect we get it wrong sometimes [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  But not anymore [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=337.32s)]
*  We have fresh eyes and with those eyes. We're going to assess this footage in a brand new way [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=339.08s)]
*  So here's tape of harris repeating the very same line about quote speaking truth. We used to make fun of this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=344.76s)]
*  not anymore [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=350.44s)]
*  One of the most important values that I think we must fight for is is to speak truth [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=352.28s)]
*  And we will speak truth about the injustice we will speak truth about the inequity we will speak truth about the unfairness [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=357.0s)]
*  And let's speak truth [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=364.44s)]
*  Let's speak truth [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=366.2s)]
*  So let's speak some truth and we must speak truth. No matter how uncomfortable it may be to hear [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=367.88s)]
*  We need to speak truth. We have to speak truth one must speak truth [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=374.44s)]
*  And that we speak truth and we must have the courage [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=379.64s)]
*  To speak truth someone who has the courage to speak truth [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=384.28s)]
*  Um, I applaud her courage to speak truth and let's speak the biggest truth [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=388.68s)]
*  the biggest truth of all [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  So our assumption really for decades was that politicians who make a habit of using the word truth are probably really by definition [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=396.28s)]
*  Lying, that's why they say truth so often i'm not cheating. I promise [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=403.8s)]
*  But what really struck us the old us [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  Was the fact that kamala or camelot, you know, it doesn't matter how you pronounce her name. It just doesn't matter [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=413.0s)]
*  That's the other thing we've realized. She doesn't know how neither do we we'll admit it [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=418.44s)]
*  But what struck us was that she repeats the same line again and again and again and her old reaction [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=422.92s)]
*  This was derision not exactly socrates. That was the phrase we used [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=428.36s)]
*  But that reaction we now see comes from a place of privilege evaluate your priors [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=432.84s)]
*  Deconstruct your unconscious bias and ask yourself [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=438.84s)]
*  Would a moron be capable of repeating the same canned phrase dozens of times with this kind of precision without changing a single facial expression? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh, no [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=450.67999999999995s)]
*  Try that at home. You can't do it. You're too self-aware [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=452.2s)]
*  It's impossible for you [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=457.0s)]
*  But not for kamala harris [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=459.08s)]
*  She's got what it takes to repeat herself verbatim for days at a time [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=461.32s)]
*  Behaving as if each time is the first time [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=467.08s)]
*  We stand corrected and we stand in awe [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  Here she was in may telling us about the importance of and we're quoting [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=476.12s)]
*  working together [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=479.96s)]
*  We will work together and continue to work together [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=481.56s)]
*  To address these issues to tackle these challenges and to work together as we continue to work [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=485.0s)]
*  To work operating from the new norms rules and agreements that we will convene [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=491.64s)]
*  To work together on [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=499.24s)]
*  So again, we laughed at that clip we've done it more than once. It feels good to admit it [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  At the time we assumed kamala harris just got lost in the middle of the sentence. She couldn't find her way out together working together [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  How do I get out of the sentence together? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  But now we see what was really happening here kamala harris [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  Fully understands the importance of working together not just working but together working together [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=520.28s)]
*  And that's not something we should mock that's brilliant and science has proven it's brilliant [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=529.24s)]
*  10 years ago researchers at trinity college in dublin ireland found and we're quoting [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=535.24s)]
*  Proof that evolution of intelligence and larger brain sizes can be driven by [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=540.36s)]
*  Do you know what by and we're quoting? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  Cooperation and teamwork in other words working together [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=547.8599999999999s)]
*  So when kamala harris tells us again and again and again that we need to work together [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  She's not simply repeating some vapid canned sound bite. She's been handed by her handlers. No [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=559.88s)]
*  She's literally literally moving human evolution forward [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=565.88s)]
*  She's making the species better on a cellular level. How long till we can fly? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=572.04s)]
*  If kamala harris keeps it up not long [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  She does this all the time [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  She makes us better and as she does she does her homework [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  As joy reed told us it's the dumbing down of america the dummies here can't see it [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=588.04s)]
*  But kamala harris can because she's done the work [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=593.64s)]
*  Here she was on monday talking to kids at the national museum of african-american history [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=597.0s)]
*  Today is a day to celebrate the principle of freedom [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=601.64s)]
*  And think about it in terms of the context of history [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=605.98s)]
*  Knowing that black people in america were not free for 400 years of slavery [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=611.5s)]
*  Okay, so again there are a couple of different ways to assess that claim the old us [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=618.7800000000001s)]
*  Before we were reborn [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=625.98s)]
*  And since we're dealing in cliches now, we're just going to compare ourselves to a phoenix [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=628.46s)]
*  Before we rose from the ashes anew the old us would have said wait a second kamala harris [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=632.4599999999999s)]
*  African americans weren't actually enslaved for 400 years in this country. That's not true, but we would have missed the point [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=638.62s)]
*  So what happened here is that kamala harris before her talk googled? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=646.62s)]
*  How long was there slavery in america and she saw that it had been 400 years since slavery began in america, which is true [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=649.9s)]
*  But she forgot to subtract the years since the emancipation proclamation [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=655.26s)]
*  It's actually fewer than 400 about a 150 years fewer than 400 which would put us around 250, but whatever [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=660.96s)]
*  The point is that's not her fault [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=668.88s)]
*  It's google's fault for not doing the subtraction for her [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=671.52s)]
*  Talk about falling short of the promise of the internet and who runs google. Hmm. Joy read anyone white men [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=676.48s)]
*  So there's a lot of white supremacy in palo alto california as google has already admitted [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=682.64s)]
*  Not convinced yet. Well, then you're just a bad person and you're also jealous. You know what you're jealous of above all [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=687.52s)]
*  Not just the brilliance not just the tenacity [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  You're jealous of kamala or kamala doesn't matter. You're jealous of her joy [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  What did you think when you watched that hearing? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=703.28s)]
*  I will tell you joy [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=707.6s)]

*  When I watched this brilliant [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=717.36s)]
*  Phenomenal [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=721.58s)]
*  Black woman jurist [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=724.16s)]
*  Be so smart [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=728.08s)]
*  And I watched that with incredible joy [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=730.72s)]
*  Because it was just brilliance [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=733.6s)]
*  being displayed [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=736.24s)]
*  For the entire country to see [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=738.32s)]
*  And I cannot wait to see I that will only be matched by the joy [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  That I experience when I see her take the oath [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=745.68s)]
*  To be the next justice on the united states supreme court [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=750.9599999999999s)]
*  Not just brilliant [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  but also [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=759.3599999999999s)]
*  phenomenal [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=760.8599999999999s)]
*  So ask yourself and be totally honest and put the thresaurus away [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  How many synonyms could you come up with in a row? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=767.28s)]
*  So extemporaneously just top of your head [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=771.52s)]
*  Not just brilliant, but phenomenal. Could you do that? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=776.24s)]
*  No, you couldn't [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=779.6s)]
*  And by the way, you don't have her joy [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=781.04s)]
*  Maybe that's why you don't like her [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roy9DbEzaPY&t=783.6s)]
