# Will Cain: We should be concerned about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU)
*  Well, good evening and welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Will Kane in for Tucker. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=4.24s)]
*  Now if you want to know what is in a bill in Congress and what it's actually going to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=6.44s)]
*  do, take a good look at the name of the bill. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=11.8s)]
*  Whatever it is, you can be sure the legislation will do the exact opposite. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=14.44s)]
*  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, for example, it led to the worst [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=18.86s)]
*  economic recovery this country had seen since World War II. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=23.04s)]
*  The so-called Marketplace Fairness Act is just an internet sales tax, which big companies [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=27.08s)]
*  like Amazon support. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=31.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=33.48s)]
*  Because it helps Amazon price out smaller competitors. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=34.48s)]
*  And according to Congress, that's marketplace fairness. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  So we should all be very nervous, very, very concerned that Congress just passed something [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=40.04s)]
*  called the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  It mandates hundreds of billions of new dollars in spending that will increase the money supply [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=48.44s)]
*  in this country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=53.4s)]
*  And that will in turn devalue the currency and that in turn cause more inflation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=54.54s)]
*  That's basic supply and demand. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=60.92s)]
*  But before we get into the specifics of the legislation, keep in mind, life is already [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=62.78s)]
*  so expensive in this country that we literally have bread lines in major cities. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=67.8s)]
*  Fox's Jeff Flock just spoke to volunteers at one food bank in Camden, New Jersey, who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=72.9s)]
*  say that many people cannot afford rice and beans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=77.22s)]
*  Look at all these people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  This is a line that runs almost around the block here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=82.26s)]
*  Yeah, things cost more. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=87.54s)]
*  And so people that otherwise, you know, you look people and people well dressed in line [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=89.86s)]
*  that you know typically would not be at a food bank, but they are. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=94.5s)]
*  Pre pandemic, we were at Philabundance feeding about 90,000 people per week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=98.18s)]
*  And now we're about 140,000 people per week. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  Rice, pasta, beans. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  We're also finding that finding those items for us is getting to be very expensive as [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=107.46s)]
*  well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  I just want to again show Stuart the line of folks here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  And this is all sorts of folks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  They're families, single people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  A lot of these people would not be in a line to try and get some food. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=119.78s)]
*  That's America. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=125.82s)]
*  And that's happening all across America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  And you have to wonder why then is the Biden administration devaluing money when we have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=128.74s)]
*  bread lines? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=133.34s)]
*  Well, their justification for the bill is that it will stop the climate from changing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=134.82s)]
*  That's why the bill includes $50 billion in subsidies for electric vehicle purchases, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=140.46s)]
*  which by the way will lead manufacturers to jack up the price of electric vehicles. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=145.1s)]
*  We've learned that lesson from health care subsidies and subsidies for college tuition. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=149.22s)]
*  There's also billions of dollars for the Postal Service to buy new mail trucks that don't [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=153.78s)]
*  pollute as much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=157.94s)]
*  And of course, there's $100 billion for the so-called renewable industry. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=159.3s)]
*  That includes manufacturers of solar panels and wind turbines. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=164.5s)]
*  So is that a good investment? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=167.9s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=170.5s)]
*  Right now, virtually every major renewable manufacturer is based in China. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=171.5s)]
*  China makes 80% of the world's solar panels and most of the world's wind turbines. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=175.78s)]
*  So it's safe to say China understands renewables. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=179.58s)]
*  But here's the revealing thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=183.46s)]
*  China is not relying on those renewables for power generation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=185.7s)]
*  Take a look at this chart. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=190.02s)]
*  It shows annual carbon emissions from China, the U.S., and Europe, going back to the 70s. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=191.02s)]
*  Notice our emissions have been going down for years. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=195.74s)]
*  China's by contrast has been rising dramatically. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=197.9s)]
*  That's because they're not shutting down their coal plants. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=201.82s)]
*  In fact, they're building more coal plants than the rest of the world combined. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=203.74s)]
*  What that means is that China wants the rest of the world to run on so-called renewables, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=208.9s)]
*  that China doesn't want renewables for themselves. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=213.94s)]
*  And that's because China benefits financially and strategically when Western countries sabotage [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=217.62s)]
*  their own energy supply in the name of protecting the climate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=222.66s)]
*  But like any good dealer, they don't get high on their own supply. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=226.18s)]
*  And most Americans recognize that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=229.9s)]
*  Take a look at this recent tweet from Rasmussen, the polling outfit. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=232.38s)]
*  People in this country care about, of course, things like inflation, the economy, crime, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=236.14s)]
*  immigration. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=241.38s)]
*  By contrast, most Americans recognize the media is far more interested in pushing false [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=242.38s)]
*  narratives about climate change. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=247.22s)]
*  And there's good reason for that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=249.74s)]
*  You'll notice no one in the media ever blames countries like China or India for their carbon [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=251.78s)]
*  emissions, even though they are the world's largest polluters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=255.7s)]
*  Instead, the media blames Americans. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=260.62s)]
*  It's almost a privilege to care about inflation as your number one issue. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=263.26s)]
*  The same is true of gas prices or even the idea that it's the economy, stupid. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=269.38s)]
*  I always found that analysis lacking because as a black person, I don't want to get killed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=274.1s)]
*  on the way to my job. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=279.06s)]
*  So I'm glad I have a job. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=280.82s)]
*  I'm glad I make a living wage. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=282.42s)]
*  But if I can't be alive, then what does that other stuff matter? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=284.5s)]
*  That's a television host in a television studio lecturing people standing in breadlines about [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=291.42s)]
*  their privilege. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=296.98s)]
*  And by the way, this is how the White House views inflation as well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=298.86s)]
*  They're openly mocking anyone who is concerned about inflation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=301.74s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, to illustrate the point, the Biden administration just approved a $300,000 grant to promote [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  gay and transgender social acceptance in Botswana. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=311.42s)]
*  The Daily Caller is reporting that African country can expect the funds anytime soon. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=316.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, Americans can't afford rice and beans. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=320.82s)]
*  It's such an obvious failure of leadership. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  No one can defend this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=326.66s)]
*  At MSNBC, they've been reduced to this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=328.62s)]
*  If you just lost your house because of a flood in Kentucky, if you just lost your livelihood [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=331.70000000000005s)]
*  because it burnt down in a wildfire, if you just lost your life because you are the wrong [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=337.5s)]
*  color and you were pulled over somewhere, inflation doesn't really matter to you or [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=343.5s)]
*  to your loved ones. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  There are much broader things going on right now in this country that affects so many demographics. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=350.94000000000005s)]
*  That the dollars to cents case that has been made time and again about, like you said, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  it's the economy stupid. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=361.9s)]
*  There's a blind spot there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  And you'll notice that the majority of people who make that statement are generally white. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=365.46s)]
*  Inflation, recession, that's not really what matters in life. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=371.18s)]
*  If you notice the footage we showed you earlier about the bread lines, not a racial issue. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=374.86s)]
*  Inflation hurts poor Americans the most, and that happens to cut across racial lines. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=379.38s)]
*  So why are we really making inflation worse? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=384.34s)]
*  If it's not to save the climate and it's not about punishing privileged Americans, what's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=387.14s)]
*  the point? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=392.46s)]
*  Here's one clue. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  Buried in the bill is a big giveaway to the Internal Revenue Service. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=395.17999999999995s)]
*  The agency stands to gain $80 billion from this legislation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=397.62s)]
*  That will allow the agency to hire more than 80,000 new agents. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=401.97999999999996s)]
*  Keep in mind, the IRS is already wonderfully, mysteriously heavily militarized. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=406.26s)]
*  They've stockpiled thousands of firearms and millions of rounds of ammunition. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=414.02s)]
*  Why does the IRS need all that weaponry? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  Why do we need to make the IRS even more powerful, exactly? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=420.9s)]
*  We know the point isn't to investigate wealthy or powerful Americans. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=426.08s)]
*  The most recent version of the bill keeps the carried interest loophole intact. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=430.85999999999996s)]
*  Now, that benefits wealthy individuals and institutions, in particular hedge fund managers, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02uSKPOMnU&t=436.26s)]
