# Hillary Clinton is begging Democrats to consider her again: Devine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk)
*  Poor Hillary can't let it go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=0.0s)]
*  Miranda Devine's a columnist for the New York Post [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  and she joins us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=5.48s)]
*  Does the country deserve that, Miranda? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=7.92s)]
*  Do we deserve a rematch of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=10.4s)]
*  Is this really a possibility? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=14.52s)]
*  Well, Jesse, I think it tells you more about the state [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=19.16s)]
*  of the Democratic Party than it does about poor America, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=22.12s)]
*  that they're even considering Hillary Clinton, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  that she isn't just being laughed out of school [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=28.36s)]
*  for popping her head up above the parapet [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=31.0s)]
*  from so desperately and so obviously [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=34.36s)]
*  having her hand up and saying, pick me, pick me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=37.44s)]
*  You know, the masterclass, so-called, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=40.72s)]
*  that she gave the other day [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=43.08s)]
*  that people paid $20 a month to watch [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  in which she read her undelivered victory speech [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=47.32s)]
*  and then cried at the end of it with no real tears. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=50.72s)]
*  That was the number one, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=54.66s)]
*  that was her begging the American people [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=56.42s)]
*  and begging the Democratic Party to look at her [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  as the alternative to Joe Biden [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=62.14s)]
*  because after all, she is younger than him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=64.4s)]
*  She will only be 78 come 2024, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=67.38s)]
*  so she'll be the same age that he is now [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  or a little bit younger. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=74.5s)]
*  And she's also a year younger than Donald Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=75.98s)]
*  and she's always telling us, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=78.5s)]
*  she's been doing interviews repeatedly saying [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=80.34s)]
*  that Donald Trump is going to run again in 2024, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=83.9s)]
*  that that is an existential threat to democracy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=87.54s)]
*  It's going to be a nightmare. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=91.44s)]
*  And really the subtext is that only Hillary Clinton, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=93.1s)]
*  who was so narrowly cheated a victory [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=96.82s)]
*  against Donald Trump in 2016, only she can save America. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=99.14s)]
*  And that's her shtick. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=103.7s)]
*  She won't stop at, she'll do it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=105.7s)]
*  I mean, she, till her last breath, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=108.42s)]
*  she wants to vindicate herself. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=110.78s)]
*  And you know, if Hillary Clinton is going to get in, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=112.86s)]
*  Trump's going to get in because he knows how to beat her. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=115.9s)]
*  He's got her number. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=118.82s)]
*  He did it before. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=119.78s)]
*  He thinks he can do it again. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=120.62s)]
*  But if Trump is definitely running, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=122.3s)]
*  then the Democrats are going to say, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=124.14s)]
*  Biden, you can't step down, you have to run. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=125.26s)]
*  Hillary Clinton can't beat Donald Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=128.42s)]
*  You're the only one to beat Donald. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=130.3s)]
*  You beat him before, you got to do it again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=131.86s)]
*  Just beat him and then resign a week later. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=134.3s)]
*  So you have like three big names circling each other. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  Bernie Sanders must be sitting there thinking like, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=141.06s)]
*  oh my God, do I have to get in? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=144.22s)]
*  Well, but spare a thought [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=149.22s)]
*  for the younger generation of Democrats. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  They don't have a chance because these people, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=153.06s)]
*  you know, they're in close to their 80s. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  Face it, they're octogenarians. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  And they just are clinging onto power for all it's worth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  Will not give any oxygen to anybody who's younger. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  It's left the Democratic Party with a dearth of leadership. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=168.38s)]
*  You look at the Republican side, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=172.06s)]
*  there's any number of people that could step up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=173.66s)]
*  But on the Democrats, who is there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=176.26s)]
*  that is actually palatable to the American people? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=177.78s)]
*  And I don't think that Biden would beat Donald Trump again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=180.7s)]
*  I don't either. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=184.22s)]
*  The polls are showing that's not true. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=185.06s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=186.18s)]
*  And too many people see who he really is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=187.02s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  AOC is probably licking her chops at this setup. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=190.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  And that, talk about unpalatable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=195.26s)]
*  We're in for a five car pileup in 2024. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=198.18s)]
*  Miranda Devine, thank you so much. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVoNrbLBkk&t=202.62s)]
