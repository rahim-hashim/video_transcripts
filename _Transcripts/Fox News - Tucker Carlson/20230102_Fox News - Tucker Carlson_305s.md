# Mike Rowe and Tucker react to TikTok 'influencer's' 'My Day At Work' video
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js)
*  So if you go on TikTok, you may have concerns [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=0.0s)]
*  about the state of the American economy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=3.1s)]
*  There are a lot of young white collar employees, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=4.54s)]
*  marketing majors from Davidson, filming themselves at work, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=7.8s)]
*  and it turns out they don't do a lot. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  They take a lot of breaks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=15.5s)]
*  We're not being mean. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=17.52s)]
*  These are their words. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=18.96s)]
*  Here's a Twitter employee from San Francisco. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=20.1s)]
*  Welcome to a day in my life as a Twitter employee. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=23.06s)]
*  So this past week went to SF [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  for the first time at a Twitter office, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=28.82s)]
*  badged in, honestly took a moment [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  to just soak everything in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=34.14s)]
*  What a blessing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=35.54s)]
*  Also started my morning off [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=37.04s)]
*  with an iced matcha from the pit. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=38.46s)]
*  Then I had a meeting, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=40.78s)]
*  so quickly scheduled one of these little pod rooms, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=41.94s)]
*  which were so cool. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  They're literally noise canceling. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=46.66s)]
*  Took my meeting, got ready for a bunch. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=48.22s)]
*  Look how delicious this food looks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=50.94s)]
*  Oh my goodness, I was so overwhelmed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  Then made my way down to this log cabin area. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=56.54s)]
*  I don't know what this is, but it was really cool. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=59.02s)]
*  Played some foosball with my friends [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=61.82s)]
*  to kind of unwind a bit. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  Also found this really cool meditation room. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=67.14s)]
*  Mike Rowe has spent his life reporting on work, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=69.86s)]
*  and in fact working. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  He saw that segment and reached out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=74.86s)]
*  and said it's more important than ever [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=79.38s)]
*  to show the fact that a lot of Americans [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=81.22s)]
*  are doing real work. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=83.54s)]
*  In fact, he's got a whole show about this called Dirty Job. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=85.3s)]
*  He's been on the air for 20 years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=87.5s)]
*  He's also the host of How America Works on Fox Nation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=89.3s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  Mike Rowe, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=92.38s)]
*  When we did that segment, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=93.66s)]
*  I thought of you banging out the script the whole time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  This is the opposite of the kind of actual work [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=98.3s)]
*  Mike Rowe has dedicated his life [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=101.58s)]
*  to telling the rest of us about. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=102.86s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't tell me you were gonna do that segment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Had I known, I would have insisted [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=107.34s)]
*  on following it up with something. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  So thank you for the chance to do that now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=110.94s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=113.1s)]
*  I have to say, I can't speak really for anybody but me, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=113.94s)]
*  but I would bet big that millions and millions of people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=117.3s)]
*  jumped out of their chairs, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  screamed words we can't repeat on your program [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  as a result of watching what you showed them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=126.66s)]
*  And look, again, it's not about being mean, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=128.78s)]
*  but our relationship with work, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=132.26s)]
*  our definition of what a good job is, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=134.82s)]
*  that's something we can control. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=137.82s)]
*  And you're so right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=139.8s)]
*  Portrayals of work shift with time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=141.9s)]
*  And I think part of the reason Dirty Jobs [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  has been on the air for the last 20 years [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=147.46s)]
*  is we are the antidote to what you just showed America. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=149.62s)]
*  We go to places where there's no meditation room. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=155.66s)]
*  There's no five-star breakfast to start the day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  There's the bag house at the asphalt plant. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  There are just example after example after example, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=166.86s)]
*  350 jobs we've done so far of people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=171.18s)]
*  who are still doing things that look like work. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=175.02s)]
*  So we can talk about a ton of different things, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=177.02s)]
*  but fundamentally our country still needs to be reminded [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  of what, forgive me, I'm just gonna say it, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=182.5s)]
*  what real work looks like. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=185.78s)]
*  Well, it's just interesting that what you're calling [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  real work is provably real, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=190.82s)]
*  because it's the work that if people stopped doing, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=193.3s)]
*  we would all pay for immediately. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  Like we would die in a lot of cases. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=198.82s)]
*  This is the actual indispensable work. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  Look, and it makes us angry to be reminded of that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=205.22s)]
*  because we don't like the idea that we're so reliant [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=208.94s)]
*  and so dependent on such a small and marginalized chunk [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  of our workforce, but it's the truth. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=215.5s)]
*  Look, this episode's about good news, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=217.94s)]
*  so let me give you some. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  MicroWorks, my foundation, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=221.82s)]
*  evolved out of Dirty Jobs 15 years ago. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=223.73999999999998s)]
*  With your help and a lot of appearances on your show [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=226.42s)]
*  over the last however many years, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=229.18s)]
*  we've raised over $6 million in work ethic scholarships, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=231.46s)]
*  and we've awarded that money to over 1,500 people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=235.5s)]
*  who are now welding and steam fitting and pipe fitting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=238.9s)]
*  and plumbing, and they're thriving, Tucker. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=242.34s)]
*  Again and again and again, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=245.9s)]
*  we see that it's still possible to achieve something [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  that looks like prosperity if you begin by mastering [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=249.94s)]
*  a skill that's in demand. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  Shameless plug, we're gonna do it again next month. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=255.3s)]
*  Work ethic scholarships at microworks.org. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=258.3s)]
*  We're moving the needle in a modest way, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  but it starts by tapping the country on the shoulder [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  as you have done and reminding them [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=267.18s)]
*  that real jobs still exist. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=270.06s)]
*  11 million of them are out there right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  The opportunities are everywhere. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=274.74s)]
*  Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=277.62s)]
*  And they should have higher status. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=279.74s)]
*  I mean, I love what you said about [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=281.18s)]
*  these are marginalized people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  These are the people, the guys who work at Asphalt Plants [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=284.98s)]
*  who make it possible for us to travel are marginalized. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=287.18s)]
*  And that should not be the case. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=290.1s)]
*  And thank you for everything you're doing to change that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=291.22s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DD352it0Js&t=294.46s)]
