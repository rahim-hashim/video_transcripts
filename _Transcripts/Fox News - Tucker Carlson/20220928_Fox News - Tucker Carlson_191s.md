# Here's a behind-the-scenes look at Dana White's office and gym
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs)
*  So the UFC Ultimate Fighting Champion has become the fastest growing sport in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=0.0s)]
*  As we told you, we just came back from Las Vegas because we wanted to meet the president of UFC, Dana White, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=5.5s)]
*  who actually runs it, really does run it in a way that no other person runs an entire sport. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=10.8s)]
*  We played the first part of our interview yesterday, but UFC is really a lot more than boxing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=15.8s)]
*  It's basically replaced boxing in the combat sports, and it's an amalgam of all kinds of different martial arts, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=22.1s)]
*  wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, a lot of other disciplines. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=28.700000000000003s)]
*  So we're doing a whole documentary on this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=31.5s)]
*  And while we were talking and we asked, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=33.6s)]
*  hey, we'd love to see your personal office because we'd heard it was pretty unbelievable, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=35.9s)]
*  but we couldn't even imagine what it was actually like because it was that unbelievable. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=40.300000000000004s)]
*  And hopefully we captured the sense of it on tape. Here it is. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=44.6s)]
*  This is insane. I love this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  I said saber tooth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=52.6s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=54.8s)]
*  That's real. That's a saber tooth tiger. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=55.6s)]
*  That's probably the nicest saber tooth tiger skull you'll ever see. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=59.4s)]
*  I've never seen a saber tooth tiger skull. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=62.7s)]
*  What's that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=65.2s)]
*  This, so this, oh, I'll explain both these. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=66.2s)]
*  So first the gun. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=68.6s)]
*  The gun represents war. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=70.0s)]
*  War is all about killing with the gun and the knife. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=71.9s)]
*  War is all about money. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=74.4s)]
*  And then the clip is all the things we kill for. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=76.0s)]
*  Oil, cocaine, gold, blood, diamonds, religious symbol, and the seeds that make heroin on the bottom there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=78.7s)]
*  Then the guy, the artist found out that I had it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=85.9s)]
*  Showed up here one day and gave me the grenade. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=88.4s)]
*  This is my closet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=93.0s)]
*  Whoa, look at that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like shoes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=96.2s)]
*  And the shoes around the top are some of the rarest shoes in the world, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=98.0s)]
*  but like, you know, the hard to get Air Jordans and Nikes and all that stuff. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=101.4s)]
*  That's quite a collection. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=107.9s)]
*  Yeah, I got a crazy collection. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  And this is what I'm addicted to right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=113.5s)]
*  This cold plunge. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  You do that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=117.4s)]
*  I start with the cold and go to the heat and go back, back. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=118.2s)]
*  You do three, four times. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=121.3s)]
*  Your gym. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=123.3s)]
*  My gym. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=124.0s)]
*  So I work out here every morning and then start my day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=128.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=131.7s)]
*  What's that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=133.1s)]
*  Oh, so that's something that we've been working on and developing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=133.6s)]
*  So, you know, when you work out in the sport, you know, you got to get somebody to hold the pads for you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=136.6s)]
*  So we're trying to figure out a way where these guys don't need somebody to hold the pads and you put on, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  you know, a guy on here telling you what to throw and what to do and kind of a workout. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  We've been developing this thing for a couple years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=154.5s)]
*  How's it working? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  It's coming together. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=159.5s)]
*  There's some resistance. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=161.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's coming together, but you can do everything. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=164.2s)]
*  You can punch, you can knee, you can kick. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  You can do everything with it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=169.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  What an interesting guy and what a decent guy actually don't run into too many people like that anymore. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=174.2s)]
*  Our documentary on Dana White and the UFC will be out this winter at Tucker Carlson Original. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=183.6s)]
*  You can stream it on Fox Nation when it's done. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WaUOwqZqs&t=188.29999999999998s)]
