# JD Vance: Biden's student loan handout doesn't benefit borrowers
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ)
*  J.D. Vance is very well educated and still very sensible. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Running for Senate in Ohio, he joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  J.D. Vance, I know that you are very concerned [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=5.3s)]
*  about student loan debt. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=7.18s)]
*  Any personal looks at the numbers is. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=8.02s)]
*  Is this the way to address it? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=9.6s)]
*  I know it's certainly not, Tucker. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=13.16s)]
*  I mean, you hit the nail on the head [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=14.4s)]
*  that this is effectively a bailout [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=15.66s)]
*  for a super corrupt educational system. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=17.42s)]
*  The Harvard Endowment has $60 billion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  The Yale Endowment has $40 billion. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=21.68s)]
*  If you want to give student debt relief, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=23.68s)]
*  you should penalize the people who have benefited [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  from this very corrupt system. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=28.54s)]
*  Not ask plumbers in Ohio to subsidize the life decisions [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=30.18s)]
*  of college-educated young people, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=34.46s)]
*  primarily young people who are gonna make a lot of money [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=36.9s)]
*  over the course of their lifetime anyway. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=38.94s)]
*  So no, this is exactly the wrong way to do it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=40.98s)]
*  And again, if you give this bailout [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=43.46s)]
*  to these university administrators, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=45.58s)]
*  they're gonna keep doubling down on what they've done, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=47.0s)]
*  which is effectively indoctrinating our kids, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  not educating them, not giving them the useful skills [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=51.42s)]
*  for the job market, but indoctrinating them [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=54.18s)]
*  and getting a massive windfall from Joe Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  in the process. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=58.54s)]
*  It's really, really corrupt, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  and it's gonna make that corrupt system live even longer. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=60.86s)]
*  I just don't understand why Republicans [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=64.14s)]
*  don't say anything about this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=65.34s)]
*  Everybody understands that students are so crippled by debt [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=66.46s)]
*  they can't begin adult lives, okay? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=71.32s)]
*  That's a real problem, and we should not deny it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=73.38s)]
*  But the people who caused the problem, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=76.17999999999999s)]
*  who benefited from the problem, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=78.1s)]
*  who defrauded these students are not paying. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=79.3s)]
*  Like, why is it so hard for Republicans to say, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=82.34s)]
*  hey, Yale, it's time for you to pay reparations [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=84.46s)]
*  to your students? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=87.33999999999999s)]
*  Not only are they not paying, Tucker, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=90.14s)]
*  they're actually being rewarded by this policy, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  and that's what makes it such a huge mistake. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  And I gotta say, Tucker, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=95.66s)]
*  there is a political dimension to this, of course. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  I'm running against Tim Ryan, Democrat from Ohio, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=98.66s)]
*  who's been on every side, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  he's flip-flopped on every side of this student debt issue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  But if you think about this, two months before the election, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden has given a massive windfall [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=107.41999999999999s)]
*  to Democratic Party donors. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=109.72s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why I'd encourage people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=111.22s)]
*  to help us fight back at JDVance.com. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=112.66s)]
*  But this has very direct implications [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=115.5s)]
*  for the middle class in this country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=118.96s)]
*  Tucker, you know as well as anybody [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=120.58s)]
*  that if you look behind a lot of our bad policies, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=122.66s)]
*  whether it's the student bailouts, the globalization, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=125.3s)]
*  moving stuff to China, whatever you wanna say, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=128.12s)]
*  it's very often a massive transfer of wealth [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  from middle-class, hardworking people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=133.98s)]
*  to the upper class in this country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=136.14s)]
*  That's exactly what this is, a massive bailout [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=137.5s)]
*  for people who've made bad decisions [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=140.82s)]
*  and are doing very well economically. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=143.14s)]
*  When I say that, I mean the college administrators, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  of course, it's hard to imagine a worse policy, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=146.22s)]
*  a policy that solves few of our problems [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  and harms much more people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  And rewards the worst people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=154.94s)]
*  It really does. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=156.5s)]
*  I appreciate you're coming on, JDVance. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=157.98s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=159.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrZ6vHiSJdQ&t=172.42s)]
