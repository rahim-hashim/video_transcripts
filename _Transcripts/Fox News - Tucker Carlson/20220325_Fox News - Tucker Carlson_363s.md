# Prime time # 99 Alex Stein goes viral
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c)
*  It wasn't so long ago that a guy from Dallas, Texas called Alex Stein started showing up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=0.0s)]
*  at city council meetings across Texas, but politicians never paid attention to him. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=4.8s)]
*  He's a citizen, but they were not that interested, so he decided on a new approach. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Alex Stein adopted the alter ego, primetime number 99, Alex Stein. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=13.56s)]
*  He became a lot more voluble and in the process showed us how unhinged our own leaders have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  become. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Here, for example, is Alex Stein at a recent meeting of the Dallas City Council explaining [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=28.72s)]
*  why mandatory vaccinations are essential. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=32.4s)]
*  You gotta mandate vaccines because right now I am losing housekeepers left and right because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=35.32s)]
*  listen, every time the service sends a housekeeper to my house and they test positive for coronavirus, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I can't have them work around my kids. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=45.84s)]
*  I have two trans kids at my house, both on puberty blockers, and you realize they are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=47.28s)]
*  vulnerable, they're immune to compromise. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  We need more people vaccinated. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=52.0s)]
*  They thought that was real. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=55.96s)]
*  Probably a compelling argument, actually. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=57.36s)]
*  Then Stein went to Richardson, Texas and tried to convince the city council to start World [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=59.68s)]
*  War III. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=64.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=65.4s)]
*  I'm a sergeant in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion and I'm here today to recruit some of you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=66.4s)]
*  to go fight in the war in World War III. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=72.68s)]
*  When you join Ukraine's Foreign Legion, we're going to train you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=75.4s)]
*  You don't even need any training. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=79.72s)]
*  We're going to teach you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=80.72s)]
*  As a matter of fact, we'd prefer if you didn't have training because we don't want somebody [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=81.72s)]
*  that's all messed up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=84.76s)]
*  We want to teach you your gun skills. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=85.92s)]
*  You are a coward and I'm a hero. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  This is a hero. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=89.92s)]
*  You would never know what it's like, Paul, to be like this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=91.92s)]
*  You will never know what it's like to be president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=94.92s)]
*  You will never know. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=96.92s)]
*  And you will never fight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=97.92s)]
*  And you will be on the wrong side of history. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=98.92s)]
*  And all you have to do is sign up on this forum right now and you can go fight. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=100.92s)]
*  Thank you for your public comments. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=104.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=105.92s)]
*  Your time is over. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=106.92s)]
*  You can watch a lot of those on YouTube. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=107.92s)]
*  Spend an entire afternoon chuckling and learning. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=111.08s)]
*  Alex Stein is the host of the Conspiracy Castle with number 99 Alex Stein. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=115.08s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us for the first time tonight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=119.08s)]
*  Alex Stein, it's great to meet you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=121.08s)]
*  How did you start? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=122.08s)]
*  How did you start doing this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=123.08s)]
*  Tucker, man, it's such a pleasure. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=125.08s)]
*  But let me tell you something, because we're under constant trauma-based mind control from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=127.08s)]
*  the media. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=130.08s)]
*  So what I did is I said, I'm not going to just lay down and let them control my life. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=131.08s)]
*  So I said, I'm going to go start talking to these politicians. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=134.08s)]
*  And I was dead serious at first. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=136.08s)]
*  They disregarded me. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=138.08s)]
*  When I said I didn't really think the lockdowns were effective, they didn't pay attention. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=139.24s)]
*  So the crazier I got, I realized that's how you invoke a response. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=142.24s)]
*  These people are what I call non-playable characters in the video game of life. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=146.24s)]
*  They don't want to interact with us. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=149.24s)]
*  When they get elected, they think all of a sudden we work for them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=150.24s)]
*  And that's not the case. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=153.24s)]
*  So what I'm trying to do is I'm just trying to put a mirror up to the mainstream media [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  and show what the narrative is and how idiotic it is, because everything I say is just regurgitated [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  from Brian Stelter or Don Lemon and some idiot at CNN. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  So it's really actually pretty easy doing what I do, Tucker. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=167.08s)]
*  Well, there's a lot to it back. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=170.08s)]
*  But I want to go back to the first sentence. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=172.08s)]
*  What is trauma based mind control? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=174.08s)]
*  Well, it's actually when you turn on CNN, every single second, they're going to see a death scroll. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=177.08s)]
*  They're going to try to scare you because that's how they control you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=181.08s)]
*  They want to keep us in what is called fight or flight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=183.08s)]
*  They want everybody scared out of their mind so they can't make a decision. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=185.08s)]
*  They don't they don't only want us to see one inch in front of our face so we can't see the big picture. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=189.08s)]
*  Because what happens is we have what is called the Mockingbird Media. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=193.08s)]
*  They admit the CIA has liaisons in every single form of our entertainment from the radio, television, news and film. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=196.08s)]
*  So you have a media that will say Hunter Biden's laptop is fake, yet they have to come out six months later and say, oh, no, that's real. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=202.08s)]
*  And they're going to give us the crack pipe all day long. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=208.08s)]
*  Yet on that same laptop, there's supposedly child pornography on it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=210.08s)]
*  And these people don't care. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=213.08s)]
*  Look at Kenchaji Brown Jackson, who's about to be nominated to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=214.08s)]
*  She's easy on child pornography. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=217.08s)]
*  Do you think that's an accident, Tucker? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=219.08s)]
*  None of this is done on accident. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=221.08s)]
*  It is a purposeful destabilization of the middle class. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=222.08s)]
*  And that's what I am. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=225.08s)]
*  I'm a middle class person trying to save it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=226.08s)]
*  And I'm not here to virtue signal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=228.08s)]
*  I'm just saying I'm tired of being tinkled on and the government telling me it's raining. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=229.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=234.08s)]
*  I agree. I agree with that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=235.08s)]
*  And you don't need to be a meteorologist to know when you're being tinkled on, I would say. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=236.08s)]
*  So what? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=240.08s)]
*  What? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=241.08s)]
*  What's the response? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=242.08s)]
*  You sort of have as you watch the city council members a little bit of contempt because they should know this is they're being played. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=244.08s)]
*  But you also feel a little sorry for because they're totally overwhelmed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=251.08s)]
*  Like, what do they say to you? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=254.08s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is when you go to these meetings, Tucker, a lot of times people are nervous at the podium. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=255.08s)]
*  I see people talking about how child protective services took their kids or their neighbors house caught on fire and their house got burned up and nobody's helping them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  So people are nervous. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  So what I try to do is I try to put the heat on them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  I want to make the politicians nervous of what I'm going to do. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  And the reason why is you go out there and all day long, the news is going to tell us about the border between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  But I'm in Dallas, Texas, and the border between Texas and Mexico right now is just being flooded with sex trafficking, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  with the Chinese fentanyl that I've had friends and family die of. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=282.08s)]
*  So the real war is right here in America. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=285.08s)]
*  Yet that this Biden administration wants to just confuse us and make us think that it's a valid excuse to go fight World War Three. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=287.08s)]
*  Yet the military industrial complex just lost a 20 year war in Afghanistan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=294.08s)]
*  And now they are chomping at the bit because Tucker, the reason is, is our country is not being run by human beings. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=299.08s)]
*  It's being run by multinational corporations that actually want to destabilize America in order to gain a global control. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=304.08s)]
*  And that's what's happening. You look at these companies like Halliburton, you just look at all these companies that are destroying America on purpose, in my opinion, Tucker. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=311.08s)]
*  So you're not going to be on YouTube long, obviously. So I would just like to get back to her. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=317.08s)]
*  No, I'm not. No, you're not. No, you're not. Yes, they are. Yes. Yes, they are. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=322.08s)]
*  Alex Stein. So if you want to catch the art he's already created, do so now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=326.08s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight, Alex Stein. Good to see you. Thank you, Tucker. You're a hero. Hey, Tucker, one last thing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=330.08s)]
*  Everybody says I'm baby Tucker. So if you're willing to submit to a DNA test and prove you're not my father, I'd appreciate it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=334.08s)]
*  Because we're both good looking. We're both funny. We might be related. And you're my hero. Thank you, Tucker, again. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=340.08s)]
*  I don't think I'm old enough, but I appreciate the compliment. Alex Stein, thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsQD_5JF8c&t=346.08s)]
