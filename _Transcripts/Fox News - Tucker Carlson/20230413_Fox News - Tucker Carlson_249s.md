# Tucker says hello to beloved rodent couple fought the state to keep
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg)
*  So three years ago, a man called Denny Lacoste [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=0.0s)]
*  was driving near New Orleans when he came across [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=3.46s)]
*  a tiny nutria on the side of the road. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=5.58s)]
*  The rodent siblings had just been hit by a car, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=8.88s)]
*  unfortunately, so Denny Lacoste jumped into action, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=11.06s)]
*  scooped up the little guy, and rescued him. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=14.5s)]
*  He gave the animal the name Nudie and raised him as a pet. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=18.16s)]
*  Nudie is a local celebrity, not surprisingly. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=21.84s)]
*  He's also a regular at Denny Lacoste's seafood restaurant, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=25.02s)]
*  Dennis Seafood in Meadoway, Louisiana. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=27.8s)]
*  So recently, the state of Louisiana, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=30.6s)]
*  because they've solved all other problems, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=32.2s)]
*  tried to seize Nudie the pet nutria [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=33.84s)]
*  on public health grounds. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=37.32s)]
*  But Denny Lacoste and his brave wife Myra [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=38.96s)]
*  stood up to the government, and now they've gotten word, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  yes, the man will let them keep the rodent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=43.52s)]
*  Dennis and Myra Lacoste, join us now along with Nudie. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=47.24s)]
*  Mr. and Mrs. Lacoste, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=49.8s)]
*  I'm glad to meet Nudie, and I just want to thank you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=52.16s)]
*  on behalf of all animal lovers for your bravery [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=54.28s)]
*  in the face of state interference. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=56.88s)]
*  Why was it so important for you to keep this pet? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=59.580000000000005s)]
*  He was just a little hurt animal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  We felt sorry for him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  He was so cute, he fit in the palm of my hand, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=68.8s)]
*  and he was very fluffy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=71.06s)]
*  Well, he looks like he still is. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=73.84s)]
*  So nutria, I'm embarrassed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm not even sure I'm pronouncing correctly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=77.0s)]
*  Is it nutria or nutria? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=78.56s)]
*  Nutria. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=81.66s)]
*  Nutria, okay. You're saying it right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=82.92s)]
*  We'll take a middle grab. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=84.44s)]
*  They're rodents, but when you get close to them, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=86.12s)]
*  they're incredibly cute. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Why is the state against them? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=91.6s)]
*  They cause a lot of damage to the wetlands. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=97.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=99.88s)]
*  They destroy our local canals too. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=101.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, I did know that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=103.8s)]
*  But he's in your living room, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=105.72s)]
*  so it doesn't seem like he's a threat [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=106.96s)]
*  to your waterways in Louisiana. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=108.24s)]
*  What do you feed him? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=109.92s)]
*  Oh, no, he's sweet potatoes, corn on a cob. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=110.88s)]
*  Popeyes chicken. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=116.36s)]
*  Pancakes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=118.76s)]
*  A lot of fruit and vegetables. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=121.4s)]
*  I've got a similar diet actually. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=122.24s)]
*  I'm not even a rodent. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=124.12s)]
*  How does he eat fried chicken and milk bones? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=126.52s)]
*  Right now he's eating a crawfish claw, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=131.36s)]
*  a boiled crawfish claw. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=134.04s)]
*  He loves boiled crawfish. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=135.44s)]
*  He lucked out in getting adopted. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=138.68s)]
*  I mean, so he was literally adopted [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=141.36s)]
*  by people who have a famous restaurant. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=142.64s)]
*  So that's pretty good. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=144.1s)]
*  If you're a stranded orphaned rodent, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=145.24s)]
*  that's a pretty good stroke of luck. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=150.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=150.96s)]
*  Yes, he is a lucky one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=152.88s)]
*  He has it made. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=154.16s)]
*  I wanna ask you to be honest for one second. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=157.16s)]
*  Are there any downsides to adopting an enormous rodent? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=158.94s)]
*  Yeah, he's a lot of work. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=165.4s)]
*  He's a lot of work. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=167.72s)]
*  He kinda listens like a cat, not too good. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=168.96s)]
*  Too good, kidding. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  Can you be more specific? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=173.28s)]
*  Because I have the feeling a lot of our viewers [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=174.4s)]
*  are gonna run out and try to adopt a nutria. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=176.28s)]
*  What would you caution him? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=178.6s)]
*  No, don't go get a nutria, no. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=179.44s)]
*  They can destroy your inside of your house really quickly. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=182.88s)]
*  Besides eating pancakes and stuff like that, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=186.16s)]
*  he loves wires. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  He eats them by sofa wires. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, any kind of wires. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=192.84s)]
*  Phone chargers, you gotta pick all that up. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why he loves wires. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=196.44s)]
*  Wow, well you are giving a lot. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=199.32s)]
*  You are giving, other than that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=202.24s)]
*  Does he sleep at all? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Would work. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=206.28s)]
*  Oh, he sleeps all night. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=208.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=209.68s)]
*  He'll take a towel and go into the hall bathroom [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=210.6s)]
*  and make a nest, and he'll walk around the house [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=212.68s)]
*  and grab all the dog toys and shoes, hats, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=215.28s)]
*  whatever is on the floor, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=218.0s)]
*  and he'll go into the hall bathroom, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  and once he goes into the bathroom, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  he's done for the night. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=222.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's not nocturnal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=223.76s)]
*  He got trained when I was scheduled. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=225.4s)]
*  He's on our schedule, yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=227.24s)]
*  Good, that's the spirit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=228.08s)]
*  You gotta make the rodents obey. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=228.9s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=230.72s)]
*  Dennis Amaro-Lacosta, thank you so much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=231.56s)]
*  Nudie, great to meet you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=233.4s)]
*  Appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=235.32s)]
*  Thank you, same to you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsPuo_c-0kg&t=236.16s)]
