# College student who questioned Brian Stelter speaks out
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0)
*  So from our irony fouls, this is like one of the greatest stories ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  So the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics and the Atlantic magazine just hosted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=6.9s)]
*  a conference, no self-warners whatsoever, entitled Disinformation and the Erosion of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=11.26s)]
*  Democracy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=16.96s)]
*  So they say they invited all of your favorite purveyors of disinformation and exponents [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=18.48s)]
*  of censorship, Barack Obama, John Kohlberg, and Applebaum, and of course, Brian Stelter. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=23.1s)]
*  There was no IQ bar, apparently. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=27.94s)]
*  What the speakers didn't count on, the expected hours of just blooviating, is that there are [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=30.540000000000003s)]
*  still a couple of kids at the University of Chicago who are awake enough to say, wait [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=35.260000000000005s)]
*  a second, what are you talking about? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  Disinformation? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=42.54s)]
*  Here's one exchange. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=43.78s)]
*  You've all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation, but CNN [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=45.74s)]
*  is right up there with them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  They pushed the Russian collusion hoax. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=53.02s)]
*  They pushed the Jussie Smollett hoax. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=55.06s)]
*  They smeared Justice Kavanaugh as a rapist, and they also smeared Nick Samman as a white [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=57.74s)]
*  supremacist, and yes, they dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop affair as pure Russian disinformation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  All the mistakes of the mainstream media and CNN in particular seem to magically all go [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=68.42s)]
*  in one direction. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=73.5s)]
*  Are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence, or is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  there something else behind it? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=80.26s)]
*  I think you're describing a different channel than the one that I watch, but I understand [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  that that is a popular right-wing narrative about CNN. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=85.46s)]
*  It's a popular right-wing narrative. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=89.78s)]
*  Never trust anyone who uses the term narrative, by the way, just for the record. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  Christopher Phillips is the man you saw in that clip. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=96.5s)]
*  He's a freshman at the University of Chicago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=98.46s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=100.33999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Phillips, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=101.33999999999999s)]
*  What possessed you to confront these purveyors of disinformation? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=102.86s)]
*  Hi, Tucker. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=107.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=109.1s)]
*  It's an honor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  The way I've always been is to search for truth and ask questions, to sift through the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=112.26s)]
*  lies and find out what's really going on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=117.22s)]
*  So myself and two of my colleagues at the Chicago Thinker, the University of Chicago's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  premier publication, Evita Duffy and Daniel Schmidt, we three went to this conference, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=124.06s)]
*  and we see right when we come in a ton of people, a ton of legacy media employees whose [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=129.62s)]
*  entire careers have been spreading disinformation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  Those are the people who are telling us about how to avoid disinformation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  So I hear Brian Stelter, and he talks for 30 minutes about how Fox News is this huge [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=142.18s)]
*  purveyor of disinformation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=146.88s)]
*  They're the enemy of the people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=147.88s)]
*  And then I come up and I say, wait a second, run that back, because actually CNN, from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=149.18s)]
*  what I've seen at least, is probably 10 times the purveyor of disinformation that you claim [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=153.78s)]
*  Fox News to be. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=159.12s)]
*  And he didn't really have a great answer for it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=160.34s)]
*  Some of the examples that you threw at him are subjective. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  I agreed with your take on it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=168.0s)]
*  But some of them were just objective. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=170.5s)]
*  CNN did dismiss Hunter Biden's laptop as Russian disinformation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=172.1s)]
*  That kid's on camera doing it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=175.92s)]
*  Wouldn't it have been better if he would have said, yeah, I got that wrong. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=177.82s)]
*  I'm sorry about that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=181.58s)]
*  Wouldn't that have worked? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=183.74s)]
*  Gosh, to tell you the truth, I didn't exactly expect him to hand over the keys and say, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=184.74s)]
*  you know what, we're corrupt. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=190.5s)]
*  Go ahead, Chris, and make CNN the truth. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=192.06s)]
*  I did kind of expect him to say, we retracted those stories and we apologize for saying [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=196.18s)]
*  that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=201.22s)]
*  We always try to keep a clean record. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=202.22s)]
*  But there was no apology. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=204.24s)]
*  There was no remorse whatsoever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=205.24s)]
*  It's just, I don't know what news network you're talking about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=206.24s)]
*  That's not mine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=209.28s)]
*  When in reality, he said these things on CNN. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=210.28s)]
*  It's all documented. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=213.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to have credibility if you won't admit that you make a mistake ever. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=214.02s)]
*  Everybody makes mistakes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  We certainly have. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  But just admit it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  What was the reaction from other students at Chicago to your question? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=222.04s)]
*  Well, you know, there's a lot of social pressure to conform to the leftist narrative, to conform [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=225.4s)]
*  to the radical agenda at college campuses. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=231.88s)]
*  So just working for the Chicago thinker really is kind of inviting you to be canceled in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  a sense. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=240.68s)]
*  But a lot of people, I have to say, actually really liked my question. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=241.68s)]
*  They thought it was fair. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  They thought it was honest. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  And it was pure journalism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  I respect everyone who told me that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=248.88s)]
*  Some people were not satisfied with it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=251.4s)]
*  But regardless, I think I did a good thing in asking Brian what gives as to CNN's bias. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=252.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=259.04s)]
*  And just touch reality once a day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=260.04s)]
*  Reassure us that you're not demented. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=263.44s)]
*  But you didn't. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=265.84s)]
*  Chris Phillips from University of Chicago, a credit to your generation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=266.84s)]
*  Thank you for coming on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iZDcvhYZ0&t=270.6s)]
