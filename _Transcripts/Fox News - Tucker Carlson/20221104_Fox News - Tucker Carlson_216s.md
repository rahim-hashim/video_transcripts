# US could run out of diesel fuel very soon, then what? Energy supplier responds
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs)
*  According to the Energy Information Administration, the United States is about to run out of diesel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=0.0s)]
*  fuel or supply of diesel will be exhausted in less than a month. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=6.92s)]
*  What will that mean exactly? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=10.44s)]
*  Well, currently seven states are at, quote, alert level four. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The entire Southeast is at code red. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=16.04s)]
*  That means 72 hour notice is required for all fuel deliveries in anticipation of shortages. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=18.28s)]
*  The diesel shortage is a symptom of a larger problem. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=24.8s)]
*  That would include jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=27.72s)]
*  but their lowest recorded levels in more than a decade. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  So there are a lot of reasons for this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=33.6s)]
*  The Biden's religious war against Russia is the main one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=35.84s)]
*  But the effect on the country, that's the question tonight. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=40.28s)]
*  What will that mean if we run out of these distillates in the middle of winter? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=44.84s)]
*  Mike Taylor is the owner of Combined Energy Services. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=49.64s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Mike, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=53.0s)]
*  So what will that look like exactly? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=54.56s)]
*  Well, Tucker, I'm hearing from our suppliers that it seems like we're walking a fine tightrope on home heating oil and diesel supply. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=60.52s)]
*  I can really only speak to the Northeast. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=67.08s)]
*  They're telling me that in reserves, we're at 60 percent of a five year average. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=69.16s)]
*  All of our heating oil in the Northeast, most of it comes out of the Philadelphia market, Linden, New Jersey. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=74.6s)]
*  Good news is a refinery in Poulsboro, New Jersey is coming back online, produces, I understand, 105 million barrels a day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=80.48s)]
*  So that's going to help the Northeast. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=87.64s)]
*  All of our oil comes out of that region, floats up through the New York harbor, and that supplies New England. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  We've already seen curtailments and shortages up on the Hudson River terminals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=93.76s)]
*  That was early October. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Our suppliers are really saying it's a fine tightrope that if we have a drastically cold winter, could be trouble. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  Could be trouble in supposedly the richest, most developed nation in the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=105.76s)]
*  We're afraid of winter. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=109.12s)]
*  So what would that mean for prices for heating oil and kerosene, by the way, which a lot of poor people use in their trailers? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=111.28s)]
*  What would that look like in February? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=118.12s)]
*  No question already. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=120.72s)]
*  We've seen the last two years home heating oil is up over three dollars and fifty cents a gallon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=121.84s)]
*  Retail home heating oil in the Northeast is over six dollars a gallon today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Kerosene, when we can get it, is at seven. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=129.32s)]
*  As we've spoken in the past, mobile homes use kerosene. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=131.84s)]
*  It's very hard to get right now and it's going to be unaffordable. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  The climate change agenda in the Northeast, Tucker, is really what's causing this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=137.4s)]
*  Of course, across the country, demonization of fossil fuels. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  But in New York State, New Jersey, we're on fast track to try to eliminate fossil fuels with no alternatives that anybody can afford. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=144.28s)]
*  So this means the price of... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=152.72000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=155.08s)]
*  This means the price of cordwood goes up, too. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=155.68s)]
*  It's definitely going to go up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=158.8s)]
*  Cordwood, pellet stoves. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=159.96s)]
*  But in 2030, New York State is outlawing all fossil fuel, meaning natural gas, propane gas, heating oil, all appliances in your home. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=161.68s)]
*  New Jersey is outlawing all large boilers starting in 2025. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=169.12s)]
*  What they're saying is any boiler, one million BTUs are up, which are all your natural gas heating and oil heating systems in New Jersey. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=174.0s)]
*  There's over 8,300 of them have to convert to electricity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=180.72s)]
*  Tucker, New Jersey has already estimated it's going to cost over two million dollars to convert each one of these buildings. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=184.24s)]
*  And they've admitted with an operating cost five to six times using electricity over natural gas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=189.36s)]
*  The crash course we're on the Northeast is just undescribable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=194.56s)]
*  Well, that's just that's that's the definition of insanity. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Mike Taylor, I appreciate you're coming on tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Tucker. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_OLO5tIlCs&t=203.8s)]
