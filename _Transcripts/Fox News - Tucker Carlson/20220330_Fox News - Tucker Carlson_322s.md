# Tucker: This is insulting
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=0.0s)]
*  When the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=2.5s)]
*  the most highly credentialed people in the world [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=5.5s)]
*  seemed stunned by it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=8.4s)]
*  And that was not very reassuring to the rest of us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=9.74s)]
*  Quote, it was a shock to many of the leading experts [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=11.8s)]
*  and policymakers in the United States, Europe, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=14.68s)]
*  and even Ukraine, explained a fellow expert [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=16.88s)]
*  and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=19.88s)]
*  Quote, the head of German intelligence [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=21.68s)]
*  was so caught off guard that he was still in Kiev [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=23.66s)]
*  and had to be evacuated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=25.96s)]
*  That's pretty weird if you think about it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=28.36s)]
*  because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=30.28s)]
*  in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=35.2s)]
*  They seemed ready for it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  And yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  including Biden himself, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=39.9s)]
*  really thought it was going to happen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=41.04s)]
*  And when it did happen, official Washington concluded [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=43.6s)]
*  that Putin must be insane. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=46.16s)]
*  The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=48.7s)]
*  has become more serious, wrote National Review. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=51.32s)]
*  In other words, there's a reason, a good reason, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  and none of us saw this coming. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=56.62s)]
*  Putin just snapped. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=58.28s)]
*  He's irrational and impossible to predict. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=59.48s)]
*  A lot of people took that at face value, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  but you had to notice that like most explanations [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=64.14s)]
*  you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  It was more an excuse than an analysis. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=69.1s)]
*  In fact, Putin may well be crazy, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=72.22s)]
*  but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=73.86s)]
*  of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  And at this point, it would be nice to know [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=78.82s)]
*  exactly what it is, what happened and why. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=80.38s)]
*  Why did the Russians do this? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=83.06s)]
*  It's not treasonous to ask that, it's essential. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=85.58s)]
*  You can't make wise decisions about the future [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=88.76s)]
*  without understanding what just happened. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=91.08s)]
*  It's a prerequisite. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=93.1s)]
*  But our leaders so far have refused to do that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=94.66s)]
*  They keep lying to themselves. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=96.98s)]
*  They're imposing censorship on the rest of us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=98.22s)]
*  They're forcing the entire American population [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=100.56s)]
*  to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=102.58s)]
*  It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=105.68s)]
*  This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=108.7s)]
*  Crisis demands crystal clear thinking. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=112.6s)]
*  So now is the moment to ignore the people [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  who've been consistently wrong, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  and instead listen carefully to the people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  who've gotten it right in the past, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  and said so out loud. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=125.64s)]
*  Those are the people you should be listening to, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=127.52s)]
*  and one of them is Nigel Farage. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Nobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=131.0s)]
*  just the opposite. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  Farage is a nationalist. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  He cares about his own countries devoted his life to it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=136.2s)]
*  In his case, his country is Great Britain, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=139.04s)]
*  whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=140.8s)]
*  by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  The same is true, unfortunately, of our country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  The US has never had a president as reckless as Joe Biden is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=147.78s)]
*  We're gonna pay the price for that for a long time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=150.8s)]
*  But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  could have predicted all of this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=155.0s)]
*  In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=156.72s)]
*  as the leader of the UK Independence Party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=160.0s)]
*  Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=162.84s)]
*  which unfortunately we just saw yesterday. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=165.24s)]
*  In retrospect, his words seem prophetic. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=167.76s)]
*  Farage understood what would happen [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=171.0s)]
*  because he saw clearly what had already taken place. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=173.12s)]
*  Watch this carefully. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=176.2s)]
*  We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth hearing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=180.16s)]
*  Most of the long lists of foreign policy failures [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=184.84s)]
*  and contradictions in the last few years, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=186.84s)]
*  including of course the bombing of Libya, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=191.16s)]
*  has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=193.32s)]
*  This EU empire ever seeking to expand [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=197.8s)]
*  stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=200.52s)]
*  Just to make that worse, of course, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=204.88s)]
*  some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=206.44s)]
*  to join NATO. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=210.32s)]
*  We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=211.66s)]
*  that led to the toppling of the president Yanukovych. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=215.52s)]
*  And that led of course in turn [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=219.74s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin reacting. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=221.64s)]
*  And the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=223.92s)]
*  with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=227.4s)]
*  Now, just to continue with that, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  today we are rushing through an association agreement, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=234.42s)]
*  an undue speed with the Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=238.1s)]
*  And as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=240.4s)]
*  in military exercises in the Ukraine. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=244.16s)]
*  Have we taken leave of our senses? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=246.56s)]
*  Do we actually want to have a war with Putin? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=249.44s)]
*  Because if we do, we're certainly going about it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=252.48s)]
*  the right way. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=255.32s)]
*  Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=256.46s)]
*  the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=260.08s)]
*  that we have seen for over 70 years. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=263.16s)]
*  The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=266.5s)]
*  graphically illustrates the problem. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=270.04s)]
*  And of course we have our own citizens [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=272.2s)]
*  from our own countries engaged in that struggle too. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=273.8s)]
*  In the war against Islamic extremism, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=276.98s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=280.06s)]
*  as a human being, is actually on our side. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=282.26s)]
*  I suggest we grow up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=285.94s)]
*  I suggest we recognize the real threat [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=287.86s)]
*  facing all of our countries, communities, and societies. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=290.42s)]
*  We stop playing war games in the Ukraine [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=293.92s)]
*  and we start to prepare a plan to help countries [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=296.76s)]
*  like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=299.86s)]
*  to try and help them to deal with the real threat [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=304.12s)]
*  that faces us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=306.42s)]
*  Let's not go on provoking Putin, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=307.26s)]
*  whether we like him or not. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0x6BXCi7TM&t=309.5s)]
