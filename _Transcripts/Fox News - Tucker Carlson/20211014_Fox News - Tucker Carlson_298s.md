# Biden presidency is unlike anything we've ever seen: Victor Davis Hanson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k)
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you add this up, and again, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=2.5s)]
*  we just presented a bunch of different specific examples. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=4.22s)]
*  If we had four hours, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=7.22s)]
*  we could probably get more comprehensive, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=8.3s)]
*  but you're seeing the core institutions of American life [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=9.74s)]
*  destroyed by this one mandate, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  which by itself is a challenge, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=14.82s)]
*  an insult really to American liberty. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=17.62s)]
*  But in its effect, it's going to render inoperable [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=19.14s)]
*  our hospitals, our airlines, our police departments, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=22.82s)]
*  our fire departments, our long-term care facilities. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=26.38s)]
*  Fill in the blanks, what else is there? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=29.6s)]
*  That's our society, and none of it's going to work very soon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=31.32s)]
*  What's the point of this, I wonder? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=34.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=37.44s)]
*  It's part of a lot of policies, Tucker, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=38.28s)]
*  and it's not Tucker Carlson that's saying this alone. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=40.0s)]
*  It's Barack Obama that says the border's unsustainable, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=43.04s)]
*  or Larry Summers says the economic agenda won't work, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=46.68s)]
*  or senators on the Democratic side [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  said Afghanistan is a disaster. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=52.14s)]
*  So it's everybody is saying, what's going on? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=54.72s)]
*  We've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=57.66s)]
*  We've read about the Buchanan presidency, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=58.68s)]
*  and some of us lived through the Carter, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=60.94s)]
*  so is it incompetence, accidental? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=62.5s)]
*  Is it non-compos mentis problems with the president? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=65.1s)]
*  Or was this by design an anarchy, a chaos, a nihilism [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=67.7s)]
*  that was sort of never let a crisis go to waste [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=71.66s)]
*  during this tragedy of 2020 to have an agenda [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=74.5s)]
*  that doesn't pull on any of its items 50%, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=78.92s)]
*  but through the sheer fear of this chaotic anarchy, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=82.14s)]
*  anarcho-nistic, we're gonna have a new agenda [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=86.38s)]
*  that's socialist, and nobody knows, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  but they do know one thing, Tucker, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=90.52s)]
*  that the academic world and the abstract world [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  is not just parlor games. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=96.06s)]
*  It matters, that critical race theory that we wrote off [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=97.64s)]
*  as racism is necessary to fight racism. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=101.32s)]
*  Nobody would believe that, we thought, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  or new monetary theory. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=106.56s)]
*  Print money and you get prosperity, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=108.24s)]
*  or critical legal theory that there's no connection [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=110.52s)]
*  between innate natural law and real law. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  We said nobody would believe that, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=116.14s)]
*  and then suddenly they woke up, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  and we see that district attorneys are letting people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=120.14s)]
*  go off scot-free after committing felonies, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=122.94s)]
*  or we've got zero interest at a time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=126.78s)]
*  we've got 6% annual inflation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=128.82s)]
*  So they're thinking this is starting to affect us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=131.5s)]
*  There's nothing in the shelves at Walmart, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=134.06s)]
*  or maybe Target's not gonna have Christmas presents, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=139.38s)]
*  or I don't wanna walk out in New York at night. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=141.86s)]
*  So the academic world has filtered down [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=143.7s)]
*  to the concrete world under this agenda, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=146.6s)]
*  and they're really, really frightened, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  and they're saying we've never seen something [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  like this before, and when they look [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  to these institutions you mentioned, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=154.56s)]
*  they look at the military, or professional sports, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=156.76s)]
*  or entertainment, or Hollywood, or Silicon Valley, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  or social media, or network news, or Wall Street, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  or the corporate boardroom, they say what happened? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  We don't recognize this anymore. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  We've been asleep, and they've filtered [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=168.6s)]
*  into all of these institutions with this agenda [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=171.56s)]
*  that we don't want, and it doesn't work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=174.06s)]
*  And so they're in a panic, and I think just to end, Tucker, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=177.02s)]
*  there's going to be a reckoning, and I think people, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=179.9s)]
*  whether they're Mexican-American communities on the border, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=182.86s)]
*  or where I live, or soccer moms that are mad [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=186.1s)]
*  about what's being taught in the school, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=189.34s)]
*  it's not a top-down woke revolution, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=190.9s)]
*  it's a grassroot, populous revolution. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=193.9s)]
*  We're gonna see it in the next midterms, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=196.22s)]
*  and I think a lot of these institutions [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=198.1s)]
*  are gonna rue the positions that they've taken, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=199.78s)]
*  and the damage they've done. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=202.16s)]
*  Looking back when hospitals told people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=204.16s)]
*  that they couldn't hold the hands of their parents, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=207.4s)]
*  or spouses, or children as they died because of COVID, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=209.56s)]
*  and no one pushed those people out of the way and said, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=213.6s)]
*  "'No, it's my parent, I'm gonna hold her hand as she dies.'" [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=216.32s)]
*  When people put up with that, I wonder if you can come back, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  if you can assert your value as a human being [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=222.48s)]
*  once you've already allowed them to separate you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=227.26s)]
*  from your parents as they die. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=230.04s)]
*  It seems like, I don't know, can we come back from that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  I hope so, I believe that was what was great about America, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=236.32s)]
*  we're building a middle-class citizenry [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  with pragmatic, practical sense, and they're saying, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=240.92s)]
*  if our leaders say, no mask, one mask, two masks, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  herd immunity, 60, 70, 80, 90%, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=247.6s)]
*  no gain-of-function research at the virology lab in Wunaugh, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=250.54s)]
*  then they've lost credibility. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=253.92s)]
*  And when they say there's no such thing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=255.56s)]
*  as really natural acquired immunity, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=257.96s)]
*  you all gotta get vaccinated, even if you've had COVID, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=259.64s)]
*  I think that people are saying, I wanna believe them, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=261.64s)]
*  but I can't believe them anymore, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  and I'm gonna use common sense, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=265.56s)]
*  and it's starting to coalesce, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  and it's really terrifying the left. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=268.68s)]
*  I don't think I've seen them ever more terrified. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=270.64s)]
*  I think that's, and people should insist on common sense. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=273.0s)]
*  Don't let them separate you from your loved ones [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  in their final moment, period. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=277.24s)]
*  Each according to a station, each person, absolutely. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  Each according to a station has to speak out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=284.08s)]
*  Victor Davis-Hansen, I appreciate it, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCVzgg2q0k&t=284.91999999999996s)]
