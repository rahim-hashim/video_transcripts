# Tucker Carlson: The left is attempting to destroy Elon Musk
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's a thought experiment for you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=2.32s)]
*  If you wanted to turn a free country into a dictatorship, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=3.56s)]
*  not that anyone would wanna do that, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=6.8s)]
*  but let's say you did wanna do that, how would you do it? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=8.28s)]
*  What's the first freedom you would curtail? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=11.24s)]
*  Hmm, well, it turns out the founders of this country [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  thought very deeply about that question. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=15.76s)]
*  They were making a new country [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=17.34s)]
*  and they wanted to avoid dictatorship. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=18.52s)]
*  And they concluded that it wasn't even close. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=21.02s)]
*  The freedom that matters is the freedom to speak your mind, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=24.12s)]
*  the freedom of speech. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=26.36s)]
*  That's the most basic and essential of all the freedoms. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=27.72s)]
*  And that's why it's enshrined in the very first amendment [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=31.38s)]
*  to the Bill of Rights. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  It's central not simply to freedom, but to humanity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=36.16s)]
*  It's not opposable thumbs that separate us from the animals. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=38.96s)]
*  It's words. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=42.86s)]
*  We can speak. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=44.56s)]
*  That's our power, words. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=46.34s)]
*  "'In the beginning was the word,' [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  declares John at the opening of the fourth gospel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  "'The word, the word is the most important thing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=53.04s)]
*  that we have.' [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=55.92s)]
*  "'Take away our ability to choose our own words [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=58.32s)]
*  and we are no longer fully human. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=60.14s)]
*  We are subjects. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=62.08s)]
*  We're chattel.' [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=63.48s)]
*  Authoritarians understand this above all. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=65.7s)]
*  That's why they hate freedom of speech. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=69.12s)]
*  In fact, if you gave them a choice, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=71.12s)]
*  they'd let you have a fully automatic 50 caliber machine gun [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=73.24s)]
*  before they allowed you to say exactly what you want. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=76.0s)]
*  With the gun, you might be able to kill people, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=78.96s)]
*  but with words, you can expose them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  With words, you can change the world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=84.8s)]
*  In fact, there has never been a change, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=86.76s)]
*  a deep change to the way people live and think [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=89.68s)]
*  that didn't begin with words. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=92.12s)]
*  Not with might, not with violence, but with words. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=93.72s)]
*  That's why they're so obsessively focused [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=97.36s)]
*  on what you can say, on the words you can use, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=99.48s)]
*  because they understand the power of words. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=102.06s)]
*  And Elon Musk, whatever his faults may be, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  understands this too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=106.64s)]
*  And that's why he's trying to buy Twitter. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  Not because he needs another company, no. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  And Elon Musk purchasing Twitter [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=113.84s)]
*  is more than just a potential change to the media landscape. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=115.64s)]
*  It is a true existential threat [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=119.24s)]
*  to the hegemony of the people currently in charge. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=122.56s)]
*  Allowing freedom of speech means the possibility [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=125.24s)]
*  of a revolution from below against the forces [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=127.4s)]
*  destroying this country and the West. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  So everything rides on this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=132.12s)]
*  They know it, you may not, but they do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=133.72s)]
*  So they've got to do everything they can [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=136.52s)]
*  to destroy Elon Musk, who was just the other day [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=138.74s)]
*  a hero to them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=141.4s)]
*  He's the electric car guy, remember? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=142.64s)]
*  They don't even mention his electric cars anymore, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=144.48s)]
*  because he's doing the one thing you're not allowed to do, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=146.88s)]
*  which is giving voice to people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  So since April, they've been trying to destroy Elon Musk. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=152.0s)]
*  First, they called him a racist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  He's from South Africa, he must be a racist. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=155.76s)]
*  When it turns out he was too rich to care, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=158.1s)]
*  they moved on to new tactics. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=160.52s)]
*  So then NGOs funded by George Soros [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  commanded companies to pull their ad money away from Twitter. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=164.34s)]
*  We'll starve him out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=166.92s)]
*  And then some Saudi Prince tried to argue [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=168.88s)]
*  that Elon Musk was somehow underpaying for Twitter. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=170.4s)]
*  When it's very obvious, look at the markets, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=173.18s)]
*  that he's overpaying. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=174.78s)]
*  And then the Washington Post's Max Boot got involved, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=177.38s)]
*  because this was another war he could support. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=180.06s)]
*  So in order to save democracy, Max Boot informed us, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=182.38s)]
*  we need more content moderation on Twitter. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=185.06s)]
*  No free speech allowed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=188.66s)]
*  Of course, content moderation is a euphemism for censorship. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  And who does censorship help? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=193.74s)]
*  Always and everywhere the powerful. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=195.24s)]
*  Who does it hurt? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=196.72s)]
*  The weak. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=197.56s)]
*  Words are all they have. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=198.38s)]
*  So if you look at the social media, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=199.68s)]
*  you can see that they have no power at all. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=201.36s)]
*  They have no power at all. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  They have no power at all. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=206.52s)]
*  These people take their ability to say what they think [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=208.46s)]
*  away from them, and they have no power at all. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=213.46s)]
*  So tonight, after roughly six months [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  of watching this drama, which has gone in and out [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=218.96s)]
*  of the news cycle, it looks like they have failed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  to stop Elon Musk from buying Twitter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=223.12s)]
*  All indications that we have as of right now [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=226.0s)]
*  90% probability that within the next two weeks, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=228.44s)]
*  Elon Musk will own Twitter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  And he has said repeatedly, and we can't guess the future, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=232.4s)]
*  but he has said he is doing this in order [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=235.0s)]
*  to give voice to people who have no voice. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=237.84s)]
*  All of us have forgotten that Twitter banned [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=240.76s)]
*  a sitting president of the United States from speaking, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=242.92s)]
*  thereby making it really clear who's got the real power. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=246.04s)]
*  No, not the US government. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=248.28s)]
*  Transnational corporations like Twitter, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  which control speech. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=252.0s)]
*  So they did everything they could [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  to stop this from happening, but they failed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=255.12s)]
*  So now they're attempting to destroy Elon Musk the man. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=258.24s)]
*  And again, to be clear, we don't know Elon Musk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  We're not carrying water for Elon Musk. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=262.68s)]
*  He may have weird agendas we don't know about, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=264.2s)]
*  but it's only about speech. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=267.76s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=269.34s)]
*  And that's why the Justice Department [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=270.18s)]
*  is now investigating Elon Musk [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=271.28s)]
*  for reasons that no one can explain. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=272.84s)]
*  But that's what the DOJ does now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=274.36s)]
*  Tries to terrify people with criminal investigations [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=275.96s)]
*  into obeying. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  Then David Frum naturally got involved [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=280.28s)]
*  because there's no level to which he will not stoop [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=282.4s)]
*  in defense of the people in charge. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=285.28s)]
*  He is now calling for the Biden administration [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  to seize Elon Musk's satellites. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=289.16s)]
*  The ones that he's given for free [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=293.04s)]
*  to the government of Ukraine [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=295.0s)]
*  for use in their war effort against Russia. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=296.08s)]
*  The US should have a plan ready [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=298.56s)]

*  We gotta get out of here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=443.5s)]
*  But it's interesting, unlike previous regimes, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  these are not people in uniforms. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=447.78000000000003s)]

*  as efficiently as they can, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=599.78s)]

*  They've unshackled themselves. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=642.4200000000001s)]
*  They've taken off the leash. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=644.26s)]
*  JD Vance is one of them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=645.38s)]
*  He's running for Senate in Ohio. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=646.34s)]
*  He's running against a guy called Tim Ryan. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=647.86s)]
*  So Tim Ryan is worried he's gonna lose. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=650.5400000000001s)]
*  In fact, he is gonna lose. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=652.58s)]
*  We're gonna celebrate when he does. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=653.7s)]
*  But Tim Ryan decided, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=655.4200000000001s)]
*  well, I gotta stop JD Vance. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=656.26s)]
*  I don't wanna argue with him on any of the issues [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=657.38s)]
*  because I actually don't have a better argument. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=659.02s)]
*  So you know what I'm gonna do? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=660.46s)]
*  I'm gonna call him a racist. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=661.3s)]
*  That'll stop him. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=663.34s)]
*  You're a racist. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=664.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=665.02s)]
*  Watch how JD Vance responded last night [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=666.46s)]
*  from the Ohio Senate debate. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=668.5799999999999s)]
*  This great replacement theory was the motivator [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=670.9s)]
*  for the shooting in Buffalo. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  Where that shooter had all these great [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  replacement theory writings that JD Vance agrees with. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=678.8199999999999s)]
*  Some sicko got this information that he's peddling with, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=682.06s)]
*  again, those extremists that he runs around with, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=686.62s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ted Cruz, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=689.86s)]
*  all these guys, they just wanna stoke this racial violence. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=692.86s)]
*  We're tired of it, JD. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=696.1s)]
*  This is disgusting. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=697.86s)]
*  I'd like to get one more. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=698.78s)]

*  and people like Tim Ryan accuse me of engaging [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=701.78s)]

*  I'll tell you exactly what happens, Tim. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=707.78s)]
*  What happens is that my own children, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=708.98s)]
*  my biracial children, get attacked by scumbags online [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  and in person because you are so desperate [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3uDjyXPzWs&t=715.58s)]
