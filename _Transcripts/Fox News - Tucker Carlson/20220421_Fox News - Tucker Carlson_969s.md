# Tucker: Something really dark is going on
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's side. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's an interesting story. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=4.2s)]
*  If the New Yorker were still a real magazine, they might write it up, but of course they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=5.2s)]
*  won't. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=8.16s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=9.16s)]
*  Last summer, deep in the bowels of the transportation department in Washington, some nameless federal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=10.16s)]
*  analysts came across a highly puzzling trend in a pile of stats on traffic deaths. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=14.64s)]
*  It turned out that in the year 2020, the number of American motorists who died on the road [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=21.5s)]
*  spiked dramatically. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=26.18s)]
*  Traffic deaths rose by more than 10% in a single year. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=28.32s)]
*  Now in any year, that would be odd and distressing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=30.96s)]
*  But coming as it did in 2020, it was flat out bizarre because as you'll remember, in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=34.5s)]
*  2020 there was a pandemic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=38.0s)]
*  It had just started. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=39.0s)]
*  Millions of people stayed home that year. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=41.08s)]
*  They did not drive to work. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=42.6s)]
*  Many didn't drive at all. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=44.2s)]
*  In 2020, roads were less crowded than they had been in decades in this country, so of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=45.96s)]
*  course you would expect far fewer traffic deaths. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=50.2s)]
*  Less traffic, fewer people dying in traffic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=53.18s)]
*  And yet there were more traffic deaths. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=55.6s)]
*  Think that's weird? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=58.04s)]
*  It gets weirder. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=59.04s)]
*  If you look deeper into the numbers, you saw that not only were more Americans dying in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=60.04s)]
*  cars in the year 2020, a staggering number of those who died were black. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=64.52s)]
*  Traffic deaths among African Americans rose by nearly 25% in a single year. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=70.32s)]
*  That's unprecedented. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  So in a normal presidential administration, that question, why is this happening, would [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=78.64s)]
*  be the subject of urgent academic study. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=82.36s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=84.52s)]
*  Let's figure out why. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=85.52s)]
*  In this administration, it was not the subject of urgent academic study. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=86.52s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Because Pete Buttigieg is now the Secretary of Transportation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Buttigieg once worked at McKinsey, so he already knew the cause of these deaths, and it was, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=93.28s)]
*  needless to say, racism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=98.52s)]
*  Racism did it because America's roads are racist. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=100.84s)]
*  They're killing black people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=103.24s)]
*  As the Washington Post put it, the Transportation Department, quote, concluded that black communities [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  tend to be crisscrossed by more dangerous roads, end quote. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=109.42s)]
*  Now that made sense to the Washington Post, and you can see why. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=114.16s)]
*  Civil engineers, road builders, bent on genocide, would, needless to say, put all the dangerous [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=117.36s)]
*  roads in black neighborhoods. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=122.28s)]
*  That's who they are. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=124.36s)]
*  And that kind of thing happens all the time in America. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=125.36s)]
*  This is a racist country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=127.52s)]
*  Joe Biden has told us that countless times. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=129.04s)]
*  But what doesn't make sense is the timing here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=131.68s)]
*  Very few of these racist roads are new. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=135.76s)]
*  Most of them had been there a long time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  So why did so many black motorists suddenly start dying in the year 2020? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=141.02s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg had no idea. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  He didn't even bother to guess because honestly, he didn't really care. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=147.46s)]
*  But we do care. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=152.28s)]
*  We've got a theory, and here it is. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=153.28s)]
*  If you look at the numbers, you will notice that traffic deaths among African Americans [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=154.86s)]
*  in the year 2020 surged in the month of June. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=158.52s)]
*  Fatalities among black drivers in June 2020 were fully 55% higher than they were in June [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=161.74s)]
*  of 2019. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  You never see increases like that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=169.06s)]
*  What could have happened? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=171.3s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=172.3s)]
*  It was in the last week of May of 2020 that a convicted felon called George Floyd died [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=174.62s)]
*  in police custody in Minneapolis. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=179.62s)]
*  And after that, you'll recall everything changed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=181.54s)]
*  What changed most of all was how we regard the rule of law. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=184.22s)]
*  As Russ Martin of the Governor's Highway Safety Association put it, Floyd's death, quote, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=188.06s)]
*  accelerated national discussion about equity in transportation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=193.06s)]
*  And that discussion would include, quote, questions about enforcement. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=197.26s)]
*  Oh, there it is right there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=200.38s)]
*  That's the answer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=202.26s)]
*  Cops across the country were told to stop enforcing traffic laws against black drivers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=203.66s)]
*  No one wanted to be accused of arresting somebody for the crime of, quote, driving while black. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=208.6s)]
*  So in the name of equity, the law no longer applied to huge numbers of people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=213.28s)]
*  Result? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=218.9s)]
*  Thousands of Americans died. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=220.18s)]
*  This is a trend, you may have noticed, and it doesn't just apply to traffic and it doesn't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=222.94s)]
*  just cause traffic deaths. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=227.26s)]
*  Here's a chart that shows the number of black Americans murdered every year from 2010 to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=229.62s)]
*  2020. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=234.78s)]
*  Look carefully and you notice two major spikes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=236.66s)]
*  One spike came in 2014. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=239.06s)]
*  That was exactly the moment the media decided to lie to us about the death of Michael Brown [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=240.06s)]
*  in Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=244.0s)]
*  Activists then used that false story to drive police out of black neighborhoods in many [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=246.3s)]
*  parts of America. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=250.56s)]
*  That was supposed to make things better. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=252.02s)]
*  Fewer cops, less racism, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=253.58s)]
*  No. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=255.58s)]
*  Net effect? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=256.58s)]
*  A lot of people got killed and most of them were black. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=257.58s)]
*  Then there's the second spike in the last decade, the biggest one yet. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=260.94s)]
*  As we said, it came in the summer of 2020 and it's continuing today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=264.06s)]
*  Same reason, same effect. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  There aren't a lot of trends in social science that can be explained in a single graph, but [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=273.02s)]
*  this is one of them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=276.54s)]
*  Less law enforcement means more crime and over time it means more dead children, more [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=278.08s)]
*  grieving parents. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=283.44s)]
*  You don't need to be a criminologist to understand this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=285.12s)]
*  It's very obvious. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=287.52s)]
*  Even Lori Lightfoot gets it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=288.8s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot is the mayor of Chicago. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=290.64s)]
*  Thanks to her equity-based policies, the city of Chicago is falling apart. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=292.96s)]
*  People are dying in huge numbers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=296.44s)]
*  Shootings in Chicago jumped 60% last year. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=298.32s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot knows perfectly well this is happening. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=301.52s)]
*  She knows why it is happening, but Lori Lightfoot doesn't care. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot is so uninterested in all of those deaths, mostly of black people, that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=307.8s)]
*  she won't even answer questions about them when asked. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Watch this exchange. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=315.84s)]
*  It comes from Tuesday of this week. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=316.84s)]
*  Every time you have a press conference you say crime is down. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=319.48s)]
*  The economy is booming. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=322.92s)]
*  Well, that's not true, but get your questions, sir. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=323.92s)]
*  Across the street we had a police officer on duty, the victim of a hit and run. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  We have Michigan Avenue, the magnificent miles now referred to as the Mile of Fear. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=332.98s)]
*  The Water Tower Place has thrown the keys back to the lender. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=338.9s)]
*  They say they don't want to be in Chicago anymore. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=343.5s)]
*  Real Chicagoans are asking me, how could you possibly even consider running for re-election [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=346.98s)]
*  as mayor of the city of Chicago after all the harm you've caused? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=353.94s)]
*  Well, I disagree with you fundamentally, and I don't think I need to address and dignify [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=357.62s)]
*  your comments one second further. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=363.66s)]
*  Next question. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  Next question. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  So Lori Lightfoot won't answer the question precisely because she knows the answer. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=370.82s)]
*  In the name of equity, officials in Chicago have stopped enforcing the law. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=375.6s)]

*  Here's just one example. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=392.74s)]
*  It comes from Fox's Chicago station. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=393.74s)]
*  The details on the offender's prior history does call into question how he was released. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=396.14s)]
*  This document from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office says in June of 2021, 16-year-old [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=401.32s)]

*  Five days later, he was released on electronic monitoring. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  Fourteen days later, the bracelet came off and he was put on a curfew. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=418.06s)]
*  Six months later, they say he was involved in a carjacking. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=421.98s)]
*  This time, police recovered a loaded Glock 9-millimeter handgun with a round in the chamber. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=425.32s)]
*  That's when he was put back on monitoring. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=431.12s)]
*  In the case of Tuesday's shooting, the 16-year-old is charged with first-degree murder and carjacking. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=433.76s)]
*  He carjacked a Lyft driver earlier in the day and took off in that same infinity after [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=439.3s)]
*  the alleged shooting of a teen he didn't even know. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=444.1s)]
*  Stories like this constantly in the city of Chicago, cities across the country, they're [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  always the same, but the details of this one tell you everything. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=452.54s)]
*  A criminal runs from the police carrying an illegal gun. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=456.3s)]
*  Then the same politicians who never stop lecturing you about gun control, it's immoral to defend [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=459.1s)]
*  yourself, they scream at you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=463.5s)]
*  Those same people let this guy who used a gun to commit a crime out of jail immediately [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=465.22s)]
*  because equity. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=469.54s)]
*  Then he gets rid of his ankle monitor and commits a carjacking. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=471.62s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=474.82s)]
*  Well, Lori Lightfoot's friends release him once again because incarceration bad. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=475.82s)]
*  So what does he do? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=480.74s)]
*  He drives off to shoot and kill a 15-year-old. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=481.82s)]
*  Because why wouldn't he? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=484.86s)]
*  There's no penalty. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=486.26s)]
*  Now, if tragedies like this happened occasionally, you would call them accidents. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=487.26s)]
*  You would feel sad, but you wouldn't be bothered. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=491.78000000000003s)]
*  These are not accidents. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=494.3s)]
*  This is happening every day in the city of Chicago. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=495.64s)]
*  Only 43% of all criminals convicted in the state of Illinois commit new crimes within [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=499.42s)]
*  three years of being released, and some are released very early. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=503.54s)]
*  That's a high number compared to other states. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=506.78000000000003s)]
*  In saner places like Texas, South Carolina, West Virginia, the recidivism rate after three [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=509.54s)]
*  years is about half of that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=514.5s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=516.74s)]
*  Politics. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=517.74s)]
*  Honestly, that's not a partisan talking point. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=518.74s)]
*  It's true. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  For the last decade, for example, the most liberal state in the country, California, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=521.24s)]
*  has recorded a recidivism rate of nearly 50%. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=526.1s)]
*  Now, keep in mind the irony here. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=529.1s)]
*  They tell you that we shouldn't incarcerate people because incarceration doesn't work. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=531.94s)]
*  And if you really want to rehabilitate people, you have to let them out. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=535.86s)]
*  But they're not rehabilitated. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=540.86s)]
*  That's why they're reoffending at almost 50% in the state of California. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=541.94s)]
*  So incarceration has two purposes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=545.78s)]
*  One is to improve the prisoner so he won't reoffend. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=548.22s)]
*  But the main purpose is to protect the rest of us who aren't committing crimes, who've [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  got kids who just want to live a normal life. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=555.78s)]
*  They've forgotten that part. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=557.78s)]
*  So every day in California, politicians release truly dangerous criminals back into the public [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  sphere. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=564.62s)]
*  And this is why you're now taking a very big risk if you dare to use public transportation [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=565.62s)]
*  in the city of Los Angeles. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=568.9s)]
*  You could be shot or sexually assaulted. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=569.98s)]
*  And we're not guessing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=571.5s)]
*  We have the tape. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=572.5s)]
*  Here's surveillance footage from LA's transit system. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=573.86s)]
*  It's on your screen right now. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=575.98s)]
*  It includes pictures of a woman being raped in public as she's sitting down. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=576.98s)]
*  We're cutting some of it out. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=580.54s)]
*  That happened in public. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=581.86s)]
*  And it happens a lot, that kind of thing. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=583.26s)]
*  So we went to LA for the premiere of season two of our documentary series. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  We went there because we wanted to understand how one man, a man called George Gascon, a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  prosecutor backed by George Soros, could have done so much in such little time to destroy [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=593.46s)]
*  the city. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  And of course he did in the name of equity. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  We talked to the family of a murder victim called Fatima Johnson. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=600.86s)]
*  It was a bracing conversation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=603.5400000000001s)]
*  Fatima Johnson, a mother of six, was found brutally murdered in her apartment. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=605.74s)]
*  She was violently murdered, beaten to death, hog-tied and gagged. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=612.9s)]
*  The suspect is a career criminal called Darryl Collins. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=620.18s)]
*  Collins served decades in prison for two murders as well as a string of armed robberies. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=623.42s)]
*  He had quite an extensive criminal history. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  A series of armed robberies. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=630.26s)]
*  He killed two different people on two separate occasions. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=632.62s)]
*  He was under 25 when he committed those murders. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=635.42s)]
*  He was eligible for youthful parole. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=638.46s)]
*  And the parole board decided, oh, it looks like you've rehabilitated yourself and we'll [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=641.1800000000001s)]
*  go ahead and release you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=646.4200000000001s)]
*  That was a huge mistake. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  He came in and told my mom he was going to marry her and, you know, he would be our stepdad. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=648.4200000000001s)]
*  Prince Charming Bush. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=658.1800000000001s)]
*  Despite previous convictions for murder and despite the fact that Fatima Johnson was bound [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=660.1s)]
*  and horrifyingly tortured before she was killed, George Gascon is refusing to add any enhancements [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=665.38s)]
*  to this case. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=671.38s)]
*  George Gascon is not the only corrupt prosecutor who's doing this. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=676.38s)]
*  George Soros has paid for people just like George Gascon in many American cities. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=679.1s)]
*  Kim Foxx in Chicago, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, Alvin Bragg now in Manhattan, others. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=682.8199999999999s)]
*  In every case, many Americans, thousands overall, have died as a result. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=688.38s)]
*  So who's benefiting from this slaughter and how exactly are they benefiting? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=694.3000000000001s)]
*  That's a fair question. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=698.5400000000001s)]
*  You've got to wonder. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=699.5400000000001s)]
*  We do know for certain that voters don't want it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=700.5400000000001s)]
*  Americans want the laws they voted for to be enforced. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=702.7s)]
*  And that is true of black voters just like any others because why wouldn't it be? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, white liberals, black people don't love crime, actually. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=709.38s)]
*  You're not helping black people by increasing the amount of crime in their neighborhoods. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=711.4200000000001s)]
*  And a new Pew poll proves this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=715.1800000000001s)]
*  The poll asked black adults what they cared about most. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=720.02s)]
*  It wasn't racism and diversity or equity. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=721.02s)]
*  That was near the bottom of the list. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=723.5799999999999s)]
*  What they cared about most was, quote, violence and crime. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=724.5799999999999s)]
*  That's what they cared about. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't they care about it? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=727.98s)]
*  So as people to judge frets about racist roads, thousands of black people are dying of gunshot wounds. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=730.06s)]
*  Now, when people are sick of this, in San Francisco, the lunatic equity-mongering DA [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=736.5799999999999s)]

*  Boudin has, among other things, encouraged open-air narcotics markets throughout the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=744.9s)]
*  city of San Francisco. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=748.54s)]
*  And as a result, you guessed it, more than twice as many people have died from drug ODs [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=750.34s)]
*  in San Francisco than from COVID. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=753.98s)]
*  Who could support something like that? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=756.94s)]
*  You'd have to be pretty out of touch. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=758.46s)]
*  Well, singer John Legend does. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=759.7s)]
*  Quote, I endorsed Chesa for DA when he ran for election. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=761.3s)]
*  Legend tweeted, and I support him now. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=764.5s)]
*  Of course you do, John Legend. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=766.22s)]
*  The Biden administration supports him, too. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=768.1s)]
*  Just days ago, police in Washington raided an apartment where they found a dog called Pablo. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=770.34s)]
*  The dog had been stolen at gunpoint by thieves who also took drugs and money. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=774.94s)]
*  So police arrested four men, three juveniles, in the apartment. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=779.7399999999999s)]
*  A few hours later, Joe Biden's Justice Department announced he was refusing to charge any of them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=783.54s)]
*  The U.S. Attorney's Office has decided not to move forward with what they were charged [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=789.18s)]

*  I can tell you the seven people arrested yesterday were charged with receiving stolen property. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=799.66s)]
*  So receiving Pablo in this case. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=804.74s)]
*  Pablo was one of two dogs stolen during a Wednesday violent crime spree that police say lasted nearly an hour. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=806.7s)]
*  There were four incidents reported within that time frame, including a double shooting in Northeast D.C., [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=812.94s)]
*  along with the armed robberies of two dog owners. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=818.46s)]
*  Police tell us that when they recovered Pablo in a Northeast D.C. apartment, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=821.74s)]
*  that they also apprehended some items here, including drugs, a pistol, an AR-15-style rifle and ammunition. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=826.1400000000001s)]
*  So what happens when you allow people to commit violence? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=835.46s)]
*  The one thing the state can never do. The state is a monopoly on violence. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=839.7800000000001s)]
*  In a democracy, we decide when violence is appropriate. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=843.0600000000001s)]
*  But what happens when you allow antisocial elements to commit all the violence they want? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  You get a lot of violence and your cities start to resemble third world hellholes. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=849.9000000000001s)]
*  People are executed in broad daylight and no one bothers to call the cops. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  That just happened in Atlanta. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=857.5400000000001s)]
*  Fifty-one-year-old security guard Anthony Frazier getting out of his vehicle on Monday near Cleveland Avenue in southwest Atlanta. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=860.78s)]
*  Little does Frazier know he's about to be murdered. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=867.78s)]
*  Now watch as the suspected gunman walks toward him with a pistol in his right hand. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=871.38s)]
*  Another man sitting there in the curb will watch the whole thing happen. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=876.78s)]
*  Police don't show the actual shooting. Just the aftermath. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=880.9799999999999s)]
*  Frazier laying there on the ground dead. His bloodied body has been blurred. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=884.9799999999999s)]
*  The alleged gunman goes through his belongings before casually walking away from the scene. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=890.78s)]
*  Remarkably, the witness who was sitting at the corner gets up and walks by Frazier's lifeless body, just shaking his head in apparent disbelief. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=894.78s)]
*  Then two other men approach the victim and also appear to search him. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=903.78s)]
*  Take a closer look. We've zoomed in on the video as they then walk away with what appears to be the deceased victim's wallet. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=908.78s)]
*  There's something really wrong with everyone in that video except the dead man. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=917.5799999999999s)]
*  There's something really wrong with the rest of us for putting up with this and not figuring out why exactly it's happening. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  It's a little more complicated than racism and mass incarceration. Something really dark is going on. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=926.5799999999999s)]
*  But we can say that these sorts of things happen a lot more than they otherwise would when you decide that law should be applied on the basis of skin color. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=931.5799999999999s)]
*  When you decide that, a lot of people die. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=940.5799999999999s)]
*  They bleed out in gutters on city streets as the rest of the neighborhood hides in doors of terror. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=943.38s)]
*  And as it happens, most of the dead come from the very group our leaders say they're protecting. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=947.38s)]
*  We love you so much, we're letting you die. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=952.38s)]
*  That's the equity agenda. Too bad BLM never told us how it was going to end. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGb748VOcYU&t=954.38s)]
