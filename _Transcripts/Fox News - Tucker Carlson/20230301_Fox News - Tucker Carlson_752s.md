# Tucker: The system worked
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, one thing we have learned after many years in the news business is that every once [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=3.92s)]
*  in a while you've got to eat some crow and admit that despite your best intentions, you [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=8.6s)]
*  were completely wrong about something. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=13.08s)]
*  Tonight is one of those times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=15.52s)]
*  For nearly four years now, we've been under the impression, an impression we regularly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=17.66s)]
*  communicated to you, our viewers, that actor Jussie Smollett was the greatest BS artist [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=21.12s)]
*  Bill Clinton, that he was a transparent race hoaxer who fooled the dummies in the national [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=26.5s)]
*  media but could not fool us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=32.74s)]
*  That's what we thought. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=34.7s)]
*  We thought Jussie Smollett was a liar. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=35.78s)]
*  You remember his story. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=37.72s)]
*  It did seem unlikely. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=38.72s)]
*  Late one night in sub-zero temperatures in a snowstorm, Jussie Smollett decided to venture [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=41.22s)]
*  out for a sandwich in downtown Chicago when he was, as people are, accosted by two physically [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  enormous Trump supporters from Africa who somehow recognized him despite his ski hat [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=51.74s)]
*  from his part in a little-known musical drama series called Empire because campy musical [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=56.86s)]
*  dramas are apparently huge with musclehead Trump voters from Nigeria. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=62.1s)]
*  So they knew him instantly, right away. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=66.06s)]
*  These two crazed African right-wing maniacs also correctly guessed that Jussie Smollett [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  had voted for Hillary Clinton and they hated that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=73.68s)]
*  And so, as Trump voters so often do, they began pummeling him about the face and screaming, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=76.9s)]
*  This is maggot country! [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=81.3s)]
*  Because that's one of the things people typically say about downtown Chicago. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  It's maggot country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=85.86s)]
*  Then, because they were still angry, they're always angry, these Nigerian racists poured [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=87.06s)]
*  bleach on Jussie Smollett, threw a noose around his neck, and then ran off into the night [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=91.34s)]
*  howling with demented glee. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=96.94s)]
*  Here's how Jussie Smollett described it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=99.94s)]
*  And I see the attacker masked and he said, This maggot country punches me right in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=102.54s)]
*  face. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=114.34s)]
*  I was just jumped. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=115.34s)]
*  And then I look down and I see that there's a rope around my neck. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=116.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  We're going to be honest with you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  We had some questions about that story. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  It just didn't sound right to us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=124.62s)]
*  Something was off. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=127.62s)]
*  Is this Nigerian Trump voters assaulting liberals in downtown Chicago? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=129.5s)]
*  How common is this? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=133.82s)]
*  Chicago has 50 aldermen and not a single one of them is a Republican. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=136.38s)]
*  Chicago has not had a Republican mayor in 80 years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=140.58s)]
*  Donald Trump got 12% of the vote in Chicago. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=143.1s)]
*  It didn't really seem like maggot country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=146.58s)]
*  But boy were we wrong. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=149.98s)]
*  Not only is Chicago a right-wing Donald Trump stronghold, last night the QAnon army came [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=151.38s)]
*  for Lori Lightfoot. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=157.3s)]
*  Lightfoot of course is the mayor of Chicago and a consummate neoliberal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=159.3s)]
*  She's the one who prevented Chicago cops from chasing criminals on foot because chasing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  criminals is racist. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=167.66000000000003s)]
*  She's the mayor who plunged Chicago even further into debt for a good cause to pay for the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=169.46s)]
*  Department of Climate and Environmental Equity. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=174.3s)]
*  And in fact, Lightfoot's commitment to equity was so profound that she banned white reporters [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=178.46s)]
*  from talking to her. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  She took down not one, but two statues of Christopher Columbus who was a racist. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=184.18s)]
*  So you would think if anybody would be safe in Chicago, which is roughly 100% Democratic [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=190.02s)]
*  Party voters, it would be Lori Lightfoot. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=195.58s)]
*  Oh, but no. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=197.34s)]
*  According to Lori Lightfoot, the extreme MAGA Republicans, the ones who tried to bleach [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=199.3s)]
*  Jussie Smollett, activated their sleeper cells around the city and they showed up at the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=204.02s)]
*  polls en masse, which means lots of them at once. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=209.5s)]
*  And the effect was to make Lori Lightfoot the first Chicago mayor in 40 years to lose [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=214.1s)]
*  re-election. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=218.22s)]
*  As Lightfoot put it last night at her non-victory party, these MAGA Republicans hated her not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=219.5s)]
*  because of what she did, but because of who she is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=225.26s)]
*  Asked directly whether her defeat in the Democratic primary had been unfair, Lightfoot answered [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=228.5s)]
*  this way, quote, I'm a black woman in America. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=231.78s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=234.7s)]
*  Now, one of the many tragedies here, and there are so many layers of tragedy, is that Lori [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=235.7s)]
*  Lightfoot, insightful as she's always been, saw this racist insurgency coming for years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=241.58s)]
*  Here she was in 2021. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  Mayor in recent months, there have been questions raised about your temperament and your reaction [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=250.86s)]
*  to criticism. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=256.02000000000004s)]
*  Tribune editorial used the term irascible. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=257.02000000000004s)]
*  How much of this do you think might have to do with the fact that you're a woman and specifically [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  a black woman? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  About 99% of it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  Because the thing is, there are no women in Chicago. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=271.26s)]
*  It's an entirely male and right-wing city. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=274.26s)]
*  And so all opposition to Lori Lightfoot derived from her race and gender. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=277.7s)]
*  It's not that people were angry about violent crime in Chicago. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=282.5s)]
*  That never crossed her mind. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=286.3s)]
*  No. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=287.82s)]
*  Here instead is her explanation from last night's concession speech. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=288.82s)]
*  Obviously, we didn't win the election today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  But I stand here with my head held high and a heart full of gratitude. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=296.02s)]
*  I'm grateful that we worked together to remove a record number of guns off our streets, reduced [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=301.58s)]
*  homicides and started making real progress on public safety. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, you didn't win. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=312.34s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=314.82s)]
*  You got spanked like the bad little mayor you were. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=315.82s)]
*  But, according to the Chicago Police Department, we're also happy she was mayor because she [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=318.82s)]
*  made the city a lot better. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=324.78s)]
*  Here's what the police said in a statement. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=325.98s)]
*  Quote, over the past three years, robberies, burglaries and thefts hit record lows in Chicago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=327.38s)]
*  Each of these crime categories saw decreases not seen for the last 50 years. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=332.94s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot safer than it's ever been in 50 years. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=339.02s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=342.86s)]
*  Let's check the same police department's own statistics. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=344.54s)]
*  And here they are. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=347.42s)]
*  From 2019 to 2023 in Chicago, robberies went up, not down, actually up 27%. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=348.42s)]
*  Theft, nearly 40%. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=354.74s)]
*  Murder, kind of a significant category, 59%. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=357.18s)]
*  How about motor vehicle theft? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=361.22s)]
*  Is that up or down? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's up 270%. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  So if you average all that out, that means all crime is up 33%. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=367.54s)]
*  There were 300 more murders by gunshot in 2021 than there were in 2019. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=372.3s)]
*  There were 2,000 more shooting victims. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  There were 30% more overall shootings. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  So that's not a safer city, actually. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=383.66s)]
*  That's a much more dangerous city that people are fleeing for their very lives. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=386.18s)]
*  What's interesting is that the people in charge of making the place safer are still working [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  to make it much more dangerous. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=396.06s)]
*  The top prosecutor in the city, Lori Lightfoot's ally, Kim Fox, is rejecting thousands of felony [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=398.66s)]
*  cases every year, just not prosecuting crimes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  In 2022, for example, Chicago prosecutors had a total of 20,000 felony cases come in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=407.1s)]
*  and out of those, they rejected right out of hand 2,000. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=413.02s)]
*  They pursued, out of 20,000 cases, just 1,900 to indictment. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=416.82s)]
*  Not to conviction, just to indictment, charging people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=422.7s)]
*  And those numbers are not an anomaly. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=426.46s)]
*  They're similar for every other year of Lori Lightfoot's historically disastrous tenure [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=428.3s)]
*  as mayor. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=433.94s)]
*  And what's happening? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=434.94s)]
*  Well, people are fleeing Chicago, as noted because they don't want to get killed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=435.94s)]
*  And you can see that in the home prices. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=440.14000000000004s)]
*  Where are home prices highest in America? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=442.18s)]
*  Of the 12 highest priced home markets in America, nine are in Florida because people are fleeing there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=444.42s)]
*  The opposite is true of Chicago. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  The median home price is less than the median home price in the country as a whole, in fashionable [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=452.86s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=458.42s)]
*  The median home price in Chicago is $270,000. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=459.42s)]
*  So who did this? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=463.98s)]
*  Well, it was a group effort, but Lori Lightfoot was the mayor. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=464.98s)]
*  But it's not her fault. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=469.74s)]
*  You know whose fault it is? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=470.74s)]
*  Businesses and residents, pedestrians, they made themselves easy targets. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=472.38s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=477.14s)]
*  I'm disappointed that they're not doing more to take safety and make it a priority. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=478.14s)]
*  For example, we still have retailers that won't institute plans like having security [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=483.66s)]
*  officers in your stores, making sure that they've got cameras that are actually operational, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=488.62s)]
*  locking up their merchandise at night, chaining high end bags. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=494.82s)]
*  These purses seem to be something that is attracting a lot of attention on these organized [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=499.38s)]
*  retail theft units. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=504.7s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=506.62s)]
*  Did she just blame the stores for getting robbed? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=509.5s)]
*  How is that different from saying, well, you're wearing a halter top. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=512.96s)]
*  Of course you got raped. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=515.14s)]
*  I mean, it's not different actually. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=516.14s)]
*  It's blaming the victim. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=518.14s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=519.58s)]
*  What was last time you saw the mayor of a city blame crime victims for being victimized? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=520.58s)]
*  Well, you just saw Lori Lightfoot do it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=525.38s)]
*  So crime is no longer punished by and large in Chicago, unless you disrespect Lori Lightfoot's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=528.66s)]
*  authority. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=534.98s)]
*  And in that case, you went straight to jail. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=535.98s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=539.4599999999999s)]
*  Now, I've directed Superintendent Brown to order all police districts to give special [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=540.4599999999999s)]
*  attention to these parties. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=545.86s)]
*  And this is how it's going to be. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=548.5799999999999s)]
*  We will shut you down. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=550.38s)]
*  We will cite you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=552.16s)]
*  And if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=553.6s)]
*  Period. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=558.68s)]
*  We will take you to jail. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=559.68s)]
*  We'll arrest you and take you to jail. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  Not if you shoot somebody. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=564.16s)]
*  If you break Lori Lightfoot's COVID law. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=566.04s)]
*  But of course, COVID law didn't apply to her because why would dictators follow their own [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  edicts? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=573.8s)]
*  And so Lori Lightfoot immediately broke the state's stay at home order to get a haircut. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=575.16s)]
*  Even when she was busted getting her haircut, not a very good haircut, we'll have to say, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=580.0400000000001s)]
*  she blamed, of course, everybody else. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=585.22s)]
*  I'm the public face of this city. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=589.48s)]
*  I'm on national media and I'm out in the public eye. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=591.7s)]
*  And you know, I'm a person who I take my personal hygiene very seriously. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=596.2s)]
*  As I said, I felt like I needed to have a haircut. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=601.86s)]
*  I'm not able to do that myself. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=605.6s)]
*  And so I got a haircut. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  So now Lori Lightfoot is gone. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=610.96s)]
*  Who comes next? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=615.1600000000001s)]
*  We don't live in Chicago. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  We're not even going to speculate on the state of local politics in that city. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  All we know is the most flamboyantly horrible mayor in the country was punished. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=620.32s)]
*  The system worked. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  And if it worked in Chicago, maybe it could work in New Orleans where Latoya Cantrell [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  is quickly destroying one of the most charming cities in the world. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=631.1600000000001s)]
*  But part of us, if we're being honest, will miss Lori Lightfoot. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=636.66s)]
*  Despite all the human suffering she caused, there's part of us that kind of enjoyed it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  By embodying every one of her party's excesses over the past four years, Lori Lightfoot inadvertently [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=644.74s)]
*  helped to expose them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=651.26s)]
*  Here you had a complete buffoon, someone who ran around bragging about having a large penis [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=653.4599999999999s)]
*  with, or just telling you what she said, somehow running one of the greatest cities in the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=659.4599999999999s)]
*  world. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=663.74s)]
*  At times it didn't seem like even Lori Lightfoot could believe she was mayor. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=665.14s)]
*  She clearly didn't really care for the job. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=669.3s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=673.02s)]
*  Happy Halloween everyone. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=674.02s)]
*  Happy Halloween! [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=694.9s)]
*  Drona Destroyers! [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=696.9s)]
*  And I'm happy to report I'm calling out the Census Cowboy. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=704.02s)]
*  Just save the tape, save the tape. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=721.46s)]
*  That's always our council. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=723.62s)]
*  From May of 2020 till now, March 1st of 2023, American politicians, the entire class have [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=725.1s)]
*  gone completely insane and a lot of it is caught on video. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7l_TVlRAw&t=733.74s)]
