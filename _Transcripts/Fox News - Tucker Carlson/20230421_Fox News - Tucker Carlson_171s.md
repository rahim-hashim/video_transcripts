# Miranda Devine: This might be the breakthrough Biden story
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8)
*  Miranda Devine, as always, is on it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=0.0s)]
*  She's with the New York Post. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=1.92s)]
*  Helped break the Hunter Biden laptop story [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=3.0s)]
*  in the first place, joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=4.48s)]
*  Miranda, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=5.8s)]
*  This doesn't seem like partisan rock throwing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=7.72s)]
*  This seems like an actual story to me, is it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=11.36s)]
*  Yes, and look, I think this might be the breakthrough story [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=15.88s)]
*  because really the coverup of Biden corruption [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=19.48s)]
*  is like Watergate now bigger than the original story. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=23.12s)]
*  It involves the FBI, the CIA. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=27.12s)]
*  Now you're seeing this quite honest, upright, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=30.64s)]
*  completely non-partisan, career IRS criminal investigator [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  who has a lot of big scalps under his belt [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  and is just treating the Hunter Biden story [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=45.08s)]
*  like he did any other case, is furious. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=48.2s)]
*  He's been stymied. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=51.92s)]
*  He sees that there's been political interference [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=53.6s)]
*  and obstruction in the case. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=56.28s)]
*  And then I think what really set him off [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=58.72s)]
*  and made him go to the Inspector General [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=62.2s)]
*  of the Department of Justice [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=64.68s)]
*  and turn into a protected whistleblower [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=65.92s)]
*  was seeing a month ago Merrick Garland appear [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=68.48s)]
*  at an oversight hearing and give very misleading testimony. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=72.4s)]
*  You know, he was asked specifically by Chuck Grassley, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=78.2s)]
*  is the US attorney in Delaware able to bring charges [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=82.4s)]
*  in California and in Washington DC? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=87.2s)]
*  Well, these are the two jurisdictions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  where Hunter Biden lived and should have paid taxes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=92.12s)]
*  And Merrick Garland assured Grassley, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=96.96s)]
*  oh yes, David Weiss has every authority and power [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=100.36s)]
*  that he needs and I'm backing him up [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=104.44s)]
*  and this is all very independent. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=106.84s)]
*  That is just the opposite of the truth. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=108.84s)]
*  And really if Merrick Garland doesn't know [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  that he's not doing his job properly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=114.4s)]
*  If Merrick Garland can be shown to have lied [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=118.72s)]
*  under oath to the Congress, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=121.08s)]
*  I mean, the Attorney General of the United States [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=122.52s)]
*  can't commit crimes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=124.08s)]
*  I mean, by definition, that's gotta be the end of him [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=125.44s)]
*  as our Attorney General, I would think. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=128.48s)]
*  Well, it would be if you could ever prove it, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=131.88s)]
*  but all of these people are clever. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=133.6s)]
*  They have plausible deniability. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=136.08s)]
*  They have layer upon layer [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=138.12s)]
*  in which they can pretend [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=140.32s)]
*  that they don't know what's happened. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=142.0s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden's entire business model is all about. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=143.92s)]
*  His relatives go and get the bribes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=148.0s)]
*  and he pretends he doesn't know about it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=151.12s)]
*  That's such a smart point. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=153.72s)]
*  Wayne Irvine, thank you so much for that summary tonight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=155.72s)]
*  We'll be talking again, I hope. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=157.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=160.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXexEbaBj8&t=170.28s)]
