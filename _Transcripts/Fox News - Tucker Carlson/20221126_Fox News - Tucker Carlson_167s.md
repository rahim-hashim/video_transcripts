# Biden picked up the mantra from Barack Obama: Victor Davis Hanson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc)
*  We are honored to welcome Victor Davis Hansen, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=0.0s)]
*  and one of the smartest people we know. Professor, thanks so much for joining us. So [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=3.84s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear where we are, how we got here, what next. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=7.76s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, Tucker, we had a midterm referendum on the Biden administration and they [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=14.32s)]
*  not only didn't articulate what they were doing, they didn't defend it and worse yet, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  they didn't promise to change. And so they look at the referendum, the midterms, and they think, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  you know what, inflation, oil prices, we didn't even talk about it. Instead, we called our enemies [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  semi-fascists, we said they were un-American, we said women were dying all over the country when [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=37.36s)]
*  they can't get abortions, and that was a successful formula. So we're going to do what we did before. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  We're going to double down on it. We would rather be ideologically correct [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  than worry about the American people, the middle class. This is exactly what he promised on the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  campaign trail in 2020. He said he was going to eliminate fossil fuel. He just picked up the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  mantra from Barack Obama who said he was going to make electricity prices skyrocket when he shut [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=62.72s)]
*  down coal. And Stephen Chu, the designated energy secretary in 2008, said he wanted European high [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=69.28s)]
*  prices. I think we got to get acculturated to the fact that this, as you said, was deliberate, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  it's going to continue, and they see it as a great good. They're never subject to the consequences [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=81.28s)]
*  of their own ideology, and they feel we stupid middle class people don't know what's good for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=88.0s)]
*  us. They do, and we've got to go down this green road into oblivion. And every once in a while, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=93.2s)]
*  when they get close to an election, they can tap the strategic petroleum reserve or they can [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=98.88s)]
*  get about half a trillion dollars student loan amnesty, and then after the midterms are over, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  we'll hear about all the layoffs or the bitcoin collapse of Mr. Bankman Fried, and then they can [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=111.6s)]
*  continue putting a little band-aid on the wound until the next election. But they're not going to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=117.52s)]
*  change, unfortunately. No, they're not going to change. And I think that's the key insight [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  right there. They're not going to change. And voters didn't force them to do the cycle, unfortunately. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Everything you've articulated, Tucker, is absolutely true, but they wouldn't disagree with you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  They would say, yes, this is the cost of transitioning to a green future, and there's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=138.8s)]
*  going to be some damage. It's not going to be us that are hurt, but they're not ashamed, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=143.44s)]
*  they're not apologetic. Yeah, until they ban private air travel, I'm not listening to a word [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=148.08s)]
*  they say, and I mean that. Victor Davis Hanson, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=152.88s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFqbrwkcxc&t=156.72s)]
