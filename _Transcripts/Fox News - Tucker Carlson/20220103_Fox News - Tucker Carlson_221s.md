# Candace Owens blasts AOC for bratty, immature response to critics
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE)
*  Mayor of New York has in the city of New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=0.0s)]
*  has a new mayor, his name is Eric Adams [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=2.84s)]
*  former subway cop seems like it could be a big improvement [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=4.8s)]
*  over Bill de Blasio. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=7.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, he has continued Bill de Blasio's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=8.2s)]
*  state of emergency based on COVID. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=11.36s)]
*  He's also continued the vaccine mandate [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=13.48s)]
*  for indoor venues, which is insane. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  So a lot of New Yorkers are continuing to flee to Florida [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=17.82s)]
*  and that would include New York Congress person [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=21.44s)]
*  Sandy Cortez, who the national media persistent calling AOC [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=23.84s)]
*  as if it's their job to make her myth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=27.44s)]
*  Let her do it herself. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=29.92s)]
*  Her name's not AOC, it's Sandy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=31.32s)]
*  That's what they called her. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=33.32s)]
*  Anyway, Sandy went to Florida on vacation [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=34.56s)]
*  with her boyfriend and of course she didn't wear a mask. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  She got caught on video not wearing a mask [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=38.44s)]
*  and got attacked. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=41.38s)]
*  Her defense, I'm a very sexy lady. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=42.24s)]
*  Quote, if Republicans are mad that they can't date me, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  they can just say that instead of projecting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=48.64s)]
*  their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend's feet. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=50.2s)]
*  You creepy weirdo. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=53.06s)]
*  Who's the creepy weirdo, Sandy? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  Anyway, Candace Owens is the host of Candace. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=58.06s)]
*  She joins us to figure out who the creepy weirdo is here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  Candace, great to see you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=63.38s)]
*  What do you make of her? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  I'm just too sexy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=66.06s)]
*  Like you can't criticize me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=66.9s)]
*  Does that work? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=68.3s)]
*  Listen, I saw this and I actually couldn't believe my eyes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=70.5s)]
*  and I tried to create a sober analysis [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=73.42s)]
*  of what made her tweet that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=75.38s)]
*  And by the way, it got worse. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=76.5s)]
*  She had a second tweet that said, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  there are sexual frustrations that underpin [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=78.9s)]
*  Republicans' critiques of me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=81.18s)]
*  Their fixation on me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=83.18s)]
*  So she's really actually creating a sexual narrative. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=84.5s)]
*  And in my sober analysis, I believe that she wasn't sober. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=86.78s)]
*  I think, you know, alcohol loosens your inhibitions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=90.06s)]
*  And I think that she was about 10 margaritas deep in Miami [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=92.7s)]
*  enjoying the free state of Florida. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=96.02s)]
*  And she wrote something that was honestly just filth. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  I mean, how bizarre and immature is it for any person, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=100.38s)]
*  any person that wants to be taken seriously as an adult, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=104.06s)]
*  to look at a fair critique of them as an elected official [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=106.82s)]
*  who has been barking about how Florida's doing everything [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=109.9s)]
*  wrong, about how bad Ron DeSantis is, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=112.22s)]
*  to see this critique and to offer back, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=114.32s)]
*  well, you know what, you just want to sleep with me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=116.5s)]
*  I mean, what are we even talking about? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=118.54s)]
*  Imagine if any male did this, an elected official. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=119.46s)]
*  Imagine if Rand Paul, you know, gets a critique [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=122.1s)]
*  or if any other person, even Joe Biden, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=124.38s)]
*  if Joe Biden was critiqued and they said, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=126.34s)]
*  sir, how can you say this about climate change? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=127.62s)]
*  And his response was, well, you just want to sleep with me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=129.42s)]
*  I mean, it's so bratty and it's so immature [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=131.94s)]
*  and it's so disgusting to even think about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=135.02s)]
*  And let me just say this in case there's any confusions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=137.34s)]
*  I have a lot of critiques of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=139.78s)]
*  I've had a lot of critiques since the very beginning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=142.7s)]
*  No, Sandy, I do not want to sleep with you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=144.58s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=148.06s)]
*  I mean, it does suggest enormously high self-esteem [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  bordering on narcissism. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=152.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if someone criticized you in your first thought [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  is they just want to have sex with me, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=156.9s)]
*  no, maybe they just don't like you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=157.86s)]
*  That's what I always assume when people criticize me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  I never think, oh, well, you're very attractive to me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, how crazy do you have to be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=163.86s)]
*  to think something like that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=165.38000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're trending every other week. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=166.22000000000003s)]
*  You're trending every other week. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's because I'm so sexy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  How creepy if you came back and said, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=169.66000000000003s)]
*  I'm trending every week because everybody thinks I'm sexy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=170.5s)]
*  and they're just venting their sexual frustrations. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=173.66s)]
*  Nobody would take you seriously [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=175.74s)]
*  because that's simply not how adults speak. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=177.18s)]
*  It's the way that teenage boys [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=179.74s)]
*  who derive sexual innuendos from everything, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=182.1s)]
*  that's how they speak and that's where she belongs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=184.5s)]
*  She has the mind of a middle schooler. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=186.7s)]
*  This is a 32-year-old woman. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=188.18s)]
*  It's really unacceptable, quite frankly, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=189.7s)]
*  and it is hilarious, but it's also unacceptable [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=191.66s)]
*  that she's actually an elected official [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=193.66s)]
*  that sits in Congress. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=195.1s)]
*  She's an absurd person. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=196.14s)]
*  I will say the thing about being a 52-year-old talk show host [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=197.26s)]
*  with four kids, everyone wants you, Candace. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=199.62s)]
*  It's like so insane, I just love it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, great to see you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=204.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwoMRz-EyHE&t=207.3s)]
