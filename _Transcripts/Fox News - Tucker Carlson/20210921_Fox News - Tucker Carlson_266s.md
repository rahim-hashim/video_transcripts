# Tucker: No one has been punished for this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ)
*  For weeks, the Biden administration told us that a drone strike had killed a group of ISIS-K terrorists, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  whatever that is, in Kabul. And there were secondary explosions that proved they were suicide bombers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=7.12s)]
*  But they were lying, forced by the New York Times to admit it. They've now conceded they killed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=13.84s)]
*  a number of innocent people, including children. Here's the interesting part. Mistakes happen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=19.04s)]
*  But in this case, no one in the Pentagon has been punished for this mistake or for lying about it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  We thought it'd be interesting to see what Tulsi Gabbard thinks about this. She's a former member [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=30.24s)]
*  of Congress from Hawaii. She served in Iraq as a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard. She's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=34.0s)]
*  still serving the country, the military. She joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=38.32s)]
*  on. So you get to lie. I mean, this will not shock you because you've seen it so much, but [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=42.24s)]
*  you get to lie about the loss of human life. You get caught and nothing happens to you. What kind [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=47.84s)]
*  of system is that? I mean, this kind of accountability is critical. I want to point [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=54.08s)]
*  out first that any time there are civilian casualties in war, it is tragic and terrible. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=59.76s)]
*  War is a terrible thing. And I think it's important for the American people to understand that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=67.44s)]
*  Islamist jihadists are continuing to wage war against us. And the Islamist ideology, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=72.96s)]
*  not the same as the religion of Islam, but this Islamist ideology, which is a political [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  ideology that inspired the terrorist attacks on our country on 9-11, is the greatest threat [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=85.6s)]
*  that we're facing right now in this country and the world. It is the foundation of governance of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  so-called Islamic countries like Turkey and Iran and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=97.36s)]
*  And it's what's behind the discriminatory policies that they have in these countries [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  against Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, and others. So as long as these Islamist jihadists [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=107.6s)]
*  are waging war against us, we have to work to defeat them militarily and ideologically. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  And militarily, we have two choices in how we do that. Number one, we can continue to invade [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=122.0s)]
*  and occupy and nation-building countries around the world just as we did in Afghanistan at great [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=127.36s)]
*  cost. Number two, we can take a targeted approach using airstrikes, using our special forces to go [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=133.36s)]
*  in and go after these terrorist cells. The reality is that the cost, the cost to the American people, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=140.8s)]
*  the cost to our troops, the cost to civilians will be far less if we take this very targeted [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  approach to go after these jihadist terrorist cells than if we continue making the very same [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  mistakes that we saw in Afghanistan and other parts of the world of invasion, occupation, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=157.84s)]
*  and nation-building. So in order to do that or to affect any successful military strategy, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=162.48s)]
*  you have to have competent people running things and doesn't competence require honesty and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=169.84s)]
*  accountability? And that's what I see missing here. It's like you can't, you're not allowed to lie to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=175.04s)]
*  the public which employs you, are you? The American people deserve honesty. They deserve leaders who [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=179.28s)]
*  lead with integrity and not those who shy away from their own responsibilities to the American [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=187.04s)]
*  people or look for a lower ranking fall guy to take the hit. The American people deserve [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  strong leadership that looks out for their best interests and the best interests of our country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=200.0s)]
*  When was the last time a general officer or someone, you know, Pentagon level commander [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=205.6s)]
*  in the U.S. military was punished for a mistake or is it it's always the corporals, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=211.6s)]
*  lieutenants, the captains? That's a really good question, Tucker, and I can tell you from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=217.04s)]
*  having just come off of active duty, having just come back from a deployment [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=222.88s)]
*  to Africa, there is a common frustration among service members when it is someone of a lower rank [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  who takes the hit for decisions and policies that were made far above their level. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=235.44s)]
*  It's so dishonorable that that whole way of governing anything, not just the military. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=241.68s)]
*  It's not leadership. No, it's not. It's not leadership at all. It's cowardice. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=246.96s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, welcome back. Thanks so much. Thanks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsXH7l3yiQ&t=250.56s)]
