# Kyle Rittenhouse taking new legal action
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA)
*  Kamala Harris and other figures in the Democratic Party [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=0.0s)]
*  encouraged the mob torching Kenosha, Wisconsin [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=3.4s)]
*  in the summer of 2020. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=7.12s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse decided to try to defend the city, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=8.78s)]
*  a car lot specifically, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=11.56s)]
*  he was asked by the owner to help defend the car lot [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=12.92s)]
*  because the police weren't there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=14.84s)]
*  He worked in Kenosha, his family's father lived there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=16.32s)]
*  So he shows up and a child molester tries to murder him [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=19.28s)]
*  and Kyle Rittenhouse defends himself. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=22.04s)]
*  Two other people tried to kill him too, one with a gun. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  So for doing that, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=27.78s)]
*  he was put on trial and charged with murder, he was acquitted. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=30.020000000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=32.34s)]
*  virtually every news organization in the country [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=33.18s)]
*  defamed him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=35.82s)]
*  They called him a murderer before the trial had ended [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=37.02s)]
*  and they called him repeatedly a white supremacist, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=39.46s)]
*  which he is not. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=41.7s)]
*  Tech platforms enabled that defamation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=43.02s)]
*  Now Kyle Rittenhouse is taking legal action against them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse is the founder [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  of the Media Accountability Project. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  Todd McMurtry is his lawyer. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=51.7s)]
*  They join us now to explain what they're doing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  Thanks to you both for coming on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=55.92s)]
*  Tell us Kyle, good to see you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  What action are you taking against the tech companies [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=61.04s)]
*  that made this defamation possible? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=63.24s)]
*  Well, we're gonna make the media pay for what they did to me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=66.4s)]
*  They made it hard for me to live a normal life. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=69.0s)]
*  I can't go out into public, I can't go to the store, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=71.2s)]
*  it's hard for me to go anywhere without security. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=74.56s)]
*  Shoot, doing basic things like taking my dog [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=77.48s)]
*  to the dog park is difficult. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  So they made it really difficult to be normal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=81.88s)]
*  and they affected future job opportunities to me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  I don't think I'll ever be able to work or get a job [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=88.68s)]
*  because I'm afraid an employer may not hire me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  I think that's entirely fair because of the lies [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=95.16s)]
*  repeated for over a year by the tech platforms [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=99.08s)]
*  that are not journalists, they're soldiers [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  in some sort of weird partisan war they're fighting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=105.94s)]
*  So what are you doing to rectify this? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, we're gonna be taking them to court. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=112.64s)]
*  Go ahead, Todd. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=116.36s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  Todd, tell us the legal action. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=119.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=120.92s)]
*  Okay, sure. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=122.48s)]
*  To answer your first question with regard [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=123.68s)]
*  to what we plan to do with the tech companies, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  of course we're looking at those [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  and I think the first one that I'm taking a look at [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=128.18s)]
*  is Facebook. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=130.06s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg announced in a videotape [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=132.0s)]
*  that what Kyle was involved in was a mass murder [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=134.96s)]
*  and that's clearly defamatory as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  That's not protected by Section 230, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=139.88s)]
*  the Communications Decency Act. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=141.82s)]
*  In my opinion, Section 230 allows you to take down [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=143.4s)]
*  violent things or things that people don't wanna hear [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=146.88s)]
*  but telling the truth about Kyle is not something [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  that Section 230 enabled Facebook to take down. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  So that's an example of what we plan to do with tech [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=155.76s)]
*  and also plan to do in the defamation arena. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  And by defamation arena, do you mean [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=161.68s)]
*  with so-called news organizations? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=163.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=167.18s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned some of that on the way in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=168.02s)]
*  and certainly Kyle was charged with a crime, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=170.72s)]
*  news organizations are allowed to report on that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=173.52s)]
*  but calling somebody a murderer in certain circumstances [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=176.16s)]
*  can be actionable. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=180.04s)]
*  Other things that media personalities, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=181.32s)]
*  people on social media said were clearly defamatory. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=185.04s)]
*  I think your comment about calling Kyle [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=188.16s)]
*  a white supremacist is made up out of thin air. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=190.4s)]
*  I don't know how a media can claim [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=193.4s)]
*  that they didn't make a statement made up out of thin air [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=195.5s)]
*  without engaging in actual malice [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=197.68s)]
*  or most certainly negligence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=199.96s)]
*  So I think that we have some strong grounds to proceed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=201.56s)]
*  We're looking at, we're starting to look at all those. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=205.24s)]
*  We're gonna evaluate them and look for opportunities [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=207.28s)]
*  to hold the media and to hold tech accountable [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=210.0s)]
*  as Kyle's promised. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=212.4s)]
*  So Kyle, when you go into public, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=213.88s)]
*  do people repeat to you things that they saw on social media [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=216.24s)]
*  or on say NBC News or CNN? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  There's been a few people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  I've received some harassment [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=224.8s)]
*  and thank goodness for my security, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=226.36s)]
*  LT, TC and Kenny and Dave for helping me [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=228.68s)]
*  not have to get harassed to make sure that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  they keep me safe and if somebody does come up to me, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=235.84s)]
*  they make sure that they're not gonna harm me. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=239.4s)]
*  So thank God for them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  And Todd, really quick, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=243.96s)]
*  how exactly are you gonna go after Zuckerberg? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=245.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're gonna sue A [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  for the defamatory statements that Kyle engaged [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=251.76s)]
*  in mass murder and B for violations of section 230 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=254.96s)]
*  by taking down posts that were told the truth about Kyle. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=258.4s)]
*  So in essence, they suppressed the truth [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=261.48s)]
*  by taking down truthful posts [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=263.52s)]
*  and they did that in violation of section 230. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=265.64s)]
*  That communication decency act [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=268.4s)]
*  does not provide that protection. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=270.2s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=271.8s)]
*  It's not just that they defamed him, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=272.64s)]
*  but they also took down any defensive him [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=274.64s)]
*  or the facts about him as they did with the vaccines [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=276.88s)]
*  and a million other things. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=279.08s)]
*  The war in Ukraine. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=280.28s)]
*  I appreciate what you all are doing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=283.52s)]
*  Kyle, great to see you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=284.44s)]
*  Thank you, Todd. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3kn1NuqnA&t=285.26s)]
