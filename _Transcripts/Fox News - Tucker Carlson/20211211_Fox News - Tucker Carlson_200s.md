# Tucker questions why Pentagon is still hiding UFO information
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0)
*  So the question here is, why is the government, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=0.0s)]
*  after promising not to do this repeatedly, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=3.9s)]
*  still hiding information on something [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=6.2s)]
*  that is very much in the public interest, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=8.1s)]
*  which is what are these things, these UFOs? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=9.94s)]
*  We know they're real, we don't know what they are. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=11.86s)]
*  Probably have a right to know that, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=13.38s)]
*  it's our government after all, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=14.36s)]
*  but they're still hiding it from us, why? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=15.3s)]
*  Lou Elizondo is one of the world's experts, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=17.42s)]
*  maybe the world's expert on this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=19.54s)]
*  He used to study UFOs for the Pentagon, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=21.54s)]
*  he joins us tonight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=23.02s)]
*  Lou, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=23.94s)]
*  So let's just go right to motive. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=25.88s)]
*  We know these are real, we know the Pentagon [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=28.2s)]
*  and we want to take some seriously, if not in public. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Why in the world would they still be hiding [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=32.4s)]
*  this information from us? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is kind of peculiar, isn't it, Tucker, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=36.76s)]
*  that really the day before Thanksgiving, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=38.76s)]
*  the Pentagon decides to announce the creation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=41.32s)]
*  of this office when they've had four years [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=43.96s)]
*  to do it beforehand. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=45.92s)]
*  I do think it is a good idea to have a centralized office. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=48.0s)]
*  I'm not so sure that it's good to put it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  where they want to put it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=54.2s)]
*  At the end of the day, the organization they want to put it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=55.92s)]
*  is under my old office, it's the Undersecretary of Defense [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=58.7s)]
*  for Intelligence, which is an oversight capability, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=61.26s)]
*  not an operational capability, and plus, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=64.7s)]
*  there are still some of the old elements [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=67.18s)]
*  in that organization that really didn't do us much favors [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=69.06s)]
*  when I was running the program four years ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=72.32s)]
*  Right, well that's obvious. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=74.5s)]
*  In fact, if it weren't for you effectively blowing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=76.18s)]
*  the whistle, we wouldn't be having this conversation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=78.5s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=79.98s)]
*  So speculate in your informed way about their motive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=80.82s)]
*  Like, what do they know that they don't want us to know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=84.62s)]
*  do you think? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=86.9s)]
*  Well, if I could be completely forthcoming, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  I think they don't know a lot, and that in itself [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  is probably what they don't want to necessarily [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  have a conversation about. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=96.6s)]
*  Even recently, when you listen to the Pentagon spokesperson, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=98.56s)]
*  no offense, but there's no indication that they're gonna be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  open and forthcoming with the American people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=105.44s)]
*  When you look at the legislation that has been presented [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=107.44s)]
*  in this NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=110.28s)]
*  this is historic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=113.74s)]
*  I mean, this basically tells the US government [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=115.16s)]
*  that both the Director of National Intelligence [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=118.54s)]
*  and the Secretary of Defense, you will report to Congress [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=119.58s)]
*  both at the classified and the unclassified versions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=123.14s)]
*  And oh, by the way, you're gonna create a field team. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=126.42s)]
*  You're gonna create a capability to go out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=128.86s)]
*  and not just sit back and relax and wait for information [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=131.06s)]
*  to come to you, but you now have to be proactive. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=133.18s)]
*  You have to go out and actually collect that information [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=135.5s)]
*  as it's happening, and then you have to report it to us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=138.32s)]
*  And last but not least, if there's information [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=140.7s)]
*  that you can't report because it's too classified, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=142.98s)]
*  you have to report that fact to Congress too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=145.66s)]
*  So this is really a fantastic, I think, I mean, it's huge. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  It's very comprehensive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=152.84s)]
*  It's pages and pages. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=154.2s)]
*  And I gotta tell you, I'm really, really proud [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=155.68s)]
*  of Congress for it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=157.48s)]
*  Really quick, I just wanna ask you a bottom line question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=158.32s)]
*  Do you know anybody who's deeply knowledgeable [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  on this subject, who studies at the Pentagon, for example, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=162.88s)]
*  who believes that these objects are from Russia and China, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=165.44s)]
*  who believes they're terrestrial, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=169.84s)]
*  they're foreign military aircraft? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  There's a couple individuals, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=173.04s)]
*  I'm not gonna call them out, that for whatever reason, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=174.46s)]
*  still remain extremely apprehensive about this topic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=177.06s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you know what? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=180.66s)]
*  I say, fine, let the data speak for itself. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=181.94s)]
*  Now that we've got a mechanism to actually collect [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=184.72s)]
*  and analyze this information, let the data speak for itself [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=187.22s)]
*  and then they'll come to the natural conclusion [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=190.46s)]
*  of what this is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=192.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty clearly not from Russia or China, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=193.94s)]
*  I would say, just my view. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=196.34s)]
*  Lou Elizondo, appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=197.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkrhpkjfv0&t=199.78s)]
