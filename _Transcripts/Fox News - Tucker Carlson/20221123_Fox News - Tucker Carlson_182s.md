# Largest no-kill dog rescue takes in canines left behind at US border
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y)
*  But as our borders are, inspects fish in the Philippines, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  we have a very real crisis here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=2.7s)]
*  Animal shelters overflowing with dogs [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=4.2s)]
*  that illegal aliens have ditched at the border. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And it really is a tragedy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=8.9s)]
*  Lori Simons runs the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=11.94s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=14.38s)]
*  Lori, thank you so much for calling our attention to this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=15.82s)]
*  and for doing something about it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=19.02s)]
*  So describe quickly, if you would, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=21.1s)]
*  the nature of the problem. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=22.68s)]
*  How big is this? Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=24.1s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker, for helping me bring this to light. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  It's a huge problem. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=29.9s)]
*  When we got down to Eagle Pass, down at the Rio Grande, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=33.14s)]
*  last week and saw hundreds and hundreds [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=37.3s)]
*  of starving and abandoned dogs left to fend for themselves [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=41.78s)]
*  from illegal immigrants that crossed the border [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=47.08s)]
*  with their dogs, then they get on buses [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=49.84s)]
*  and just leave them behind. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  These dogs can't survive on their own. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=55.18s)]
*  And the National Guard and a friend of mine [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=57.78s)]
*  from Blue Line Moving, who had gone down there [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=61.5s)]
*  to do a border cleanup, had reached out to us [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  and we were really shocked at just how big the problem was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=67.54s)]
*  and how much these animals were suffering. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=71.86s)]
*  And this couldn't come at a worse time, Tucker. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  Shelters throughout the country are overflowing everywhere. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=79.7s)]
*  Owner surrenders are up 60% throughout the country [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=84.9s)]
*  because people are having to make the hard choice [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=89.98s)]
*  of whether to feed their families [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=92.66s)]
*  and fill up their car with gas and heat their homes [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=95.38s)]
*  or give up their dog. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=99.42s)]
*  They just can't afford to care for them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, I would say anyone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  who'd abandoned a dog at the border [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  should not be allowed in this country [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=108.78s)]
*  and should be deported immediately. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=109.98s)]
*  We don't want people like that living here at all. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=111.22s)]
*  Second, how can our- I agree with you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=112.94s)]
*  Amen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=115.02s)]
*  It's really a sign of low character, in my opinion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=115.86s)]
*  So how can our viewers help? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=118.3s)]
*  You are running an effort to save these dogs [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=120.86s)]
*  who did nothing wrong or were abandoned. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=123.8s)]
*  How can people help? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=126.58s)]
*  Well, Big Dog Ranch Rescue is the largest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=128.66s)]
*  no-kill dog rescue in the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  With our Palm Beach County location, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=133.88s)]
*  we have 750 dogs there right now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=136.86s)]
*  We're overflowing, trying to rescue so many [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  and just opened an Alabama location. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=143.66s)]
*  You can please come adopt one of these dogs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=146.98s)]

*  and for also telling us about it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=166.18s)]
*  Lori Simons, thank you so much. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozG9EgmDN7Y&t=167.29999999999998s)]
