# Former Mumford & Sons member tells Tucker how his life ‘crumbled’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4)
*  Winston Marshall played lead guitar and banjo for the band Mumford and Sons, which became [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=0.0s)]
*  internationally famous and successful for good reason. They're great. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=5.76s)]
*  Then he made the mistake of mildly praising a book about Antifa writers that he read written by Andy Ngo. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=8.96s)]
*  And his life just changed in an instant. He became a political figure he didn't want to be. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=17.2s)]
*  And ultimately he was attacked so harshly he had to leave the band. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=22.92s)]
*  So we thought it'd be interesting to spend an hour with him and we just did for a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson Today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  He's a pretty amazing person actually, we discovered. Here's part of our conversation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=32.08s)]
*  The music industry and the creative industries more broadly was, you know, there was the, it was the black squares on social media. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=42.24s)]
*  And if you remember, there were a lot of actors and actresses fronting money to bail out the various rioters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=52.28s)]
*  And there was a big social media campaign, raise money here, and they were bailing out those who were arrested in the 2020 riots. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=63.28s)]
*  And so that's the actually the atmosphere. And I guess that's perhaps why what happened to me, happened to me is because it was so contrary to the prevailing politics, I guess, of the creative industries. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=72.72s)]
*  So I had very few followers, by the way, I think about 3000 followers on Twitter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=89.72s)]
*  Somehow this book, and it does, it honestly feels like an act of God, which I know that sounds a bit crazy, but it doesn't. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=93.72s)]
*  For the record, it doesn't sound crazy at all. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=102.72s)]
*  My life sort of started to crumble. Initially I was like, so what, it will pass. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=104.72s)]
*  But that's when you get the sort of phone calls from loved ones and friends and people you work with just panicking. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=109.72s)]
*  And so this dogpile actually became almost real life dogpile of just everyone in my life around me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=116.72s)]
*  And what was their complaint? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=128.72s)]
*  Well, I guess I, well, the people I were working with, they were getting attacked by these antifa, maybe not quite as much as me, but they were, you know, under they were getting harassed by these people as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=132.72s)]
*  And they're very effective online. Like, for example, there was a whole night where they were changing my Wikipedia page from Winston Marshall, Marshall is a banjo player to Winston Marshall is a fascist. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=145.72s)]
*  And it was just I had another friend trying to change it back and they're just all night like at it and they just swarm you like hornets and everything they do to try and destroy you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=158.72s)]
*  If you wind up with a society that cannot tolerate a man like Winston Marshall, who is rational, reasonable, decent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=169.72s)]
*  That's a problem. That's on you, not on Winston Marshall. That whole conversation is on Fox Nation right now. Well worth it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeB7jy7Mq4&t=179.72s)]
