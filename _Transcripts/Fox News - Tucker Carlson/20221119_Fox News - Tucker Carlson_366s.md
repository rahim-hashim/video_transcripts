# 'Canceled' Tripwire CEO tells Tucker 'social-terrorism' corners people into fear
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I)
*  So, we opened this show by telling you about the comedian Josh Denny, who has been silenced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=0.0s)]
*  as a comedian because he has pro-life views. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=4.64s)]
*  He's not the only one, though. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=7.32s)]
*  John Gibson was the CEO of Tripwire, a video game company. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=9.44s)]
*  He's a very famous video game developer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=13.52s)]
*  Last year, he tweeted this, and this is the whole tweet, quote, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=16.52s)]
*  Proud of the U.S. Supreme Court affirming the Texas law banning abortion for babies [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=19.44s)]
*  with a heartbeat. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=23.14s)]
*  As an entertainer, I don't get political often. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=24.14s)]
*  Yet with so many vocal peers on the other side of the issue, I felt it was important [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=26.44s)]
*  to go on the record as a pro-life game developer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=30.28s)]
*  That was it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=34.0s)]
*  He didn't threaten anyone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=35.0s)]
*  He didn't even attack anyone. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=36.28s)]
*  He just said what he believed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=38.04s)]
*  Well, for tweeting that, he lost his job, the company that he started and was majority [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=39.36s)]
*  owner of or had the largest ownership stake in, and then the media decided to destroy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=46.56s)]
*  him personally. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=51.0s)]
*  It was an unbelievable experience. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=52.0s)]
*  We spoke to John Gibson at length for an hour on Tucker Carlson Today about it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's part of the conversation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=58.12s)]
*  I call it social terrorism. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=64.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  It is an effort to use fear and intimidation to cause people to change, either hide or [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  pretend that they're not what they are really so that they can keep their jobs, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=78.92s)]
*  that they can keep their status. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  And I just think that's just a terrible thing for the world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=87.84s)]
*  Well, it's prima facie evil, for one thing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=92.36s)]
*  Terrorism is always wrong. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=95.92s)]
*  Everything should be voluntary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=98.84s)]
*  I mean, you can't force people to believe something. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=100.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=103.84s)]
*  You know, that's 8th century Islam. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=105.76s)]
*  Convert or be beheaded or something. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=107.56s)]
*  It's really—but there was not one person—and by the way, I wrote down social terrorism [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=109.12s)]
*  because I'm stealing that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm not giving you credit, sorry. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  No, that's such a great phrase, and it's a more precise phrase than cancel culture, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=117.0s)]
*  which is like pathetic and weak. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=120.28s)]
*  It doesn't describe the phenomenon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=122.56s)]
*  But just to be clear, there was not one person in your world who stood up and said, we cannot [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=124.44s)]
*  crush this man because he has a different view. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=130.6s)]
*  There was one person within the company, a lady that was resistant to what they were [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=134.96s)]
*  doing to me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=145.52s)]
*  Good for her. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=146.52s)]
*  And she was fairly senior, and I really appreciated her, you know, sort of standing up and pushing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=156.32s)]
*  But it was difficult for her, too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, she was outnumbered. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  But also, in the position she was in, she was having to deal with a lot of the fallout. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  And that's how this social terrorism works, is you make people scared, you make their [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  jobs more difficult, you make them worry that people are going to leave the company if they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  you know, throw the person who disagreed with their political positions out of the boat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=186.08s)]
*  And so she really couldn't overcome the wave of sentiment of the other folks. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=193.28s)]
*  And then the people that—the other people that agreed, they're afraid to speak up. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=202.08s)]
*  They don't want to be next. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=206.8s)]
*  I had one of the other owners of the company, politically, were very, very—were very aligned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=210.36s)]
*  He thinks cancel culture is bad. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=220.24s)]
*  He thinks abortion is bad. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  And he said, yeah, I don't want to be canceled next. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=225.68s)]
*  How heartbreaking was that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=230.96s)]
*  I mean, these are your friends. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  You created the company with them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=235.52s)]
*  And to see them participate in this must have just destroyed you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=238.04s)]
*  Tucker, words can hardly convey how crushed I was. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=242.04s)]
*  Everyone that works puts a little bit of themselves into something, or maybe a lot. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=253.44s)]
*  When you're doing something like this, it was a passion, something you used to do for [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=257.92s)]
*  And you just absolutely love it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=264.84s)]
*  And it's—you spent 20 years, 25 of years of your life crafting the skill set, and you're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=266.11999999999995s)]
*  at the top of your game. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=272.56s)]
*  And you love what you do every day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=275.4s)]
*  You just love coming into work and making people happy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  And we were making, sure, millions of fans happy, but also the company would take 10% [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=280.64s)]
*  of our profits and divide it up amongst the employees. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  And there was a lot of profit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  And people were out going—out and buying cars and houses. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  And I would see people coming into work smiling and happy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=294.6s)]
*  And I just loved having a job where I got to make not just the public happy, but the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  employees happy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=302.12s)]
*  And to have that all destroyed, to feel like—well, I shared something with my wife. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=303.88s)]
*  I'll tell you what I said to her. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=311.52s)]
*  I said—I said, I just want to die. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=313.72s)]
*  Because I don't want to live—I don't want to live in a world that's this unjust. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=319.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=324.56s)]
*  And, yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=325.56s)]
*  Yeah, I got depressed. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=328.56s)]
*  I got, of course, angry, suicidal, not wanting to leave the house. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it destroyed me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  And I have lived through 13 months of hell. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=345.88s)]
*  The entire episode will be available next week to stream on Fox Nation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ERPn7Us50I&t=350.84s)]
