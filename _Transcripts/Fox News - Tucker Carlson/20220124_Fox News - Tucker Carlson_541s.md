# Tucker: China is the certain winner here
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=0.0s)]
*  When permanent Washington pushes for war with Russia, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=2.4s)]
*  who benefits? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=5.34s)]
*  We don't ask that question enough. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=6.8s)]
*  The United States certainly doesn't benefit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=8.36s)]
*  That's obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a second. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=9.92s)]
*  It's so glaringly obvious in fact, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=12.64s)]
*  that the people pushing this war [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=14.96s)]
*  immediately denounce you as a traitor, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=16.68s)]
*  if you point that out. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=18.2s)]
*  They're betraying our country's interests, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=19.76s)]
*  but somehow you're the one who's disloyal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=21.38s)]
*  Ukraine's borders are sacred, our borders are racist. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=23.84s)]
*  Shut up, Putin stooge. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=26.12s)]
*  But wait a second, why is it disloyal to side with Russia, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=27.979999999999997s)]
*  but loyal to side with Ukraine? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  They're both foreign countries [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=34.3s)]
*  that don't care anything about the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=35.62s)]
*  Kind of strange. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=38.14s)]
*  It's all an absurd performance, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=39.66s)]
*  but it's all they've got in the end. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=41.1s)]
*  The fact is, Ukraine is strategically irrelevant [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=43.22s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=45.94s)]
*  No rational person could defend a war with Russia [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=46.9s)]
*  over Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=49.7s)]
*  Nobody thinks a war like that would make America safer, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  or stronger, or more prosperous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=53.84s)]
*  Have you taken a look at our economy recently? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=56.1s)]
*  Dangerous levels of inflation, a workforce in disarray, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=58.18s)]
*  wildly chaotic swings in financial markets, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  in case you haven't noticed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  Will joining a conflict in Eastern Europe fix any of that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=65.14s)]
*  Come on, of course not. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=68.54s)]
*  It'll make it worse. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=70.3s)]
*  If the neocons aren't restrained, and soon, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  Americans are going to be a lot poorer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  So why are they doing this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=77.12s)]
*  That's a complex question. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=78.78s)]
*  Hubris, stupidity, the damaged psychological makeup [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=80.32s)]
*  of our leaders, massive lobbying campaigns [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=83.3s)]
*  by Ukrainian politicians and American defense contractors, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=86.86s)]
*  all of those factors play a role in this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=89.54s)]
*  No tragedy has a single cause. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=91.18s)]
*  But what's not at all complicated is who benefits [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  from our conflict with Russia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=96.16s)]
*  China benefits, period. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=97.98s)]
*  The Chinese government is the only certain winner here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=100.62s)]
*  We can give you many examples to illustrate this, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=103.64s)]
*  but consider the latest economic sanctions [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  the White House has proposed against Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=107.18s)]
*  The Biden administration may use something [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=109.44s)]
*  called the Foreign Direct Product Rule [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  to cut off Russia's supply of semiconductors [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  made with American technology. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=115.36s)]
*  This would, in the hopeful assessment [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=117.52s)]
*  of the Washington Post, quote, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=119.44s)]
*  potentially deprive Russian citizens of some smartphones, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=121.08s)]
*  tablets, and video game consoles. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=124.6s)]
*  So depriving Russian citizens is good, we're told, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=127.16s)]
*  because Russian citizens are bad. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=129.76s)]
*  Okay, but what are the long-term effects on us? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=132.06s)]
*  Russians are still gonna have smartphones [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=136.2s)]
*  that'll just get their components somewhere else, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=138.12s)]
*  meaning from China. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=139.64s)]
*  The Chinese have already pledged to help, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=141.04s)]
*  and they have every incentive to make good on that promise. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=142.48s)]
*  In other words, the Biden administration will have succeeded [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  in continuing to drive our two main global rivals [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  closer to a permanent alliance with one another. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=150.44s)]
*  How does that help America? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=154.2s)]
*  Well, it doesn't. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  Over time, it's dangerous and not just militarily. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=157.33999999999997s)]
*  The only reason the US government [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=160.32s)]
*  can enforce international sanctions [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=161.54s)]
*  is because the US dollar is the world's reserve currency. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=163.28s)]
*  Russia and China don't like this, obviously. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=166.06s)]
*  So let's say they convinced other global powers [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  that the US government was abusing its monopoly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=170.92s)]
*  on monetary control. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=172.92s)]
*  If they do it to us, they might do it to you, they would say. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  And then other countries decided to drop the US dollar [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  in favor of a new currency. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=179.56s)]
*  Where would that leave us? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, suddenly the United States would no longer be able [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=183.92s)]
*  to run an economy based on debt. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  We would be impoverished immediately overnight. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=188.2s)]
*  Has no one in Washington thought of this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=192.16s)]
*  Apparently not. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=194.54s)]
*  Imposing tough new sanctions every few months [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  feeds their moral vanity. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  It makes them feel like good people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=200.12s)]
*  What fools they are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Both parties, by the way, participate in this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=203.84s)]
*  Preening about sanctions on television [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=205.76s)]
*  is a lot easier than improving the lives of people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=207.4s)]
*  in your own country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=209.54s)]
*  So that's what they do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=210.78s)]
*  Here's Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=212.44s)]
*  telling you that protecting Ukraine's sacred borders [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=215.04s)]
*  is much more important than, say, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=217.8s)]
*  saving Americans in Des Moines from overdosing on drugs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=219.8s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=223.24s)]
*  So we do need to go ahead and impose sanctions on Russia now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=224.84s)]
*  We need to show them that we mean business [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=229.18s)]
*  and we will be there for Ukraine should they invade. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  Certainly we need to make sure that any defensive aid [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=234.82s)]
*  is in the hands of the Ukrainians, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=238.02s)]
*  as well as as much lethal aid as we can provide at this time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=239.86s)]
*  Those are our leaders. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  Totally ignorant. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=246.46s)]
*  Just reading the script. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=247.58s)]
*  It'd be nice to hear someone in the press corps, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=249.06s)]
*  because it's their job, ask the obvious follow-up, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=251.02s)]
*  which would be, why exactly, Senator Ernst, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=253.62s)]
*  do you believe it's so vital [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=256.3s)]
*  to send more lethal aid to Ukraine and to, quote, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=257.66s)]
*  go ahead and impose more sanctions on Russia? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=260.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  How would she answer that question? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  We'll never know how she'd answer it, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  because no one in the media would ever ask her. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=267.54s)]
*  Reporters are the most bovine of the herd animals. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  If the other kids say it's a good idea, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=272.74s)]
*  they assume that it is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Journalists feel that way about everything, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=275.54s)]
*  but especially about armed conflict. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=277.38s)]
*  The longest war in American history just ended this fall [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=280.18s)]
*  when we left Afghanistan. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  The new consensus in Washington is, we need another war. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, and that view is especially prevalent in TV news. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=287.62s)]
*  Watch this teleprompter jockey try to push [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=291.58s)]
*  our Russia-hating Secretary of State [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=293.86s)]
*  into hating Russia even more. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=295.82s)]
*  We are proceeding on both paths at the same time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=298.58s)]
*  We'll be ready either way. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=300.54s)]
*  The choice is Vladimir Putin's. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=301.98s)]
*  But what are you negotiating? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=303.54s)]
*  If Russia's demands are non-starters, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=305.38s)]
*  I mean, President Biden has already said [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=307.26s)]
*  Ukraine's not gonna join NATO anytime soon. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=308.74s)]
*  You've made this offer of reciprocal military exercises. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=311.42s)]
*  What's left to talk about? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=314.7s)]
*  What's left to talk about? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=317.24s)]
*  Too much diplomacy, Mr. Secretary, not enough killing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=318.72s)]
*  That's her position, apparently. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=322.56s)]
*  Max Boot of the Washington Post fervently agrees with this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=325.18s)]
*  At this point, every project in Max Boot's life [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=327.32s)]
*  has collapsed into disaster, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=330.2s)]
*  from his personal affairs to the war in Iraq, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  which he promoted endlessly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=334.48s)]
*  Having come to middle age, Max Boot is [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=336.6s)]
*  unequivocally a failure. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  But he's looking for one last war to redeem it all. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=340.04s)]
*  He's thinking conflict with nuclear-armed Russia [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=342.98s)]
*  could be that war. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  We should be arming the Ukrainians like crazy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  We should be preparing for guerrilla warfare [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=351.18s)]
*  if the Russians go in. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think the most important thing we can do right now [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  is to lay out a menu of sanctions [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=357.68s)]
*  so that Putin knows exactly what's gonna happen to him [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=360.36s)]
*  if he goes over the line. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=363.0s)]
*  Because right now, with these vague threats, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  he can be left with the feeling, well, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  maybe the US and the Europeans, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=369.72s)]
*  maybe we're not really gonna do anything. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=371.68s)]
*  Again, you have to ask yourself, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=373.96s)]
*  why is it more, quote, patriotic to take one countryside [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=375.44s)]
*  than the other countryside? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=379.64s)]
*  We have no obligation to defend any country, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=381.96s)]
*  either one of these countries. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Neither one is American, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  neither one has the same interests as we do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  Why is it wrong to support one and not the other? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=390.74s)]
*  What's wrong is to support either one of them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Their interests are not the same as ours. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=396.76s)]
*  They're very different. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=398.74s)]
*  Max Boot doesn't care. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=399.84s)]
*  Arm the Ukrainians, prepare for guerrilla warfare. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=400.92s)]
*  Only a man completely insulated from the consequences [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=405.68s)]
*  of his bloodlust could talk like that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  There will always be another think tank job for Max Boot, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=410.36s)]
*  and people like Max Boot. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=413.22s)]
*  But what's Politico's excuse? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  The fashionably liberal political blog [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=417.36s)]
*  has been pushing for war in Ukraine for months now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  Why? What's in it for them? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  A few days ago, Politico published [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=424.68s)]
*  this terrifying headline, quote, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  Saki. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=427.76s)]
*  Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=428.92s)]
*  The piece goes on to promise that, quote, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=432.32s)]
*  experts and policymakers are now preparing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=434.52s)]
*  for a range of escalatory measures. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=436.76s)]
*  Well, that sounds scary. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  We better send billions more in military hardware [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  to Ukraine right away. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=443.84s)]
*  Beneath the headline, you learn why Politico's interested [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  because the story is, quote, presented by Lockheed Martin. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=448.84s)]
*  Aha. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=453.44s)]
*  In other words, defense contractors think [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=454.4s)]
*  it is high time to spend much more [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=457.04s)]
*  on defense contracting in Ukraine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=458.8s)]
*  Politico is happy to make their case in exchange for money. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  Over at the Washington Post, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  you may have seen this op-ed with this headline, quote, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=466.76000000000005s)]
*  Biden must show that the United States stands ready [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=469.44s)]
*  to support Ukraine militarily if necessary. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, that piece was written by a man called Michael Vickers. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=476.44s)]
*  Who's Michael Vickers? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, among other things, Michael Vickers sits on the board [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=479.72s)]
*  of the weapons contractor BAE Systems. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Now, that would seem relevant because war with Russia [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=485.52s)]
*  would be, potentially in any case, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=488.08s)]
*  highly profitable for BAE Systems. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=490.12s)]
*  But somehow, the Washington Post didn't bother [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  to tell readers about this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=495.84s)]
*  It remained undisclosed. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  So how does this look from across the world? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, the Chinese must be watching this happen [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=502.4s)]
*  with their jaws open, completely delighted. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  They can't believe their good fortune. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  They watch as the entire political leadership class [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=508.56s)]
*  of the United States runs at full speed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=511.52s)]
*  in the wrong direction, away from Asia, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=513.8s)]
*  which is so clearly the future, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=517.04s)]
*  and toward the murky past on the fringes of Eastern Europe. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=518.92s)]
*  Ukraine, Russia! [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=521.8s)]
*  And the Chinese must be wondering, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=524.04s)]
*  how could these people be so stupid and so self-destructive? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T04PpSLYCcE&t=526.0799999999999s)]
