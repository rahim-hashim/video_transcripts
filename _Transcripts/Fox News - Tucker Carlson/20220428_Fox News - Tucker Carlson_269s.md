# GOP lawmaker rips DHS Mayorkas: 'Secretary of Asylum and Amnesty'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc)
*  Well, in a development that doesn't really sound real and you couldn't imagine might [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=0.0s)]
*  happen in the United States of America, we told you about it earlier in the show, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=5.32s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security, a law enforcement agency, has decided to censor American citizens [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=8.4s)]
*  who disagree with Joe Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=13.64s)]
*  But that's not their job, it turns out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=15.5s)]
*  Their job is not to destroy the First Amendment and threaten you to get you to shut up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=17.72s)]
*  Their job is, among other things, to protect our southern border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=21.5s)]
*  But they're not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=24.16s)]
*  Millions of illegal migrants have already crossed, and hundreds of these migrants have gang [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=25.16s)]
*  affiliations, some are on a terror watch list. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=28.72s)]
*  So Congressman Chipoy represents the state of Texas where most of this is happening, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=31.84s)]
*  and he just questioned the Secretary of DHS, Alejandro Mayorkas, about what the heck is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=35.36s)]
*  going on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=40.0s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=41.0s)]
*  Will you testify under oath right now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=42.0s)]
*  Do we have operational control? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=44.48s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=46.56s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=47.56s)]
*  We have operational control of the borders. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=48.56s)]
*  Yes, we do, and Congressman, we are working to... [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=49.56s)]
*  Listen, what operational control defined. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  In this section, the term operational control means the prevention of all unlawful entries [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=53.92s)]
*  into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=57.7s)]
*  of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=61.86s)]
*  How about the dead bodies found by migrants? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=64.22s)]
*  Compassion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=66.98s)]
*  That was Congressman Chiproy of Texas who joins us tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=67.98s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=72.06s)]
*  You seem, you know, there's a lot of kabuki in these hearings. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=73.94s)]
*  You seem genuinely upset. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  I am upset, Tucker. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=79.58s)]
*  Look, I represent Texas, and I spend a lot of time down at the border. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=80.98s)]
*  I was at Del Rio just about a month ago. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=84.18s)]
*  I was at Eagle Pass just this Monday, and I've talked to ranchers and I watched a 65-year-old [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=86.94s)]
*  rancher, a tough Texan, break down in tears because of what's happening to his ranch, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=92.05999999999999s)]
*  finding dead bodies of migrants on their ranch. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=96.13999999999999s)]
*  I talked to people who have lost their kids to fentanyl and the impact that cartels are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  having on the border. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=104.3s)]
*  And look, if your blood isn't clotted because of Lord Fauci, then your blood is boiling [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=105.3s)]
*  as an American based on what you just saw from the Secretary of Asylum and Amnesty, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=110.6s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas, because that's what he is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=117.24s)]
*  He's allowing, you know, essentially asylum to become the exception that swallows the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  rule of border security. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=125.1s)]
*  And he's jamming through millions of people to flood our borders, overwhelm Border Patrol, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=126.8s)]
*  and you, the American people, your kids are the ones that are getting hit by it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  The fentanyl that's killing people in your schools, the ranchers are getting overrun, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=137.56s)]
*  the livestock that is dying, the fact that cartels are making tens of millions of dollars. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=141.52s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=145.96s)]
*  He's doing it in the false name of compassion. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=146.96s)]
*  Patent himself on the back like a good liberal, compassionate liberalism. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=149.08s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=153.2s)]
*  I showed him pictures of body trailers, the mobile morgues that are in Brooks County, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=154.2s)]
*  Texas, where there's a hundred bodies found. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  He didn't even blink. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=161.26s)]
*  He didn't bat an eye. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=162.36s)]
*  And don't apologize for Mayorkas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=163.74s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=165.6s)]
*  He's a former federal prosecutor, the former head of USCIS, a deputy DHS secretary. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=166.92s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=173.6s)]
*  It's purposeful. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=175.0s)]
*  They're trying to overrun our border, overwhelm Border Patrol in the name of asylum. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=176.2s)]
*  And the American people have had it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=180.22s)]
*  So spending like $30 billion in two months to protect Ukraine's borders, you'd think [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=181.98s)]
*  we'd be against invasions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  Were obviously for invasions if they happen here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  Did Mayorkas say anything in response? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=191.64s)]
*  Like, how did he answer your question? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  All he said was that he was for amnesty. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=196.92s)]
*  And that tells you a lot. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=199.04s)]
*  In fact, more than amnesty, he's for citizenship. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=200.04s)]
*  And that's a real tell. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=203.04s)]
*  And he certainly didn't give a rip when I said, look, Mr. Secretary, I've talked to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  Border Patrol and I said, you know what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  There were a million people released last year. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  If I doubled your Border Patrol budget, tripled it, quadrupled it, would that number go up [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=213.0s)]
*  or down? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  And every Border Patrol person I've talked to in Texas, they say, well, that number will [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  go up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=221.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=222.56s)]
*  Because you're attracting more people to come. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=223.56s)]
*  Because you have people, if you have Border Patrol agents locked arm to arm from McAllen [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=224.72s)]
*  all the way to El Paso, if your policies allow you to release a million people, you'll just [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=229.0s)]
*  release more. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=234.0s)]
*  He knows it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=235.32s)]
*  And he doesn't care that that's empowering cartels. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=236.32s)]
*  And that's the actual fact of what's going on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=239.12s)]
*  And the American people need to know that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=241.76s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas doesn't care about you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=243.64s)]
*  He cares about flooding the zone here in the United States and endangering Americans. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=245.56s)]
*  At a time when we have food and energy shortages, we're bringing in 2 million new people illegally. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=249.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=253.12s)]
*  That tells you how they feel about our country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=254.16s)]
*  Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=255.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O7eDn2puc&t=257.96s)]
