# Tucker: The government hid this from you about Jan 6
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM)
*  So last night we talked to a lawyer who represented January 6th defendant Jacob Chansley, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=0.0s)]
*  so-called QAnon shaman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=4.84s)]
*  The lawyer told us that the government, the prosecutors in this case, in violation of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=6.74s)]
*  the Constitution, hid exculpatory evidence from him and the defense in order to send [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=10.48s)]
*  Jacob Chansley to prison for four years, where he is tonight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=16.72s)]
*  Now we showed you that evidence this week. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  It's surveillance footage that shows federal officers leading Jacob Chansley around the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=22.96s)]
*  Capitol like tour guides. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=27.22s)]
*  At one point they even opened the door of the hallowed Senate chamber for him and usher [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=28.54s)]
*  him in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=34.42s)]
*  So, the tape proves conclusively that Jacob Chansley, whose every action inside the building [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=35.42s)]
*  was videotaped, committed no felony. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=40.92s)]
*  And the government hid that fact. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=43.36s)]
*  And because they did, the media were allowed to paint Jacob Chansley as a dangerous terrorist [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=45.3s)]
*  who deserved to be killed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=50.14s)]
*  I think the most amazing thing about the whole thing is watching the video and on the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=52.14s)]
*  Senate floor there's a cop who's armed and a guy bursts in the QAnon shaman, dressed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=57.4s)]
*  like a viking, and he basically talks to him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=64.24s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=68.28s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=69.28s)]
*  Shoot him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=70.28s)]
*  Like, if it, you burst into the United States, if he was dressed like Bin Laden, would you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=71.28s)]
*  have shot him? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=77.56s)]
*  If they said that about someone you loved. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=80.98s)]
*  Well, now we know that the Biden administration created that perception that this man should [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=84.18s)]
*  be killed and then broke the law specifically to destroy the life of American citizen and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=89.14s)]
*  naval veteran Jacob Chansley, who again remains in prison tonight. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=95.06s)]
*  The question is what happens next? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=98.1s)]
*  Martha Chansley is Jacob Chansley's mother. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=99.66s)]
*  William Shipley is his attorney and they join us tonight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=101.98s)]
*  Martha Chansley, thank you so much. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=105.14s)]
*  First to you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=106.98s)]
*  What's it like? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=108.16s)]
*  What has it been like for the last 26 months to see people like Steve Schmidt of the Lincoln [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=109.34s)]
*  Project on television calling for the killing of your son? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  What has it been like? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=119.24s)]
*  It's an awful thing to say. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=121.86s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=124.58s)]
*  I can't even, honestly, I can't even imagine even saying that for somebody who just walked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=127.5s)]
*  through open doors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=133.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=135.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=136.06s)]
*  How does it feel to know that the U.S. government, the Biden administration hid this evidence [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=137.56s)]
*  and on the basis of that lie and crime, sent your son to prison for years? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=145.44s)]
*  It's upsetting. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=151.76s)]
*  It's upsetting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=153.24s)]
*  It should have come out two years ago. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=154.24s)]
*  That should have come out two years ago. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=158.0s)]
*  He's an innocent man. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=160.36s)]
*  Everything that he said that he did is true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=161.72s)]
*  That he walked through open doors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=166.1s)]
*  He was escorted through the halls and the Senate. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=168.22s)]
*  And part of the reason why he was escorted was because he volunteered to help them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  He said that he saw people in the Senate and that he wanted to help them in any way he [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=178.98s)]
*  could. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=186.06s)]
*  And that's part of the reason why he was let around. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=187.54s)]
*  It's very obvious. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=190.5s)]
*  So, Mary, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=191.5s)]
*  So this show confirms today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=192.82s)]
*  And thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=194.18s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=195.18s)]
*  We confirmed today that the Capitol Police turned over all the video, including the video [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=196.62s)]
*  you just saw of Jacob Janszler, your client, to the FBI right after January 6th. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=201.46s)]
*  So the FBI had this videotape and they withheld it from his initial lawyer in his defense. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=205.9s)]
*  How is he still in prison tonight? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=210.94s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=213.9s)]
*  Sorry, am I supposed to say or is... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=215.9s)]
*  No, I was just asking. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=219.18s)]
*  The attorney here, as a legal matter, how was this... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=221.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=223.18s)]
*  How was your son still behind bars? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=224.18s)]
*  Well, Jake did not have a lot of post-conviction options. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=225.18s)]
*  The plea agreement that Albert Watkins talked him into signing waived all of his appeal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=229.9s)]
*  rights. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=233.74s)]
*  So he had no opportunity to go to the Circuit Court of Appeals to raise any issues connected [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=234.74s)]
*  to his conviction. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=238.86s)]
*  He had limited rights to challenge the performance of Albert Watkins as his lawyer. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=240.62s)]
*  When I came into the case, that's the first subject I began discussing with him, was [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=247.32s)]
*  my criticisms of what Watkins talked him into doing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=251.64s)]
*  It was a terrible plea agreement. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  It was an unconscionable plea agreement. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=257.04s)]
*  I've done this for 35 years. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=259.92s)]
*  I recognized immediately what Watkins had done wrong. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=261.92s)]
*  Watkins had him plead guilty before the government was even willing to say it had produced all [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=265.96s)]
*  the video. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=270.24s)]
*  The government in August of 2021 was still telling judges, we haven't been able to get [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=271.24s)]
*  all of the evidence to defense lawyers, so please don't set trial dates. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=276.16s)]
*  Albert Watkins didn't care. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=281.32s)]
*  He convinced his client to take the offer the government made and plead guilty. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=282.8s)]
*  So he's in a little bit of a mousetrap. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=287.48s)]
*  But now that we know that this was a travesty, I mean, the people responsible for it should [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=290.92s)]
*  be punished. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=295.84s)]
*  Liz Cheney should lose her job today as a professor at the University of Virginia. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=296.84s)]
*  She knew this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=300.1s)]
*  She destroyed a man's life. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=301.1s)]
*  But how do you get Jacob Chansley out of jail now? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=302.36s)]
*  We're looking at that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=306.12s)]
*  I'm not sure there's an easy solution. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=307.32s)]
*  There's not an easy road to that, to get the matter back in before Judge Lamberth and the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=309.56s)]
*  district court here and to have him reconsider his sentence. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=315.12s)]
*  In many ways, it's procedurally barred. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=319.12s)]
*  We're going to have to come up with a creative way to get it back before Judge Lamberth. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=321.08s)]
*  Frankly, I think Judge Lamberth may be a little bit unhappy that, you know, the government [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=324.88s)]
*  presented some videos at the sentencing to paint Jacob in the worst possible light, the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=330.82s)]
*  way they described him in court as, you know, the face of the insurrection, violent. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=336.42s)]
*  And then, you know, Judge Lamberth, frankly, he gave him the sentence that Albert Watkins [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=343.82s)]
*  negotiated. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=348.1s)]
*  The sentence in the plea agreement was 41 to 51 months, and Judge Lamberth gave him [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  41 months. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=353.18s)]
*  But I don't think Judge Lamberth today probably thinks he saw everything he needed to see [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=355.02s)]
*  when he made that decision. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=360.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=361.46s)]
*  I mean, this is just an open and shut travesty, as far as I'm concerned, and Godspeed to both [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=362.46s)]
*  of you getting this unjustly convicted man out of jail. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  Martha Chansley, William Shipley, his attorney, thank you both very much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=374.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=375.7s)]
*  We really appreciate you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-il4uS5mM&t=376.7s)]
