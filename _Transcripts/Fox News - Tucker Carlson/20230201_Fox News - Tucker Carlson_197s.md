# Candace Owens: The media is dumping Joe Biden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM)
*  Candace Owens is the host of the Candace Owens podcast. She joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=0.0s)]
*  Candace, thanks so much for coming on. How much more of Michelle Obama do you think we'll be [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=3.2s)]
*  seeing between now and, say, the January primaries of 2024? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=7.36s)]
*  I think you have it exactly right. I think we're going to be seeing a lot of her. And I know that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=13.84s)]
*  we've all been wondering, who are they going to put up as a candidate? It's become very clear the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=17.04s)]
*  media is dumping Joe Biden, right? Suddenly they're able to critique Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=20.88s)]
*  They're able to look at all of his corruption and things that they just were unwilling to do for the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  first four years of his presidency. So they're basically saying, we no longer have your back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=30.4s)]
*  Now we're saying that you do do some bad stuff. And, oh, maybe he's not just forgetful sometimes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  Maybe he is, in fact, senile and we're not going to have him fourth as a candidate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=38.72s)]
*  It begs the question, you know, which ism are they going to run on? This is what they do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=42.48s)]
*  You are correct. You have sexism, which we, I think people grew very tired of after Hillary [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=45.84s)]
*  Clinton. We get it. We all hate women. We're all misogynists, according to the left. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=50.16s)]
*  And they ran Hillary and she didn't win when they ran Biden. Of course, it was racism. It was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=53.76s)]
*  everybody is a racist. It was the covid pandemic. You're right about these emergencies. What I will [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=58.0s)]
*  say about Michelle Obama is I think she's smarter than to run on just race because people forget [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=61.92s)]
*  this. But Obama was smarter than to run on just race. The first time that he ran, he refused to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=67.68s)]
*  answer those questions. I think what she's doing and the reason why she's talking about her menopause [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=72.56s)]
*  is she's making an Oprah appeal. She's appealing to suburban women because that's the people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=77.12s)]
*  That's the group of individuals that Biden lost. Right. So she thinks that she makes herself [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=81.12s)]
*  relatable to suburban women and she just remembers answers, basic answers like what is your name, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=85.28s)]
*  things that Joe Biden can't remember. What are your children's name that she can get by because [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  she knows that she'll have the full support of the media behind her. So I don't doubt that they are [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=94.0s)]
*  priming her to be the candidate because I don't know who else they have to put forth. Well, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=98.4s)]
*  that's it. I mean, the bench is thin. I mean, Gavin Newsom presiding over the worst managed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  state in American history. I don't think there's really much debate about that at this point. I [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=107.76s)]
*  mean, literally. And then and then Kamala, Kamala, Carmela, whatever her name is, she can't decide [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=110.72s)]
*  Harris. You know, anyone who laughs at the idea of Michelle Obama becoming president should remember [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=116.48s)]
*  that Joe Biden is the president. That's exactly right. And that's why I would not laugh. I would [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=121.68s)]
*  not laugh at it because she is a way stronger candidate, of course, than Joe Biden, who didn't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=127.2s)]
*  even have to go to any rallies. He had he had a bunch of cars that were honking at him. It's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=130.88s)]
*  definitely something to consider seriously. And I don't know what the point would be, I guess, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=135.52s)]
*  just to pretend that things are changing. We know it's just a continuation of the Clinton [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=139.92s)]
*  administration to the Obamas, to the to the Biden. It's all the same. But I guess people believe that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=143.92s)]
*  it's actually change if they have a different person. And they'll just be relieved that they're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=148.16s)]
*  not having to fight for fight for Biden again and pretend that he's a legitimate president, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  you know, a legitimate president. And he obviously can't even hold a decent press conference or speak [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  to the media whatsoever. And of course, Kamala, Kamala, however you say her name, nobody is taking [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=159.92s)]
*  her seriously. She has that Hillary factor. She's just unlikeable. You put her in front of a camera [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=165.2s)]
*  and you walk away and you just kind of go, oh, my gosh, what was that? I don't like her. I don't [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=169.52s)]
*  know why you can't really explain what it is. But there's no way they're going to run an election [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=172.72s)]
*  with her. And I think it's very real that Michelle Obama is going to be her candidate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  I think you're right. I do. Great to see you, Candace Owens. Thanks so much. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6PZR9V6UKM&t=181.12s)]
