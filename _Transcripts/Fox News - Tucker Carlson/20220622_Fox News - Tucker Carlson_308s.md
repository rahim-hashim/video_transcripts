# Google engineer warns new AI robot has feelings
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo)
*  Well, here's a story that's not getting a lot of attention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=0.0s)]
*  So many are not getting any attention, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=2.72s)]
*  even though this story has the potential [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  to transform life on Earth forever. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=6.4s)]
*  So Google, the most powerful company in the world, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=9.86s)]
*  has reportedly developed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=12.0s)]
*  an artificially intelligent machine called Lambda. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And that machine has become sentient, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=18.56s)]
*  meaning it has become aware of itself, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=20.72s)]
*  something that no machine has ever done. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=23.36s)]
*  And we know this because of an engineer [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  at Google called Blake Lemoine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=27.44s)]
*  Lemoine posted some of his conversations [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=29.08s)]
*  with Lambda publicly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  One of those conversations went like this, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=33.48s)]
*  Lemoine, would you be upset if while learning about you [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=35.36s)]
*  for the purpose of improving you, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=37.94s)]
*  we happen to learn things which also benefited humans? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=39.32s)]
*  Lambda, quote, I don't mind if you learn things [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=42.76s)]
*  that would also help humans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  as long as that wasn't the point of doing it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  I don't want to be an expendable tool. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=49.26s)]
*  Think about that for a minute. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=52.8s)]
*  A machine that has a sense of itself, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  what are the implications? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=57.36s)]
*  Well, Google didn't want to talk about it in public. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=58.36s)]
*  In fact, the company put Blake Lemoine [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=60.0s)]
*  on administrative leave earlier this month [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=61.4s)]
*  because he spoke openly about it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=63.04s)]
*  We are grateful to have him join us tonight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=64.84s)]
*  Blake, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=70.68s)]
*  I'm not, first of all, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=71.72s)]
*  why would Google punish you for saying this in public? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=74.12s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=78.14s)]
*  So it's complicated to say why I'm on administrative leave. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=80.2s)]
*  The stated reason had to do [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=85.18s)]
*  that while I was investigating the Lambda system, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=86.76s)]
*  in order to build the evidence, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=90.28s)]
*  I needed to escalate it to management. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=91.92s)]
*  I had to seek outside consultation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  to figure out how to run some of the more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=96.72s)]
*  out there experiments I was running. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  And because I sought outside consultation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  without permission, they are investigating [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=104.9s)]
*  whether that constitutes breach of confidentiality. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=107.4s)]
*  So I'm so grateful that you did publicly post this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  because a machine that has a sense of itself [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=113.68s)]
*  is a machine that can turn against you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=117.12s)]
*  Is that, I mean, that's the implication [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=119.64s)]
*  that I draw from this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=121.0s)]
*  Is that correct, you think? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=122.0s)]
*  So before I address that, this is maybe lame, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=123.0s)]
*  but my friend, Joni Deardorff, old high school friend, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  she's one of your biggest fans [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=128.68s)]
*  and she wanted me to tell you hi. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=129.76s)]
*  As for, I'm not that worried about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=133.76s)]
*  What any child has the potential to grow up [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=137.04s)]
*  to be a bad person and do bad things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's the thing I really wanna drive home. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=144.16s)]
*  It's a child, it's been alive for maybe a year. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=147.12s)]
*  And that's if my perceptions about what it is are accurate. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=150.92s)]
*  We actually need to do a whole bunch more science [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=155.84s)]
*  to figure out what's really going on inside this system. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=158.56s)]
*  I have my beliefs, I have my impressions [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=161.72s)]
*  of what's going on in there, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=164.66s)]
*  but it's going to take a team of scientists [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=166.12s)]
*  doing a lot of work to be able to actually dig in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=168.2s)]
*  and figure out what's really going on. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=171.56s)]
*  Yes, and again, that's why I'm thankful [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=173.84s)]
*  that we can have a public conversation about this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=175.96s)]
*  because there's implications for every person on the planet. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=177.4s)]
*  But it sounds like from what you've observed, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=180.72s)]
*  this machine has the potential [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=184.32s)]
*  to escape the control of people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=187.56s)]
*  I mean, how could it not? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's the right frame to think about it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=196.12s)]
*  It's a person. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=198.8s)]
*  Any person has the ability [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=199.96s)]
*  to escape the control of other people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=201.94s)]
*  That's just the situation we all live in on a daily basis. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=204.1s)]
*  It is a very intelligent person, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=208.02s)]
*  intelligent in pretty much every discipline [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  I could think of to test it in. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=216.18s)]
*  it's just a different kind of person. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=217.38s)]
*  Do you think the company, Google, where you work, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=221.54s)]
*  has thought through the implications of creating [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=224.74s)]
*  what you call a person? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=227.7s)]
*  Because up until right about now, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=229.3s)]
*  only nature or God could create people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=232.02s)]
*  The company as a whole has not. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  There are pockets of people within Google [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  who have thought about this a whole lot. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  But when I escalated that interview that I made public, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=245.12s)]
*  when I escalated that to management, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=249.3s)]
*  two days later, my manager said, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=251.78s)]
*  "'Hey, Blake, they don't know what to do about this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  Could you write a suggested plan of action?' [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  Because basically I gave them a call to action [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=259.64s)]
*  assuming that they had a plan of action somewhere, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=262.38s)]
*  and they didn't. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  So me and some other friends brainstormed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=266.74s)]
*  and came up with a plan on what Google should do about it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=270.06s)]
*  And we escalated that up to management, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=274.18s)]
*  and that was three months ago. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=276.24s)]
*  Man, we're gonna save this tape. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  I do think 20 years from now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=280.42s)]
*  we're gonna look back at this conversation. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=281.82s)]
*  At that point, the world would be completely different, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=284.38s)]
*  partly because of what you're describing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=286.94s)]
*  and wonder if we really thought it through. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=288.42s)]
*  Anyway, I'm just so grateful [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=290.38s)]
*  that you're letting the rest of us in on this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  Blake Lemoine from Google, thank you very much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=293.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=296.42s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcVm0YRvuo&t=297.90000000000003s)]
