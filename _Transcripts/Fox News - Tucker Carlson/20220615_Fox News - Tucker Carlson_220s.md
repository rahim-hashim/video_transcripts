# Gas station owner makes 'gut-wrenching' decision to close after nearly five decades
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo)
*  Rens Mobile is a gas station in Amherst, Massachusetts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=0.0s)]
*  Renil Gladue has run that station for nearly 50 years, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=3.34s)]
*  but because of higher costs, he's had to close. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=5.94s)]
*  Renil Gladue joins us now with his son, Jeff, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=9.5s)]
*  who is the station's manager. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=11.46s)]
*  Thank you both for coming on tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=12.88s)]
*  So you- [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Tucker. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=16.46s)]
*  To you, Mr. Gladue, you've run it [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=17.94s)]
*  for almost five decades now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=19.42s)]
*  Can you be specific and tell us why you're closing now? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=21.46s)]
*  Sad. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=23.98s)]
*  The reason why I'm ready to close [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=25.52s)]
*  is because of the high prices of gas [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=29.96s)]
*  that I refuse to pass on to my consumers, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=32.52s)]
*  which are more than half our senior citizens [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=38.0s)]
*  that have been with me for 48 or some odd years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  What a horrible story. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=49.32s)]
*  So Jeff, you've obviously grown up around this business [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=50.72s)]
*  and now you're in it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=53.86000000000001s)]
*  You talk to people who buy gas for $5 a gallon. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=55.82s)]
*  There are a lot of people on fixed incomes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=59.06s)]
*  and you're part of Massachusetts. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  What does it mean to them? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=61.74s)]
*  It's gut wrenching, honestly it is. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=63.74s)]
*  And like my dad said, started working for my dad [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=65.78s)]
*  when I was 10 years old, just tagging along on Saturdays [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=69.4s)]
*  and on holidays and weekends. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=72.06s)]
*  And that was the highlight of my life, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=74.5s)]
*  being side by side with him and being out here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=76.7s)]
*  And most of those customers back in the late 70s, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=79.84s)]
*  early 80s were in their 40s and 50s. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=83.16s)]
*  And now as we've all moved on in our lives, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=86.0s)]
*  now we're getting in the twilights of their lives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=89.84s)]
*  And we had a lady come in here the other day [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=92.64s)]
*  absolutely crying because her husband died years ago [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=95.6s)]
*  and she's never put gas in her car. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  So she's like, how do I put gas in my car? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=100.92s)]
*  My dad and I, along with my son Ty, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=103.48s)]
*  have offered to take any senior citizen in our area [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=106.66s)]
*  that's one of our customers to an additional station, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=110.22s)]
*  one of our competitors, no doubt, to fill up their tanks [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  because we love our customers so much. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=116.42s)]
*  But you're closing, so you get three generations [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  working there, your family's revolved around this business [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  for 48 years and you're closing it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=126.04s)]
*  I mean, how do you feel about that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  It's heartbreaking, but I mean, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=131.38s)]
*  we're closing the gas portion of it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=134.04s)]
*  Repair-wise and used car business, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=137.1s)]
*  we'll try to keep aboard as long as we can, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=140.44s)]
*  but the bread and butter for us is gas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  And we've been in a bad contract with our supplier [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=144.84s)]
*  for the last five years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=148.62s)]
*  We've asked them to get out of the contract [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=150.26s)]
*  and they're holding it above us to not let us out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Now Mobile is leaning on them [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=156.76s)]
*  because of all the negative publicity that's come from this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=158.92s)]
*  So they sent up their territory manager [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=162.0s)]
*  as well as the vice president of operations the other day [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=164.92s)]
*  to ask us how they could fix this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=168.66s)]
*  How can we make this stop? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=171.38s)]
*  My dad said, let us out of our contract. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  They said, we can't do that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=175.54s)]
*  Let us give you gas a little bit cheaper [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=177.14s)]
*  than what you're paying for it now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=179.77999999999997s)]
*  Maybe extend the terms of your payment for the gas [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=181.94s)]
*  and give you some new gas pumps. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=186.54s)]
*  How would you feel about that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=187.98s)]
*  My dad said, we're done. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  We're done, that's it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=191.98s)]
*  We're no longer gonna supply you gas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  So another family business goes under. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  Gentlemen, good luck to you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your story tonight. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=202.44s)]
*  That's just the saddest thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=204.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=206.0s)]
*  You bet. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME-CoXXkvo&t=208.24s)]
