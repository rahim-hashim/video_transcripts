# Tucker Carlson: Why are we still funding this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY)
*  There's really only one thing that pretty much everybody in Washington agrees on, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=0.0s)]
*  that is our borders don't matter at all, but Ukraine's borders are holy and therefore [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=4.48s)]
*  the government of Ukraine, the authoritarian government of Ukraine, needs tens of billions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=8.34s)]
*  of dollars from US taxpayers immediately stop complaining, and by the way, indefinitely, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  forever. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=18.32s)]
*  Both parties in Washington agree with this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=20.88s)]
*  It's the single most important priority for the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  But every poll shows that actually it's not the number one issue for Americans. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=27.04s)]
*  The number one issue for actual Americans is inflation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=31.84s)]
*  So yesterday the president of Ukraine, Zelensky, was asked about the inflation that the funding [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=34.96s)]
*  of his country is causing here, and his response was this, and we're quoting, inflation is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=40.28s)]
*  nothing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=45.16s)]
*  Who is thinking about inflation? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=46.16s)]
*  These things are secondary. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=47.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Maybe to you, Mr. Zelensky. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=50.92s)]
*  But to Americans, they're actually kind of meaningful because our countries are not the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=54.28s)]
*  same. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=57.2s)]
*  One of you run yours, we'll run ours. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=58.2s)]
*  So Ukraine's leaders are really not hiding it anymore. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=60.08s)]
*  They have total contempt for us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  They just want our money. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=63.68s)]
*  They don't care about the United States even a little bit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=64.68s)]
*  This is not democracies uniting in solidarity. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=67.16s)]
*  This is a scam. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=70.1s)]
*  Every other week, Zelensky has appeared in public. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=72.0s)]
*  You may have noticed this with US politicians on hand, snuggling with Lindsey Graham once [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=74.48s)]
*  again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=80.16s)]
*  It's kind of weird that he never seems worried about his own safety since this is a war zone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=81.8s)]
*  He's met with a ton of Hollywood celebrities. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=85.8s)]
*  Here he is with Ben Stiller. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  Hello. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  Hi, sir. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Really nice to meet you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for taking the time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  It's a wonderful honor for me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  We know you very well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  It's a great honor for me, and nice to see you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  It's really wonderful. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  You're my hero. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  A lot, man. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  You quit a great acting career for this? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=108.36s)]
*  Not so great, but pretty great. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=111.36s)]
*  But what you've done in the way that you've rallied the country and for the world, it's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=114.36s)]
*  really inspiring. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=120.36s)]
*  Yeah, really, you're a hero. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=121.36s)]
*  This week, Zelensky got the Annie Leibovitz treatment at Vogue magazine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  He really is the beta work of Ukraine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=129.36s)]
*  This is real video uploaded by Vogue on Instagram. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=131.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=135.36s)]
*  It's all pretty insulting to the thousands of Ukrainians who have died and to the U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=137.76s)]
*  taxpayer who's funding all of this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=159.76s)]
*  But Ukraine's gotten away with it because with the complicity of the American media [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=162.56s)]
*  they have from day one waged a fierce information war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=165.88s)]
*  They lied about the ghost of Kiev. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=168.88s)]
*  They lied about the island where the troops told the battleship to F off. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=170.38s)]
*  They keep lying. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=174.68s)]
*  Now, you know, they can lie all they want, but why are we still funding this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=175.68s)]
*  Todd Wood is the founder of CD Media, is a former special operations pilot. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=179.78s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Todd, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  So at a certain point when the president of Ukraine, and again, he's allowed to worry [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  about his country, but we're also allowed to worry about ours. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=189.28s)]
*  And we don't even know where the money's going. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=193.28s)]
*  Clearly, a lot of it's being stolen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=197.48s)]
*  When he gives the finger to American taxpayers by saying your stupid worries about inflation [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=199.28s)]
*  mean nothing, how masochistic do you have to be to keep sending this guy money? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=203.76s)]
*  Look, thanks for having me back, Tucker. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=208.88s)]
*  It's an honor. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=211.64s)]
*  We talked previously about how corrupt Ukraine is, and I've met with a lot of these oligarchs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=212.98s)]
*  Their only allegiance is to themselves and their power and their wealth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=218.6s)]
*  They have no allegiance to the people of Ukraine, kind of like our oligarch class right now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=221.26s)]
*  So this is, as you said, a huge scam. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, I know that all this money we're sending over there is not getting to where [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=229.17999999999998s)]
*  it's supposed to go. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  This recent plane crash in Greece with a Ukrainian cargo plane with eight Ukrainian crew members [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  who all died and perished because the plane was loaded with explosives and weapons. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=241.32s)]
*  The narrative was it was coming from Serbia to Bangladesh, but I find that extremely hard [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=247.42s)]
*  to believe. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  What I think is happening is that the weapons are getting sold, and this is just a big grift [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  for either the oligarch class, the defense contractors in the U.S., or maybe Biden is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=258.5s)]
*  sending weapons somewhere. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=264.0s)]
*  I don't know, but it's not, this money is not getting to where we think it's going. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  That is for sure. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=269.82s)]
*  I don't understand how any responsible person could send billions in advanced weapons systems [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=271.42s)]
*  into a war zone and then make no effort to track what happens to them next. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=277.82s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is the huge, the big problem, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=283.26s)]
*  I mean, this is, as I've said before on your show, a safe space for criminals to do whatever [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  they want. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  They want no accountability, and they have either pushed too far, and because they're [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  now losing this war, and it doesn't matter how many weapons we send down, unless we send [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=298.5s)]
*  the U.S. military in there, I don't believe Ukraine can win this conflict in any sense [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=302.94s)]
*  of victory that we would see. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=307.5s)]
*  I think there needs to be some kind of immediate negotiated settlement because the Ukrainian [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=309.26s)]
*  people are suffering. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=313.46s)]
*  But either they have pushed too far, and now they're getting the push back from the Russian [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=315.14s)]
*  Federation, which is coming in massive waves, or they want a war with Ukraine, which is [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=319.62s)]
*  what I fear, and why we need adult leadership in the White House. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=324.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=326.86s)]
*  Everyone in Washington fell for this, just like they fell for the George Floyd myth, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=327.90000000000003s)]
*  just like they fell for all the COVID lies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  It's like dumber people have never run a country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=332.62s)]
*  Todd Wood, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=334.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  Anytime. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ71dJ4quY&t=338.78000000000003s)]
