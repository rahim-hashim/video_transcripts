# Vince Everett Ellison: An insane asylum has taken over the Democratic party
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU)
*  So let's say you open the borders to your country and let in seven million new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=0.0s)]
*  people who had no connection to America whatsoever. Didn't speak the language, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=4.26s)]
*  weren't from here, here legally, but you did that. That would make the society [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=8.24s)]
*  less cohesive than ever. And then you so mismanaged the economy that it was on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=11.76s)]
*  the way into recession. That's the last moment you would want to make Americans [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=16.12s)]
*  hate each other on the basis of race because if you did that the whole thing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  could just blow up. That's too crazy and reckless. That's exactly what the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=25.32s)]
*  current administration, Joe Biden's administration, is doing. Here's Joe [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=29.76s)]
*  Biden. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Innocent men, women, children hung by noose from trees, bodies burned, drowned, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  castrated, lynched for simply being black. Nothing more. Hard to believe but [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=42.02s)]
*  that's what was done and some people still want to do that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=47.72s)]
*  Some people still want to do that. Who are those people exactly? Vince Everett [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=51.84s)]
*  Ellison is producer of Will You Go To Hell For Me, an amazing documentary he has [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=56.76s)]
*  made that we showed you earlier and joins us tonight. Vince, thanks so much for [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=60.4s)]
*  coming on. Some people still want to do that. Who is the president talking about? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=62.92s)]
*  Who are these would-be lynchers? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=66.2s)]
*  He's probably talking about Democrats because they were the ones doing it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=68.16s)]
*  before. When we look back over history, the Democratic Party were the ones doing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=73.28s)]
*  Jim Crow that was lynching and killing and castrating black men and they're [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=77.36s)]
*  still doing it now. You go into any inner city in America, the Democrats run it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=80.44s)]
*  I mean it's a freak show, man. You got Lori Lightfoot and Pete Buttigieg and that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=85.64s)]
*  crazy Sam Brinkman guy, a Britten guy that was running around putting women's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  clothes on. I mean that's just who they are. It's an insane asylum now that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=95.44s)]
*  taking over the Democratic Party and we have to just start calling it exactly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=100.8s)]
*  what it is. The Democratic Party heaven is an American hell. It is no doubt. You [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=105.88s)]
*  go to any big city and you see dysfunction. You've seen that they've [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  released this hip-hop culture and they've destroyed every institution that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=117.44s)]
*  protected the children from these bad things and now the N-word, the B-word, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=120.56s)]
*  the W-word is being sung by these artists and they're elevated. They go to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=125.56s)]
*  the White House and the Super Bowl now. So how can these young men and young [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=132.52s)]
*  women not believe that they're not that? So you got Lori Lightfoot, you got Joe [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=135.88s)]
*  Biden running for reelection. They should be apologizing, forever been in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=140.12s)]
*  office. They're the worst president and the worst man in history. Lori Lightfoot [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  has presided over a dystopia. Every weekend we look at how many children are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=149.84s)]
*  dying in Chicago. We look at what Joe Biden has done. I mean what are they going to run on? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=156.56s)]
*  We want to sexually groom your children. We want to have grown men go to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=161.84s)]
*  the bathroom with your daughters. We're going to keep your children locked in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=169.08s)]
*  failing schools. We want to let fentanyl come across the border. That's what [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=173.12s)]
*  that's the only thing they can run on. So what do they say? They hate you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=176.44000000000003s)]
*  because you're black and we can protect you. Well look, C.S. Lewis said hell is a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=180.12s)]
*  choice and it is but you can un-choose it. They talk about systemic racism and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  and institutional racism. Well if it is an institutional racism they are the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  ones that provide it because they run all the institutions in the black [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=197.48s)]
*  community. They run the schools, they run the churches, they destroy them all. Yeah [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  it's institutional racism caused by them. They talk about white privilege. Well [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  let me tell you something. It is privileged to be white and it's also a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=211.0s)]
*  privilege to be black. It's a privilege to me to live in America. It's a privilege [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=214.56s)]
*  to me to be a Christian and for the Christians in the ghetto let me tell [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=219.44s)]
*  y'all. You can come above this. You're an heir of Jesus Christ. You're a son [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=222.76s)]
*  of God. Nobody can oppress you. Nobody is better than you. There's no racism that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=227.08s)]
*  can hold you down. Stand up, look at these people in the eye and tell them who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  you are. You are an American. You're strong, you're resilient and you'll get [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  through this. Amen. Ignore what they say, watch what they do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drtte-G2kPU&t=240.88000000000002s)]
