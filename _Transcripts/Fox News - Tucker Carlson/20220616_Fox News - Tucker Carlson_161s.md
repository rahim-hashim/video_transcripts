# Tucker Carlson: Here's why Democrats are 'thrilled' Americans are suffering
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98)
*  As the American standard of living plummets from spiking energy costs as the dream dies, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=0.0s)]
*  the reaction of our leaders to this catastrophe has been highly revealing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  A lot of them seem, what's the word, thrilled by the fact that Americans are suffering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=8.86s)]
*  And they are excited. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=13.84s)]
*  They're not bothering to hide it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=14.84s)]
*  And they're excited because finally, with no vote in Congress, they're going to get [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=15.84s)]
*  their Green New Deal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=19.64s)]
*  They're going to get it by default. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=20.64s)]
*  Now that you can no longer afford to drive your car or heat your house, you're going [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=21.64s)]
*  to be forced to switch to what they're calling renewable energy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=24.68s)]
*  This is the biggest possible change. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=28.48s)]
*  Out with the old United States of America, in with the new. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=29.92s)]
*  Leaders think it's pretty exciting, as well as, of course, highly lucrative for them and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=33.44s)]
*  their donors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=36.08s)]
*  But, wait a second, you may be wondering. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=37.08s)]
*  Can we trust these people to develop and build an entirely new energy grid to run Western [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  civilization? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=45.92s)]
*  Do they actually know anything about energy? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=46.92s)]
*  Do they understand how our current power grid works? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Can they fix a go-kart? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Can they operate a leaf blower? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Do these people have any skills at all, apart from running corporate HR departments and giving [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Ted talks? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=58.44s)]
*  Those are fair questions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=59.8s)]
*  To answer that, you might consider what has happened in Europe since the neoliberal seized [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=61.4s)]
*  control of the energy grid there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=65.12s)]
*  Wall Street Journal piece from last fall pretty much sums it up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=67.48s)]
*  Quote, energy prices in Europe hit records after wind stops blowing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=70.88s)]
*  That's the headline. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  It turns out that windmills need wind in order to produce electricity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=77.62s)]
*  On a calm day, the blades stop turning and the lights go out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=82.74s)]
*  You may have already known that, but the green energy people were completely shocked to see it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=86.64s)]
*  It took a lot of people by surprise, said one economist quoted in the paper. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=91.24s)]
*  If this were to happen in winter, we've got significantly higher demand, then that presents [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=95.2s)]
*  a real issue for system stability. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=99.12s)]
*  So clearly we have a significant design flaw here, but this is 2022, so it's hardly insurmountable. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=102.56s)]
*  You can just trust the science. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=108.2s)]
*  The most obvious solution is to place enormous diesel-powered fans in front of the windmills. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=109.7s)]
*  That way wind farms will never be without wind and we will never be without electricity. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=116.0s)]
*  Pretty clever. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=120.04s)]
*  Sandy Cortez likes that idea. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=121.04s)]
*  But Joe Biden is thinking bigger than that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=123.04s)]
*  Biden plans to issue an executive order commanding the wind to blow. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=125.12s)]
*  Now we already know that our elected officials are in charge of the weather. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=129.16s)]
*  That's the entire premise behind the Green New Deal. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=132.04s)]
*  Vote for us and we'll change the weather. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=134.8s)]
*  So why not take it one further step? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=136.08s)]
*  Americans want common sense weather control. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=138.96s)]
*  From now on, per Joe Biden's order, it will be windy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=142.08s)]
*  Come on man, we're bringing that press conference live when he gives it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfhYCbrM98&t=145.0s)]
