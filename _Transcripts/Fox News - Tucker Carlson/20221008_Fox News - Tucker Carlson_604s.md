# Ye talks about his spirituality
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo)
*  As we asked any question about virtually anything, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=0.0s)]
*  and the conversation moves back to his faith in God, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=3.0s)]
*  which is clearly foundational [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=6.3s)]
*  and is driving his transformation from a pop star [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=7.68s)]
*  to what he hopes to become, which is a spiritual leader. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=10.98s)]
*  He explained it in this clip. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=13.98s)]
*  What's your prayer life like? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=17.62s)]
*  Do you pray a lot? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=20.68s)]
*  This is a prayer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=22.48s)]
*  We're in constant prayer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=25.12s)]
*  I thought Hail Mary came to me, not in a Catholic way, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=26.82s)]
*  but more like in a toothpock way, like, come with me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=30.22s)]
*  Hail Mary, I'm gonna run quick see. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=34.22s)]
*  What do we have here now? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=36.42s)]
*  Do you wanna ride or die? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=38.26s)]
*  Na, na, na, na, na, na. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=40.46s)]
*  Have you ever heard that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=42.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=43.1s)]
*  It's like a Negro spiritual. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=43.94s)]
*  It's a chant. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=45.74s)]
*  It is, you know, it puts you in that mode. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=47.7s)]
*  I got a song that I made. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  It was like a mix. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=54.14s)]
*  It was a hybrid of that and Led Zeppelin. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=54.98s)]
*  And it went, it goes, it's like my best song. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=58.48s)]
*  La, la, la, la, wait till I get my money right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=60.98s)]
*  La, la, la, la, then you can't tell me nothing right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  And people, I mean, I can open up this stuff. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=73.62s)]
*  I can open up tours with this song. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=77.02s)]
*  I wanted to point out this hybrid. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=80.5s)]
*  I wanted to point out this hybrid. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=82.89999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like, if you see Zombie 1, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=84.1s)]
*  Zombie Land 1 and Zombie Land 2, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  or Terminator or anything, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  they always make the characters a little bit badder [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  in the next generations, next generation, next generation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=94.78s)]
*  So that's, you know, Kim is like a hybrid. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=97.72s)]
*  She's not just Marilyn Monroe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  You know, she's also, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=105.72s)]
*  she's also a fashion person. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=109.52s)]
*  She's also a mom. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=111.74s)]
*  She's also an activist. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=113.78s)]
*  She's a lawyer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=116.78s)]
*  She's a multi-billionaire. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=118.44s)]
*  She's hot. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=120.82s)]
*  She's one of the most beautiful people of all time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=122.12s)]
*  You know, this is a different level [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=123.98s)]
*  of a video game character now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=129.96s)]
*  And when you see a headline that says, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=133.0s)]
*  Kim says, oh, I'm gonna stay single forever, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=134.7s)]
*  that's the indoctrination. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=139.14s)]
*  Like, because they want this person [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  to tell all the little girls out there [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=145.92s)]
*  that they need to be single forever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, all moms, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  I know there's definitely people who watch this show. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Do you think that's, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  so you don't think that's an organic, natural thing? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=157.7s)]
*  I mean, that is a message that she is being used to send. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=159.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=162.54s)]
*  Think about the song, Don't Talk About Bruin. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, which already sounds weird. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  Like it's, you know, talking about like an uncle [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=167.38s)]
*  or something that did something wrong. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=169.94s)]
*  I don't know if they say don't talk about Bruno, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=171.9s)]
*  But in the song, listen to the lyrics. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=173.4s)]
*  It says, the man of my dreams will be slightly out my reach. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=176.26s)]
*  And I just see my kids running around [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=180.3s)]
*  and I see these things, but you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=183.7s)]
*  the thing about, you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=187.88s)]
*  hey, got for the execs at Disney [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=189.38s)]
*  that are studying everything I'm doing or saying, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=190.82s)]
*  trying to figure out how to connect with 15 year olds. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=192.72s)]
*  And that's why Bernard, I know, you know, by Supreme. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=195.22s)]
*  And instead of putting a true skater designer, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  they put like a BLM manager as the head of Supreme [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=203.76s)]
*  because Supreme has an impact with the 15 year olds. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=207.26s)]
*  For the Disney guys, you know, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  you might not believe in God, but God believes in you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=218.94s)]
*  It's not a battle you can win. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=221.94s)]
*  It's like, don't jump Anakin, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=224.7s)]
*  you're gonna have the higher ground kind of situation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=226.52s)]
*  So you could put out all of the indoctrinations [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=230.12s)]
*  and, you know, moves and have the biggest media company, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=234.5s)]
*  but why am I alive? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  Why am I protected? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=244.28s)]
*  Why did I become the richest black man of all time? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  Like, how did that happen? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=249.68s)]
*  And the more and more I lean into God and work for God, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=252.18s)]
*  the more wins God is gonna bestow on our team, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  on Jesus gang. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=261.3s)]
*  And for me to go out and just state an obvious [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=263.04s)]
*  and empathetic statement in the middle of the most liberal, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=269.1s)]
*  central, like to go, that was like TNM in square. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  So I was like, with Candace Owens, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=276.82s)]
*  and we both wore the shirt at the same time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=280.82s)]
*  You know, we got some Jesus soldiers out here [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=284.68s)]
*  and people say they're willing to die for it, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=288.92s)]
*  but we live for it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=292.02s)]
*  We're living for the battle. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=293.56s)]
*  And what's the battle for? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=296.36s)]
*  Life itself, our children, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=297.4s)]
*  they're killing us through the food. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=299.84s)]
*  They're killing us through the content. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=302.68s)]
*  They're killing us through the programming, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=305.2s)]
*  but God is alive and is alive in all of us [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=308.68s)]
*  and we will overcome. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=311.2s)]
*  It sounds like you're hopeful [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=313.64s)]
*  for the future of the country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=314.72s)]
*  Absolutely, because I have the vision for it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=317.42s)]
*  I understand the ecosystem. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=320.38s)]
*  I understand how to even liberate a big pharma. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=323.02s)]
*  I have solutions for the future. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=329.2s)]
*  I don't have the entire vision. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, certain things are just in front of me [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=335.18s)]
*  and they happen when they're supposed to happen, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  but there's so many open doors, like, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  we have this concept, I was been, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  this has put on my heart, the idea of a monastery, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  or I call it the Dondastery, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  which takes the different disciplines [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  and blends them together. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=356.04s)]
*  And in the Dondastery, we have proper baby healthcare. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=358.0s)]
*  And I'm sure there's a higher, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=365.72s)]
*  actually when I met with Gabby, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=367.82000000000005s)]
*  she had a really, really good term for this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=368.98s)]
*  And [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=372.48s)]
*  so many people bring their babies to the hospital, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=376.86s)]
*  not just black people, and the doctors mess up. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=381.06s)]
*  And they're like, oh, there's been some complications. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=385.5s)]
*  So to be able to have incredible nurses [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=388.5s)]
*  I was very specific about saying nurses [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=395.92s)]
*  instead of saying doctor too. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=397.82000000000005s)]
*  I don't believe you need a doctor, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=401.32000000000005s)]
*  and I'm not a doctor, but a nurse. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=404.48s)]
*  It's possible, you know, to have a successful childbirth. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=411.12s)]
*  And so that's the first thing we provide, shelter. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=418.0s)]
*  We won't turn anyone away. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  Food, clothing, high-end curriculum, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=422.76s)]
*  and vocational curriculum, farming, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=427.28s)]
*  carpentry, automotive, computer, software, and hardware. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  So it becomes a new place for you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=436.68s)]
*  Someone can lay the baby on their steps and say, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=439.08s)]
*  hey, the situation I'm in, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=442.2s)]
*  I don't have enough money for another kid. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=445.2s)]
*  I don't have the time. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=448.96s)]
*  I don't have the room in my house. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=450.52s)]
*  I just don't have the resources. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=451.92s)]
*  And every day for the past two months [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=453.92s)]
*  I've been walking by this Planned Parenthood [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=458.72s)]
*  and I'm thinking about stopping in [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  because I just can't have this baby. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=462.32s)]
*  And what I'm doing is saying, hey, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  well let's put a place just across the street [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=468.72s)]
*  from the Planned Parenthoods and say, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  this is a place that if you, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=474.70000000000005s)]
*  when you decide to have your child, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=478.72s)]
*  this child can have the best opportunity at life. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=482.12s)]
*  Do you think this society discourages parental involvement, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=486.12s)]
*  parental influence over the children? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=490.32s)]
*  I mean, society is like a big term. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=494.88s)]
*  You mean- It is. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=496.98s)]
*  Well, you had said that your father was discouraged [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=498.34000000000003s)]
*  from being in your household [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  and you have been discouraged [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=503.64s)]
*  from being in your children's lives. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=504.72s)]
*  Do you think this is a thing that happens [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=507.72s)]
*  to a lot of people in America, to a lot of men? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=509.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=513.58s)]
*  And a lot of men deal with a mother [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=514.88s)]
*  and the baby mama [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=518.64s)]
*  and the mother-in-law ganging up to take the child away [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  and not wanting to give the dad his say so. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  Like there was even a moment where we were arguing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=534.08s)]
*  about Norf's basketball coach. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=538.38s)]
*  And I had to say like, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=542.54s)]
*  I went from not making a basketball team in eighth grade [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=547.42s)]
*  to winning championships in ninth grade [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=551.54s)]
*  by practicing every day. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=554.02s)]
*  And Norf likes to basketball [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=555.86s)]
*  and I'm gonna come and practice with her every day. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=557.34s)]
*  I'm also gonna pick the other coaches that work with her. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=559.82s)]
*  And now that she's back, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=563.1s)]
*  playing basketball, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=566.16s)]
*  this is the most confident person in the league. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  She's like the Dennis Rodman. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=570.32s)]
*  And when Norf snatches the ball out of a girl twice her size [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=574.08s)]
*  and she comes over to the side, I tell her, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=579.96s)]
*  don't let anyone take anything from you ever. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=582.12s)]
*  Don't let anyone take anything from our family. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=586.26s)]
*  Don't let anyone take our company. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=588.78s)]
*  Always protect your brothers and sisters. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=591.16s)]
*  And we're gonna be back on the YouTube channel [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=595.36s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAvEv8gTmVo&t=596.92s)]
