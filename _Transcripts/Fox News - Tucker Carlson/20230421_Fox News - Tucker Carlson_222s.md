# Tucker: Where are the '+' people?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08)
*  That was the President of the United States, senile, stumbling as always in this case over the latest acronym for the pronoun people for the record [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=0.0s)]
*  It's called [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=7.22s)]
*  LGBTQIA [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=8.34s)]
*  plus [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=10.34s)]
*  Plus you see the plus mark all over the place now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  We went shopping for Mother's Day cards today at a Rite Aid and saw an entire category for LGBTQIA plus cards [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  And it got us wondering who's in the plus category. Are we in the plus category? We feel like we're a net addition [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=22.2s)]
*  We're the plus people any plus person out there is always welcome to come on this show and explain [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=28.38s)]
*  What's so plus about you? But in the meantime Chadwick Moore of the spectator has thought a lot about this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=34.6s)]
*  We thought we would speak to him about it tonight. Thanks so much for coming on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=40.26s)]
*  So who's who's in the plot? And look, I don't want to make this personal [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to get my feelings hurt. But do I qualify in the plus category and if not me who? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=48.34s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=53.42s)]
*  You absolutely 100% do I mean it's unfortunate you've been lobbying big gay for a long time. Yes. Welcome to the community Tucker [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=56.0s)]
*  Big gay for a long time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=64.94s)]
*  To get an S to the alphabet, you know, we should have an S in there for straight people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=68.18s)]
*  But of course, they won't let us have that for some reason. But thankfully we have the plus [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=72.08s)]
*  It really you know what they pretend to be so inclusive and yet here they are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=76.9s)]
*  Excluding 96% of the population [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=81.62s)]
*  You know, but they hide it in that plus so you can hide there in the plus somewhere down the alphabet [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=84.14s)]
*  It kind of signifies that much like the struggle for justice and equality itself [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=88.7s)]
*  The alphabet people are kind of nebulous and extend into perpetuity [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=92.94s)]
*  They're kind of undefine able and that is what the plus is for anyone can be [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=97.72s)]
*  Can I just ask and I think you told me once you've been banned from gay bars since you started coming on this show [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=102.1s)]
*  So maybe you haven't had the experience recently [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=107.02s)]
*  But like what was the last time you're in a bar and someone comes that I'm part of the I'm up [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=108.94s)]
*  I'm the plus and I'm the fabled one the Loch Ness Monster [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=112.12s)]
*  I'm the thumb the plus you hear about but have never seen has anyone ever said that to you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=115.56s)]
*  Yeah, where the minuses to like ham a plus or a minus well, let me get together tonight, you know [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=120.54s)]
*  for the charge I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=126.26s)]
*  Think we need to start going around and asking people if their pluses exactly, you know [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=128.7s)]
*  One thing it's funny too is like the Q nobody really knows what the Q stands for. I don't either I [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=132.26s)]
*  We're no one knows what it is. No one knows what it is. Is that really true? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I guess we're not you're not allowed to ask questions [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=142.72s)]
*  You just have to sort of not be like you I plus but what a sincere question is someone who I think still lives in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  Brooklyn like is there a real definition for that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what my definition of queer is essentially there's two types of queers [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=154.56s)]
*  There's the sort of run-of-the-mill gay man who lives in Brooklyn [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=158.76s)]
*  You can probably spot him by having like a dangly earring and some really bad eyewear [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=162.76s)]
*  And he calls himself queer because he wants to be special. He wants to think he's unique [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=167.56s)]
*  That's the first type of queer [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=171.84s)]
*  The second type of queer is really just a straight woman who wants to add a little pizzazz to herself [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=173.24s)]
*  So so, you know, she thinks she's boring. She thinks she's basic. She may has like some gay friends [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=177.96s)]
*  she maybe once like kiss the girl in college so she can now call herself queer or [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=183.4s)]
*  Somewhere in the pluses but queer has been quite quite helpful for for many people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=188.16s)]
*  You know queer kind of does the job of the plus anyway, to be honest [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=194.56s)]
*  Not my world but absolutely fascinating and as a believer in precision in language [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=199.0s)]
*  I am so grateful that you helped us define that tonight Chadwick more. Thank you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGqoqsCd08&t=203.94s)]
