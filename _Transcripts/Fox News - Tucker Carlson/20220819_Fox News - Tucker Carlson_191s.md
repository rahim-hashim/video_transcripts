# Miller on GOP candidates avoiding immigration, crime: Push messages where there is 'nowhere to hide'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE)
*  Stephen Miller has been following this since the beginning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a former senior White House advisor. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=2.12s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=3.84s)]
*  Stephen Miller, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=5.04s)]
*  This seems like the simplest formula ever. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=6.68s)]
*  Every normal person hates crime. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=8.72s)]
*  You'd really have to be Kamala Harris to want more crime. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=10.28s)]
*  Why aren't they running on this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=12.56s)]
*  They're not running on it for the reasons you identified. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=14.48s)]
*  Joe Biden is the most unpopular president [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=17.36s)]
*  in American history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=19.44s)]
*  We should be looking at the largest midterm victory [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=20.48s)]
*  for Republicans likewise in American history. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=23.42s)]
*  And instead the forecasts are shrinking every single day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=25.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=29.68s)]
*  Because Mitch McConnell isn't interested [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=30.48s)]
*  in running a national referendum that says, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=32.24s)]
*  elect Republicans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  And in January, we seal the border, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=36.24s)]
*  we reform law enforcement to go after criminals, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=39.4s)]
*  not Republicans, and we end the war on America's children. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=42.18s)]
*  Now what he wants to do is handpick candidates [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=45.88s)]
*  that he thinks will like Mitch and Mitch will like them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  And if that means we have 48 seats or we have 49 seats, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=51.0s)]
*  so be it, he gets to stay on as majority leader. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=53.68s)]
*  We are witnessing in real time [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=57.12s)]
*  the greatest self-inflicted wound we have ever seen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  If Republicans went out every day and said, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  we have had more illegal immigrants ever before this year [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=66.2s)]
*  than had been recorded in world history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=69.42s)]
*  We have increases in crime in our cities [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  that no civilized nation has ever seen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=74.94s)]
*  And if you elect a Republican majority, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  we will go in in January [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=80.44s)]
*  and we will take the first funding bill [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=82.64s)]
*  and we will attach to it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=84.44s)]
*  a requirement to border be shut [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=85.76s)]
*  and a requirement that the FBI stop attacking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=88.12s)]
*  their opponents and start locking up [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=91.04s)]
*  and breaking apart organized crime in America. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=93.2s)]
*  And you say that in every state [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  and in every congressional district in this country, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=97.48s)]
*  and you will win a landslide like you have never seen before, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=99.68s)]
*  but nobody wants to step up and even make that promise. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=102.84s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  And actually there's precedent for it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=106.64s)]
*  The largest landslide in the history [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  of the American presidency was 1972 [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  by a candidate who did not win on charm, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=112.68s)]
*  but won on one order. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=115.04s)]
*  And you can mock Richard Nixon all you want, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=117.12s)]
*  but he was right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=118.84s)]
*  49 states. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  So again, how dumb are the people who run the party? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=122.04s)]
*  Well, a lot of people have been drinking [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  the Franklin's Kool-Aid. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=128.0s)]
*  I was a congressional staffer for almost a decade. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=129.56s)]
*  I went to all of these presentations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=131.76s)]
*  So what they do is they sit you down and they say, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=134.08s)]
*  well, we ran a message and it says [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=136.6s)]
*  that controlling wasteful Washington spending pulls at 95%. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=138.70000000000002s)]
*  To which I would say, you would else pulls at 95%. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=143.08s)]
*  I like cotton candy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  I think airplanes are really neat and super cool, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=147.4s)]
*  but I enjoy watching movies on Sunday. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=150.28s)]
*  None of that gets anybody elected. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  What gets people elected is pushing messages [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=154.68s)]
*  where there's nowhere to hide. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=157.36s)]
*  I'm for putting violent criminals behind bars. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=158.8s)]
*  I'm for deporting illegal aliens, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  and you're not, so I win and you lose. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=162.52s)]
*  That's how you win elections. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=164.44s)]
*  And how about Rafael Warnock? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  Why don't you explain that video [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=167.12s)]
*  where you seem to be committing spousal abuse? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Like, why is that the memory hole? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=170.56s)]
*  That guy's a US Senator. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=172.04s)]
*  I thought we were against that stuff. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe he'll come on and explain it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Fight to win. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=176.04s)]
*  Stephen Miller, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70-QBV6FoE&t=177.48s)]
