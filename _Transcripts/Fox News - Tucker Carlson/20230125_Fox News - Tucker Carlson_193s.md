# Tucker: Abysmal failure is always rewarded
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I)
*  So they're abandoning ship over to the White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=0.0s)]
*  because Biden has been undone by his own party. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=2.2s)]
*  And the clearest sign is that Ron Klain, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  White House Chief of Staff, the guy who runs everything, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  has said he's out of there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=9.36s)]
*  What's interesting, of course, he's running away. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  He'll have some other high-paying job. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  He'll be denouncing Biden within the year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=14.64s)]
*  What's interesting is who's replacing him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=17.2s)]
*  And, of course, the rule in this administration [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=18.84s)]
*  is you have to pick someone with a track record [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=20.88s)]
*  of abysmal failure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=23.68s)]
*  So the industry say they're picking the COVID czar, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=25.48s)]
*  Jeff Zients. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=28.24s)]
*  In case you've forgotten here, some of his greatest hits. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=30.2s)]
*  It important strides on equity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=33.28s)]
*  with the majority of booster shots [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=35.76s)]
*  going to people of color. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=37.44s)]
*  This virus knows no borders, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=38.68s)]
*  and it's in our national interest to vaccinate the world. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  Bottom line, vaccination requirements work. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  For the unvaccinated, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=46.16s)]
*  you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=48.64s)]
*  For yourselves, your families, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=54.4s)]
*  So the guy is humiliating. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=57.28s)]
*  It turned out to be completely wrong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Jeff Zients had no background whatsoever in medicine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=61.44s)]
*  He had no idea what he was talking about, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=63.76s)]
*  and he never apologized for it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=66.36s)]
*  So he's getting an upgrade. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=67.72s)]
*  He's now what else, chief of staff. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=68.92s)]
*  But what's interesting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=69.92s)]
*  is that Jeff Zients also got super, super rich. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=71.72s)]
*  Now, how did a guy like that get so rich? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=74.6s)]
*  Well, in just one year, 2020, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=76.28s)]
*  Zients made between $10 and $28 million. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=78.68s)]
*  In one year, the COVID year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=83.88s)]
*  What? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=87.4s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=88.72s)]
*  Sean Davis is the CEO of The Federalist. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=89.56s)]
*  He joins us tonight with possibly some answers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=90.92s)]
*  Sean, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=93.72s)]
*  So always the story is, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  how are these people getting so rich? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=96.44s)]
*  No one ever asked that question. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=97.88s)]
*  Jeff Zients has gotten richer than almost anybody. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=99.84s)]
*  How do you think that happened? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=101.44s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  I think especially through the COVID thing, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=104.8s)]
*  it was a story we saw all over the country [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=107.12s)]
*  where I know it's cliche, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=109.92s)]
*  but the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=111.6s)]
*  And Zients seems to have used much of his career. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=114.0s)]
*  Recall, he used to be the Obamacare czar. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=117.36s)]
*  He oversaw Obamacare's implementation, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  which was also a government means of enriching [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=122.6s)]
*  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=126.16s)]
*  at the expense of the rest of us. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  So really, I think his COVID stint [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=129.24s)]
*  was just the remix of his original Obamacare album. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=131.12s)]
*  So federal employees have financial disclosure forms [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  that the rest of us can see. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=138.24s)]
*  Always the story is who's making money on these policies [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=140.0s)]
*  that don't help the public. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=143.32s)]
*  So COVID, Ukraine, that's the one story [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=144.32s)]
*  the Washington Post never writes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=147.52s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=148.72s)]
*  Well, I think we know the answer [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=150.8s)]
*  is because Bezos somehow got even richer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=152.04s)]
*  One of the richest people on earth got richer [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=154.4s)]
*  during the COVID era. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=156.64s)]
*  But my favorite excerpt [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=157.84s)]
*  from the Zients financial disclosure, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=159.16s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  you can go look at it at the White House website, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=161.88s)]
*  he had up to $5 million in gold bars listed on there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=163.72s)]
*  So he's a real man of the people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=167.24s)]
*  Well, he's got a lot of confidence in the US dollar, I see. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=169.84s)]
*  The government that he runs issuing this paper [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  is not worth anything. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=175.24s)]
*  He's buying gold. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=176.32s)]
*  Ignore what they say, watch what they do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=178.56s)]
*  Sean Davis, thank you for that detail. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  It's great to see you tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx1lrR3v5I&t=181.32s)]
