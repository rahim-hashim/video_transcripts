# Tucker: Words have no meaning in Washington
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=0.0s)]
*  As you people say, the federal government seems big, maybe bigger than ever. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=2.0s)]
*  Well, it actually is the largest employer in the world, the federal government. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=4.8s)]
*  Nothing else comes close. Not Google, not Amazon, not the Communist Party of China. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=8.64s)]
*  Nothing. How many people work for the United States government? Let's put it this way. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  There are more than a hundred countries around the world whose total populations, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=17.92s)]
*  that is every man, woman and child, are smaller than our federal workforce. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=22.0s)]
*  Entire countries, many of them. The U.S. government, in other words, is astoundingly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=27.04s)]
*  large, world historically big, scale without precedent, truly gargantuan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=32.64s)]
*  So what do all those people who work there do every day? You may be wondering that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=38.4s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. Actually, nobody's really sure, including many of the employees [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  themselves. Fundamentally, the federal government is a mystery. Like the universe, it goes on [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=47.28s)]
*  forever. It makes you feel small thinking about it, which is probably the point. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=52.64s)]
*  The good news is every once in a while, our government does something you can actually [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  understand. That happened recently when Joe Biden signed a $750 billion piece of legislation [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=60.88s)]
*  called the Inflation Reduction Act. What does the Inflation Reduction Act do? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=67.68s)]
*  Come on, what are you, slow? The answer is right there in the name. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=73.36s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act is an act that reduces inflation. It's an inflation reducing act. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=77.44s)]
*  And that's welcome news because inflation is indeed a problem. In fact, voters say it's the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=84.16s)]
*  problem they worry about most. So Congress has decided to reduce it. That's how things work in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=88.0s)]
*  Washington. You identify a crisis and then you pass a law making it illegal. Crisis solved. It's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=93.92s)]
*  simple. Getting too hot for you this summer? No problem. Just have Congress write a law banning [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=99.92s)]
*  high temperatures. It's effectively our climate change policy and as we know, it works. The science [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=105.04s)]
*  on that has been settled. Don't deny it. Now Congress has decided to bring that very same [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=110.4s)]
*  approach to inflation. Just command it to go down. You can imagine how terrified inflation will be [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=115.04s)]
*  when it discovers it's being reduced by our all-powerful Congress. Wait, it'll say in horror. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=121.12s)]
*  You passed an Inflation Reduction Act? Okay, fine. I surrender. Gas is now $1.50 a gallon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  Hamburgers, two bucks a pound. Sorry for the high prices. That's the promise of this act anyway. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=131.6s)]
*  But in real life, a lot of people are still wondering how is this going to work? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=138.0s)]
*  Hilary Vaughn from Fox was wondering that. So yesterday she caught up with Senator Joe [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=141.76s)]
*  Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin is the man, the single man whose vote made this bill possible. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=145.84s)]
*  Is the Inflation Reduction Act really going to reduce inflation? She asked. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's how Joe Manchin responded. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=156.32s)]
*  So as Hilary Vaughn pointed out correctly, the law won't immediately make anything [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=177.36s)]
*  cheaper to buy. In other words, it will not reduce inflation. But Joe Manchin didn't deny this. He [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=181.92s)]
*  didn't seem bothered by it. In fact, his response was, why would it? Well, let's see, because you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  told us it would, you dishonest little creep. And then you printed another $750 billion of fake money, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  which is exactly the habit that caused historic inflation in the first place, all this fake money [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  printing. So what's the upside of this bill exactly? Joe Manchin didn't say. Congressman Jamie Raskin [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  of Maryland couldn't explain it either. Watch this. I know that those who've been blaming [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=210.08s)]
*  President Biden for the inflation going up are now giving President Biden all the credit for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  inflation going down. So we're moving things in the right direction already. And what parts of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  bill do you think will quickly work on that specifically? Next question. I'm Jamie Raskin. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=223.68s)]
*  I'll say anything. What parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will actually reduce inflation? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  Next question, says Raskin. He actually said that out loud as you just saw. In other words, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=237.2s)]
*  you've caught me lying and I don't even care. Go away, peasant. So as it turns out, and we hate to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  break this to you, the Inflation Reduction Act may be a classic example of misinformation. Imagine [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  buying a bottle labeled shampoo and finding out the hard way it was actually drain cleaner. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=254.48s)]
*  It's like that. So if there's one thing we can learn from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=259.84s)]
*  it's that in Washington, words no longer have any meaning at all. The empire has officially entered [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=265.6s)]
*  its postmodern phase where there's no connection whatsoever between the sounds that emerge from [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  the mouths of our leaders and observable physical reality. Congress might as well have called this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=275.6s)]
*  the Eternal Happiness Act. And why not? That'll probably be the name of the next bill, Joe Biden [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=280.88s)]
*  signs. And we hope so because we are long overdue for Washington to ban sadness. They ought to get [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  on that. Not that this bill was even thought about by Joe Biden. Not that he even noticed this bill. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=290.48s)]
*  Biden doesn't get too caught up in the meaning of words these days. Biden is definitively [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=298.8s)]
*  post-literate at this point. Here's the scene as he signed his most recent legislative triumph. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  Here we go. It's now law. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=316.8s)]
*  Okay. Here we go. I might as well put a sign on his desk saying, this guy has no idea what he's doing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=318.24s)]
*  right now. Because he didn't and it couldn't have been more obvious. The thousand yard stare was the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=339.44s)]
*  giveaway. There were doughboys in Verdun who looked less shell shocked than Biden just did. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=343.76s)]
*  But the question remained, what was in the bill? Well, let's see. You'll be happy to know that this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=348.96s)]
*  bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, includes $3 billion for the US Postal Service to buy new [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=353.6s)]
*  electric mail trucks. So why would your mailman need an electric mail truck? No one has ever [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=358.24s)]
*  explained that, but your mailman is getting one. And China is getting even richer from the electric [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=364.16s)]
*  mail truck batteries, which it makes. So there's that. Then there's another $3 billion allocated [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=367.92s)]
*  to block grants for something called environmental justice. That'll be overseen by the EPA, which [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  used to look after the environment, but now it's in the justice business. Environmental justice [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=379.92s)]
*  gets about $60 billion in this new legislation, which is great if you're in the environmental [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=384.8s)]
*  justice business, but it leaves the rest of us wondering, what is environmental justice actually? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=389.92s)]
*  Well, according to the bill, it means, and we are quoting here, facilitating engagement of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=394.4s)]
*  disadvantaged communities in state and federal advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings, and other [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=398.96s)]
*  public processes. Okay, that sounds confusing, but also expensive. In all, the EPA alone gets [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=404.4s)]
*  more than $40 billion in this bill, including more than $30 billion for so-called disadvantaged [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  communities. What are those? Well, they're not really defined. People who vote for Joe Biden. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  So what it really means is the EPA is going to spread more identity politics and race hate. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  Are you sick of that yet? The Biden White House is not sick of it. They're all in. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=429.28s)]
*  For context, to show you just how all in they are on that, the total annual budget of the EPA [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=433.84s)]
*  currently stands at about $10 billion. So this is a lot of money flowing to equity and the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=440.08s)]
*  disadvantaged. And of course, everything hangs on definition. So who gets to define what [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=446.08s)]
*  disadvantage is, a disadvantaged community? Well, that would be the EPA's administrator, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=451.44s)]
*  a guy called Michael Regan. This is a guy who's in his late 40s, who has never had an actual job [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=456.8s)]
*  in his life. He's never worked for real business of any kind, but he does have priorities. And to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=462.0s)]
*  give you some sense of what they are, we'll tell you what he told The Daily Show this year. And [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=467.44s)]
*  we're quoting, everything I do at EPA is through the lens of environmental justice, contracting, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=471.76s)]
*  procurement, air quality, water quality, land management starts with, are we protecting the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=478.0s)]
*  least among us, those who have lacked political representation and those who have not been at the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=483.04s)]
*  table for decades? End quote. So really this is about spreading race hate as virtually everything [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=487.52s)]
*  they do is. They call it equity. It's not about protecting the environment. And if you're wondering [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=495.04s)]
*  how the environment's doing, take a very close look. Is anyone monitoring the chemicals in our water? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=500.72s)]
*  No. We're busy conducting workshops for billions of dollars with disadvantaged communities. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=506.64s)]
*  So that may not be helping the environment, but it's definitely not reducing inflation. Inflation [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=514.56s)]
*  reduction is not the same as protecting people who lack political representation. That's of course, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=521.04s)]
*  Joe Biden's base, the 81 million who voted for him. That's what this bill is really about, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=525.36s)]
*  rewarding his voters. That would include virtually every bureaucrat in Washington. They do very well [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=530.8s)]
*  in this bill, of course, as long as they promise to spend it on equity. However, they wanted to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=535.28s)]
*  find that there's $25 million for the government accountability office to determine, quote, whether [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=539.36s)]
*  the economic, social and environmental impacts of the funds described in this paragraph are equitable. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=543.92s)]
*  The bill also calls for 10 million to be spent on equity commissions within the department of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=550.16s)]
*  agriculture to combat racism. In other words, to commit racism. Really not since the German [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=554.24s)]
*  government 80 years ago has any government ever paid closer attention to people's genetics. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  That's true. And yet no one notices it for some reason. Well, we do. There's more than $2 billion [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  for the general services administration, something called the Federal Permitting Improvement [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=570.72s)]
*  Steering Council. That gets 350 million. The Bureau of Indian Affairs gets 220 million. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=574.8s)]
*  The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations gets 23 million. And it's not just bureaucrats who [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=579.68s)]
*  are getting paid. There are billions of dollars in new tax credits. Who do those go to? Joe Biden's [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=583.92s)]
*  donors. Of course, not to you. Are you in private equity? No, no, you're not. So you don't get [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=588.08s)]
*  anything. Biden described these credits yesterday. The Inflation Reduction Act invest $369 billion [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  to take the most aggressive action ever, ever, ever, ever in confronting the climate crisis [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=604.48s)]
*  and strengthening our economic, our energy security. It's going to offer working families [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  thousands of dollars in savings by providing them rebates to buy new and efficient appliances, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=616.16s)]
*  weatherize their homes, get tax credit for purchasing heat pumps and rooftop solar, electric stoves, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=621.28s)]
*  ovens, dryers. I'd like for a second. So you watch that and you realize maybe they are going to run [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  him again because he doesn't actually exist. He is merely a conduit through which they change [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=633.6s)]
*  America. He has no idea what he's saying. He reads the script. He seems kind of non-threatening and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=642.0s)]
*  out of it. That may seem embarrassing to you, a problem to you. You wonder, what does his wife [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=645.84s)]
*  think of all this? It's so demeaning and degrading. It's cruel to do this to a guy, feed him full of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  drugs and haven't read someone else's script. But if you're trying to change the country really fast, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=654.64s)]
*  this is very useful to you. So of course they're going to run him again. So again, to the bill, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=659.6s)]
*  a nonprofit called Rewiring America, which supports this bill, decided to figure out how much money [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=664.72s)]
*  Americans are eligible to receive from the Inflation Reduction Act based on zip code, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  household income, tax filing status. So according to Rewiring America, a married couple with one [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=674.24s)]
*  child in San Francisco, earning the median household income there of $120,000, would be [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=679.28s)]
*  eligible for nearly $12,000 in tax credits. But according to that same group, that same family [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=684.4s)]
*  of three making the median income in Youngstown, Ohio, for example, would be eligible for just [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=690.08s)]
*  $81 in tax credits. Ooh, that's weird. So the middle class gets shafted while people making 120 [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=694.96s)]
*  grand in San Francisco make out. Okay. So most Americans who are making middle class wages would [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=703.2s)]
*  be eligible for more savings only if they're willing to go out and spend thousands of dollars [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=712.48s)]
*  on things like a new heat pump water heater, an electric stove, or a heat pump clothes dryer. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=717.12s)]
*  Right. None of which work very well. But the bigger issue is that all these tax credits for Joe Biden's [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=722.6400000000001s)]
*  base are going to increase inflation. This is the same thing that happened to college tuition when [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=727.12s)]
*  the government subsidized it. It got much more expensive. Perfect. And that's already started. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=732.64s)]
*  As the Washington Examiner has reported, electric vehicle manufacturers are now raising the price of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=739.92s)]
*  their cars now that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act includes a $7,500 tax credit for [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=744.24s)]
*  electric vehicles. Quote, ahead of the Inflation Reduction Act extending the tax credit of up to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=750.8s)]
*  $7,500 for purchases of new electric and hybrid vehicles, Ford and GM announced price increases [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=755.76s)]
*  at similar rates. You following this? So the government pays you back your own money to buy [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=762.64s)]
*  a product and then the manufacturer of the product raises the cost of that same product by the same [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=769.68s)]
*  amount. Oh, so it's a subsidy for them, not savings for you. Last week, Ford announced price hikes [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=774.0s)]
*  between $6,000 and $8,500 for most of its lineup of its F-150 Lightning electric vehicles. Well, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  General Motors upped its electric Hummer costs by $6,250 last month. So what is that? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=786.08s)]
*  They don't want to answer the question because the only potentially deflationary aspect of this bill [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=795.36s)]
*  is the tax increase, which is of course probably not a good idea when you're in a recession. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  But our government is not willing to cut spending and stop printing money. So instead, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  their solution is to take money from you. This is classic, right? So you print all the money you [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=811.04s)]
*  want because you hold the reserve currency and then when inflation goes up, you just try and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=817.52s)]
*  pull it out of the system through taxation. That's modern monetary theory. Look it up. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this act will cost the middle class $20 billion [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=828.0s)]
*  a year in new taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded that under this bill, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  61% of taxpayers making between $40,000 and $50,000 will see a tax increase. 91% of Americans making [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=836.64s)]
*  between $75,000 and $100,000 will see their taxes go up and 97% of Americans making between $100,000 [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=842.8s)]
*  and $200,000 will see their taxes go up. So if you're making $100,000 in Arlington, Virginia, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=847.6s)]
*  are you rich? Oh no, you're barely scraping by. So it turns out that Biden was lying. Just yesterday, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=853.28s)]
*  he told us that no one making under $400,000 a year will see their taxes go up. Watch. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=860.72s)]
*  And I'm keeping my campaign commitment. No one, let me emphasize, no one earning less than $400,000 [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes. Folks. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, not a penny more. I mean, again, you can't blame the guy. He's just a mannequin. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=883.6s)]
*  But whoever wrote that knew he was lying. There is one group of Americans who will not pay more [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=888.0s)]
*  under that bill. That's Biden's donors, the richest people in the country. Thanks to the Democratic [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=892.16s)]
*  Party's hedge fund support, and they have a lot of that in the private equity world, the final revision [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=897.68s)]
*  of this bill keeps the carried interest loophole in our tax code. That means that people who work [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=903.28s)]
*  in finance, many parts of finance, are able to report their income as interest and pay half the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  taxes that you do. No one can defend this policy. It is indefensible. Even the people who benefit [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=917.84s)]
*  from it will not defend it. They're embarrassed of it. They take advantage of it, of course, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=925.6s)]
*  but it's a scam and everybody knows it. And yet it remains in our tax code because they paid off [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=928.96s)]
*  the Democratic Senator from Arizona and a bunch of others. So just in case the message wasn't clear, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=933.6s)]
*  the bill gives the IRS another $80 billion to hire 87,000 new auditors. So what are those new [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=939.6s)]
*  auditors, those armed auditors at the IRS, have to do with a tax code this unfair? Well, the truth [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=946.96s)]
*  is if you have a tax code this unfair and it keeps getting more unfair every year, you have to hire [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  armed goons to make people obey because they won't otherwise. 87,000 new armed IRS agents. How many is [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  that? Well, for perspective, the IRS currently has about 78,000 total. So this bill will make the IRS [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  larger than the army of the nation of Italy, also the nation of the Philippines, also the UK. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=976.4s)]
*  What? Thanks, Joe Manchin. So what are those agents going to be doing? Well, we're not sure, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=983.52s)]
*  but we do have an IRS training video for you. Watch. In addition to being accountants, we're also [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=988.64s)]
*  law enforcement officers, which is very interesting because a lot of the special [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=994.24s)]
*  agents that work for the IRS, they don't come from a law enforcement background. We get to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=998.0s)]
*  do the same things like all the other law enforcement officers do. Things happen. We [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1002.56s)]
*  have to be able to respond. So we have to be ready. So we teach our agents to fire a firearm to be able [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1005.92s)]
*  to shoot. We teach them defensive tactics and methods of defending themselves and protecting [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1011.36s)]
*  others as well. So they go through that entire process so that not only can they analyze records, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1016.0s)]
*  but they also have that law enforcement component. So in an actual democracy, IRS agents should be [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  taught to be polite, but under Joe Biden, IRS agents are taught, quote, to shoot. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1027.76s)]
*  How's that not war on the population of the country? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxn7wWe9h0&t=1032.96s)]
