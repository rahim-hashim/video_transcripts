# What fostered the friendship between Dana White and Donald Trump?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw)
*  It's interesting to find out what famous people are actually like. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot of prominent people are not that great, honestly. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  And you know that because they're not loyal to the people who work for them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=5.0s)]
*  Loyalty is a prerequisite for an honorable life, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=8.52s)]
*  and Dana White has demonstrated it to the people around him. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=11.28s)]
*  He's also loyal to his friends, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=14.4s)]
*  even if his friends turn out to be the most controversial people in the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=16.04s)]
*  And Dana White is friends with Donald Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=20.96s)]
*  They've been friends for decades. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=22.88s)]
*  And as a result of that, he spoke when Trump asked him [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=25.88s)]
*  at the Republican National Convention in 2016. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=28.16s)]
*  Took a lot of heat for that, but he didn't care. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=31.72s)]
*  He's not afraid. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=34.04s)]
*  That maybe is the most obvious point about Dana White. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=34.96s)]
*  He's just not afraid. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=37.76s)]
*  Maybe because he's in work at some dumb nonprofit or the Washington Post. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=38.92s)]
*  He's in a very violent sport. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=41.76s)]
*  In any case, he was not afraid to tell us about his relationship with Trump, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  and it was worth hearing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=46.08s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=47.04s)]
*  So I talked to Trump yesterday about you, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=49.6s)]
*  and he described you as the only essential person in all American sports. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=52.72s)]
*  He said, you could take key people out of any sport, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=58.32s)]
*  and the sport would continue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=60.84s)]
*  If Dana White left UFC, there couldn't be UFC. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=62.32s)]
*  Now, I don't know what you think of that assessment, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=65.56s)]
*  but it did make me wonder how long are you? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=67.32s)]
*  You're the same age as I am, 53. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=69.44s)]
*  How long are you going to do this? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=70.72s)]
*  Well, I love him and I appreciate that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  And hopefully, I've built a business over the last 22 years [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=73.68s)]
*  that no matter who comes and goes will last and continue to grow. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  I also know for a fact that when I do leave, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=85.16s)]
*  the right person needs to be in place to take over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=90.12s)]
*  because there is a formula to this business. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Many other people have tried it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Many people are trying it right now as we speak and have not been successful, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  and I know why they haven't been successful. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=102.56s)]
*  I know exactly why they haven't been successful. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=104.36s)]
*  And when I watch them running their businesses, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=106.2s)]
*  I just shake my head and go, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=110.0s)]
*  So hopefully, when I do decide to leave, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  which isn't going to be anytime soon because I still love what I'm doing, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=116.4s)]
*  still as passionate about it as I was day one, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  I have the right people in place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=123.08s)]
*  Plus, I've built a phenomenal team here, phenomenal team. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=124.36s)]
*  No one guy just does anything. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=130.72s)]
*  You need a really great team to surround yourself with, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=133.6s)]
*  and I've done that, and that's why, you know, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=136.96s)]
*  there's no way that I was going to let any of these people leave when COVID hit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=139.28s)]
*  I knew that you knew Trump, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=143.4s)]
*  and I knew you were a Trump supporter, broadly speaking. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=145.48s)]
*  I didn't realize you were like a legit old friend of Trump's because of work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=147.4s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=152.12s)]
*  He's a very, very good friend of mine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump has been such a good friend to me since the day I met him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=156.0s)]
*  We originally, when we bought this company, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  this company had such a bad stigma attached to it in the sport [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=163.16s)]
*  that we couldn't even get into venues. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=166.4s)]
*  Venues didn't want us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=167.88s)]
*  And Donald Trump saw that this thing could possibly be big. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=169.68s)]
*  Plus, he's a sports guy. He loves sports. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=174.88s)]
*  And he offered us to come do the event at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=177.28s)]
*  Cut us a very fair deal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=183.12s)]
*  We went down there and we did two events with him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=184.68s)]
*  He showed up for the first fight, stayed till the last fight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=187.56s)]
*  And you can imagine back then, Trump brand here, UFC brand down here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=191.28s)]
*  But he took us in and he was great. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  Everything that ever happened to me in my career after that day, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=197.8s)]
*  the first guy to reach out and say congratulations was Donald Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=202.84s)]
*  Whether it was a letter. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=206.68s)]
*  We were on the cover of the New York Times one time, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  and he said, I always knew you were going to do it, Dana. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  Congratulations and sent me the paper. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=213.88s)]
*  Sent me a pen one time congratulating me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=216.44s)]
*  You know, always sending something and saying congratulations, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=219.04s)]
*  like a guy who was genuinely happy for your success. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=222.16s)]
*  There aren't a ton of those. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=227.16s)]
*  No. And then came the day he was running for president [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=228.28s)]
*  and he reached out to me, called me one day and he said, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=232.56s)]
*  he started the conversation like this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=235.12s)]
*  If you don't want to do this, I completely understand. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  And there are no hard feelings. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=240.92s)]
*  But I would be honored if you would speak for me at the National Republican Convention. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  I said, I'll be there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=247.28s)]
*  Donald was the first guy that recognized the potential that we saw in the UFC [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=248.72s)]
*  and encouraged us to build our business. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=253.96s)]
*  He hosted our first two events at his venue. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=257.04s)]
*  He dealt with us personally. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=259.76s)]
*  He got in the trenches with us and he made a deal that worked for everyone. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=261.44s)]
*  So you're the best, man. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=265.4s)]
*  You've always been a great guy to me. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=266.64s)]
*  You've been a good friend of me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=268.44s)]
*  And I spoke that day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=270.04s)]
*  And let me tell you what, after that day, when I spoke for him at the convention, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=272.08s)]
*  our friendship went to a whole other level. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=276.12s)]
*  This guy's been so good to me. It's unexplainable. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=278.76s)]
*  That's fascinating. Yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=282.04s)]
*  In a window into something that we don't get to see, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  did you take a lot of abuse for that or do people just accept that this is a real friendship? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=286.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm in the abuse business. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=292.88s)]
*  We take abuse every day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=297.0s)]
*  So I don't know. You'd have to explain to me what the abuse on the Trump side would be. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=298.6s)]
*  You know, I get it. There's people, you know, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=303.08s)]
*  this is what's sad. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=305.84s)]
*  You know, obviously, I did not vote for President Biden. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=307.08s)]
*  He's my president. He's the president of the United States right now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=310.68s)]
*  And I'm American. I don't dislike or hate anybody who voted for Biden. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=313.12s)]
*  The fact that you're the type of person that would actually hate somebody because of who they voted for shows me exactly who you are. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=317.92s)]
*  I don't want to know you anyway. Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=327.0s)]
*  You're not my kind of person. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=329.84s)]
*  And I don't want to be friends with you either. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=331.28s)]
*  So the feeling is very mutual. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's not because of who you voted for. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=334.72s)]
*  It's because of how you carry yourself, who you vote for, what you decide to do with your life means nothing to me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  That's that's your own personal choice in America. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  This is a free country and you can choose to vote or do whatever you want to do with your personal life. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl4l--jwZKw&t=345.88000000000005s)]
