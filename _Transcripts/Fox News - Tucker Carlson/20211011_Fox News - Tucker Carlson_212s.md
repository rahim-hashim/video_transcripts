# Tucker: Airline employees have more power than they realize
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis)
*  One of those good people is Joshua Yoder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a commercial airline pilot. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=2.64s)]
*  He's co-founder of the group US Freedom Flyers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=3.92s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=6.76s)]
*  Mr. Yoder, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  So, summarize for us, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=9.88s)]
*  pilots who have raised questions about these mandates [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=12.68s)]
*  have been, as noted, dismissed as criminals, terrorists. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=15.48s)]
*  Tell us your motive in resisting this mandate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=20.82s)]
*  Tucker, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=26.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=28.68s)]
*  My motive for resisting it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=30.72s)]
*  is primarily religious for myself. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=32.24s)]
*  Basically, I saw, among my friends, I saw a need. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=35.24s)]
*  Many of us don't want to take this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=39.6s)]
*  People were being coerced. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=41.32s)]
*  I believe in freedom, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=42.96s)]
*  and I'm here to support the freedom of my fellow employees [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=44.36s)]
*  and all people across this country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm not going to take a mandate. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=49.28s)]
*  I'm not going to be coerced into doing something [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=50.64s)]
*  that I don't believe in. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=52.36s)]
*  So, there are two levels on which to assess this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=54.56s)]
*  One is the level that you just described, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  the level that preserves American society, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  as we've known it for 250 years, with freedom at its core, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  because if they can make, airline pilots do this, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  they can make airline travelers do this, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=66.88s)]
*  and there's no end to what they can make you do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=68.44s)]
*  But describe, if you would, since you work in the business, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=70.56s)]
*  what the effect on our national transportation infrastructure [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=72.92s)]
*  is about to be because of these mandates. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=76.2s)]
*  Well, as we know, the transportation sector [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=80.0s)]
*  is the heart and soul of this country, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  and it's a very delicate system. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=84.72s)]
*  If there's a disruption in one part of the system, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=87.12s)]
*  it has a catastrophic effect among the rest of the system, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=89.56s)]
*  which is going to affect commerce, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=93.6s)]
*  it's going to affect trade, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  and ultimately it's going to affect the economy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  If you have flights reduced by 30% [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  because 30% of pilots are fired [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=102.16s)]
*  because they won't take the vaccine, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=103.96s)]
*  this is going to affect how your goods get here from overseas, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=105.8s)]
*  how they're distributed to the stores. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=108.72s)]
*  The same thing's happening with the truckers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=110.32s)]
*  It's happening in the shipping industry. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Those Amazon boxes that typically show up in two days, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=113.84s)]
*  you might be looking at three weeks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, it turns out that people with essential skills, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=119.2s)]
*  like airline mechanics, air traffic controllers, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=122.84s)]
*  and yes, commercial airline pilots, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=125.2s)]
*  have more power maybe than they realized. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=127.36s)]
*  You've got to wonder if people are being pushed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=131.08s)]
*  to the point where they're going to be fired, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  how many more of these sick-outs, job actions, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=135.36s)]
*  whatever strikes, whatever you're going to call [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=140.12s)]
*  what we saw this weekend, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=142.2s)]
*  how many more of these do you think we're likely to see? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=143.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, we have all the control, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  and the control comes from a simple word, and that's no. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=149.28s)]
*  We just don't need to comply. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=152.76s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, I will never promote a sick-out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  or a work action. That is illegal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=157.48s)]
*  With US Freedom Flyers, the organization that I'm with, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=159.88s)]
*  we will never promote such a thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=162.6s)]
*  With that being said, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=164.28s)]
*  we also cannot control the actions of individuals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=165.28s)]
*  And I think that you will see massive disruptions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  in supply chain and in your travel [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  if we just stand up and say no. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=174.44s)]
*  If these companies fire us and they fire 30% of the workforce, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=176.2s)]
*  aircraft are going to stop moving, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=179.56s)]
*  and it's going to affect you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=181.2s)]
*  It's going to affect your air travel, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=182.32s)]
*  and it's going to affect the economy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=183.72s)]
*  Joe Biden will say this is your fault. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=185.72s)]
*  Finally, how do you respond to that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=187.72s)]
*  He'll blame you for this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=189.48s)]
*  It's his fault. It's squarely his fault. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  I think anyone with a critical mind [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=194.2s)]
*  can point towards the federal government [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=196.8s)]
*  and the companies that are enforcing these illegal mandates [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=198.32s)]
*  from the federal government [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=200.56s)]
*  and see that it's the federal government's fault. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=201.76s)]
*  It certainly is. It certainly is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=204.4s)]
*  This is an amazing moment. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  Joshua Yoder, thank you so much for coming on tonight [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=207.08s)]
*  for your bravery. Appreciate it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=209.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1OxjtAis&t=210.96s)]
