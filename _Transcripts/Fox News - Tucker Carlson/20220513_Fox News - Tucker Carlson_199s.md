# 'Dog and Cat Bill of Rights' introduced in California
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg)
*  So under Tony Fauci the US government has funded horrifying experiments that torture and kill dogs for no good reason [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=0.0s)]
*  We've gotten nothing useful in science from this torture and yet Fauci has spent more than [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=7.74s)]
*  $400,000 to trap beagles in mesh cages where they're bitten to death by flies [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=14.22s)]
*  So this is horrifying. It should never happen again. How do we prevent dogs from being murdered? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=20.5s)]
*  Just so Tony Fauci can spread more money around to his friends. Judy Mancuso has been working on this for a long time [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=28.7s)]
*  She's arguing that lawmakers in California should create a bill of rights for cats and dogs [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=33.94s)]
*  She's CEO and president of social compassion in legislation. We're grateful for her efforts and happy to welcome her tonight [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=38.14s)]
*  Judy, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us how you could stop this [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, our bill is actually directed at [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  people who adopt at [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=54.46s)]
*  Shelters so the dog and cat bill of rights is a list of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=56.82s)]
*  Specific rights that dogs and cats should have that will be posted at shelters [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=62.78s)]
*  humane societies rescue groups [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=69.34s)]
*  So that people who are adopting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=72.78s)]
*  Understand what exactly the expectations are in having an animal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=76.02s)]
*  right [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=83.7s)]
*  Would that prevent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=84.78s)]
*  Do you think the kind of cruelty you're seeing in these pointless experiments on animals? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=87.38s)]
*  People are being paid to torture animals to death. There's no evidence that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=92.86s)]
*  Human lives are saved because of it [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=96.58s)]
*  Well, that would be a completely different bill and we did work on a bill that had to do with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=100.02s)]
*  cosmetics and personal hygiene [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=108.41999999999999s)]
*  products sold in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  California that shall not be tested on animals [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=112.58000000000001s)]
*  So that is something that California did do we got signed into law? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  but your the conversation you're having about animals and testing is a whole other one that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=123.06s)]
*  We would love to address because it is our taxpayer dollars that go to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=130.58s)]
*  animal experiments in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  universities across the United States [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=139.74s)]
*  So not only is it in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  universities with our taxpayer dollars it is public and privately funded and a lot of these [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=145.14s)]
*  These experiments have been done before and they don't need to continue and there are non animal tests that have higher [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=152.98s)]
*  efficacy rate that should be used [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=162.89999999999998s)]
*  So I hope this is the first step toward doing that your animal bill of rights in the state of California something good to come out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=166.66s)]
*  Of California because if you can mistreat dogs, you'll mistreat people. I don't think there's any question about it. Well, there's a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=172.02s)]
*  direct correlation [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=177.66s)]
*  That is well documented of that. Yes, it certainly is. I appreciate it. Do you make you so thank you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHlAZAz_9lg&t=179.54000000000002s)]
