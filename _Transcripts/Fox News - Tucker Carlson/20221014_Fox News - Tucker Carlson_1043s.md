# Tucker Carlson: This should be a crime -- it's dark and horrifying
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Friday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=2.4s)]
*  In your head, you always imagine the revolution when it starts will start with tanks and gunfire, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=3.72s)]
*  with chaos and soldiers in the street. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=8.8s)]
*  You'll know when it comes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  But it never does. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=13.8s)]
*  Instead, the really big changes to American life, the profound ones that affect all of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=14.8s)]
*  us forever, those changes almost always begin quietly with gentle pleas for tolerance. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  We'd like to do things a little differently, they tell you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=27.04s)]
*  We'd like to make a change to some customer belief that people have been attached to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=29.68s)]
*  for the last few thousand years. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=33.28s)]
*  But don't be alarmed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=34.92s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=35.92s)]
*  You don't even need to participate. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=37.24s)]
*  All we ask is that you let us live the way we want to live. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=39.08s)]
*  That's always the pitch. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=43.28s)]
*  And of course, you always agree to it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=44.28s)]
*  Why wouldn't you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=45.84s)]
*  Who could say no to that? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=46.84s)]
*  Some guy down the street wants to wear a dress? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=48.54s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Have a party. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=52.3s)]
*  It doesn't affect you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=53.4s)]
*  You don't have to wear a dress. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=54.4s)]
*  So go ahead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=55.96s)]
*  Live and let live. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=57.32s)]
*  But it turns out that's never actually the deal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=60.16s)]
*  The guy down the street wears his dress, but after a while, that's not enough for him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=63.46s)]
*  He's still angry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=67.64s)]
*  And for some reason, he's angry with you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=69.2s)]
*  And that doesn't make sense because you're the person who had no problem with him wearing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=72.52s)]
*  a dress in the first place. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=75.44s)]
*  What did you do wrong? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=76.72s)]
*  Well, the problem is you're not wearing a dress and neither are your kids. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=77.72s)]
*  Your normal person clothes, the ones you've always worn, are suddenly immoral. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=82.84s)]
*  You've got to change immediately. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=87.2s)]
*  Whoa, wait a second, you say? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=88.92s)]
*  That's not what we agreed to. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=92.68s)]
*  You do your thing and I'll do mine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=94.34s)]
*  Remember? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=97.04s)]
*  They don't remember. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=99.5s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=100.56s)]
*  You don't get to do your thing anymore. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=102.4s)]
*  The dress guy's in charge now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=104.94s)]
*  Everybody's got to do his thing, the dress thing, or face punishment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  That's how it goes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=111.68s)]
*  Be tolerant becomes show some respect, which evolves very quickly into bow down before [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=113.2s)]
*  us and lick our feet or else we'll hurt you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=118.84s)]
*  That's the final stage. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=122.48s)]
*  That's where we are now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=123.48s)]
*  For example, a Democratic lawmaker in Virginia called Elizabeth Guzman is introducing a bill [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=125.36s)]
*  that will charge parents with a felony, strip them of their employment, and imprison them [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=130.0s)]
*  if they don't wholeheartedly endorse their minor children's sex changes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=135.46s)]
*  So your 12 year old daughter says she wants a mastectomy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=140.8s)]
*  If you object to that in any way, if you raise questions, Elizabeth Guzman will send you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=144.28s)]
*  to jail for real. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Here's a local news report. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Her bill would expand the state's definition of child abuse and neglect to include parents [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=155.28s)]
*  who do not affirm their child's gender identity or sexual orientation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  There's an investigation also in place that is not only, you know, from a social worker, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=164.96s)]
*  but there's also a police investigation before we make the decision that there's going to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=170.08s)]
*  be a CPS charge. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=175.08s)]
*  What could the penalties be? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=177.0s)]
*  If, you know, the investigation concludes and it's concluded that a parent is not affirming [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=178.0s)]
*  of their LGBTQ child, what could the consequences be? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=182.8s)]
*  Well, we first have to have an investigation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, it could be a felony, it could be a misdemeanor, but we know that a CPS charge [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=190.0s)]
*  could harm, you know, your employment, could harm your education. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  So who is this Elizabeth Guzman? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=200.96s)]
*  Well, Elizabeth Guzman came to this country not so long ago from Peru as a single mother. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  Now rather than wait a while, maybe spend a few generations here before telling you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=209.44s)]
*  how to raise your children in America, she's decided to get right to it and completely [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=214.0s)]
*  change child rearing in this country in a way that would never be tolerated for a second [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=219.52s)]
*  in the country from which she comes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  Try that in the Andes, honey, and see how that works. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=226.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=230.2s)]
*  But in this country, according to Elizabeth Guzman, you have to affirm your child's sex [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  change or else you're going to prison and the state will raise your kids. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=237.16s)]
*  Now you've got to think, maybe they've wanted this for a while. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=242.2s)]
*  What would this mean? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, it would mean fewer intact families. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  It would mean people like Elizabeth Guzman make the decisions, the meaningful decisions [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=249.88s)]
*  within your house. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=254.16s)]
*  It means less resistance from you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=255.48s)]
*  It means more powerful them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=257.38s)]
*  What it doesn't mean is that Elizabeth Guzman will be protecting your kids. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=259.62s)]
*  She doesn't even claim this law will protect your kids. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=263.96s)]
*  Instead, she acknowledges the whole point is to quote, educate parents. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=266.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=272.32s)]
*  So like the COVID vaccine, this is a pretty easy way to figure out who's on which side. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=273.84s)]
*  Are you for this? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  Okay, you're on our team. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  You're willing to surrender control of your own children to Elizabeth Guzman, who again, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=283.6s)]
*  just got here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  But if you're not for it, then we know you're not on our team. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=289.72s)]
*  We know who you are. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  We can silence you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=295.06s)]
*  We can punish you because you refuse to be educated. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's a signaling mechanism. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  And you know that because the ideology that underlies it, gender ideology, is completely [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  incoherent. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  It is not rooted in science. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  It's a form of religion. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=313.64s)]
*  It dares you to say something about it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=314.88s)]
*  What? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=318.08s)]
*  You can't even say that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=319.08s)]
*  If you do, they know you're on the other side. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=320.08s)]
*  And it's not just lunatics and ideologues like Elizabeth Guzman from Peru. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=322.64s)]
*  It's doctors. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=327.8s)]
*  It's medical professionals. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=328.8s)]
*  Here's a video from Boston Children's Hospital, one of the most famous hospitals in the world, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=330.4s)]
*  which like many hospitals in the United States at this point under the Joe Biden administration, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=335.08s)]
*  cuts the breasts off of minor girls for no medically justifiable reason. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=340.24s)]
*  Watch a practicing psychologist, an attending psychologist at Boston Children's Hospital, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=350.04s)]
*  explain how early children can become trans. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=354.52s)]
*  So most of the patients that we have in the Jemps Clinic actually know their gender usually [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=358.72s)]
*  around the age of puberty. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=362.6s)]
*  But a good portion of children do know as early as seemingly from the womb. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=363.6s)]
*  And they will usually express their gender identity as very young children. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=368.24s)]
*  Some as soon as they can talk, they might say phrases such as I'm a girl or I'm a boy [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=371.76000000000005s)]
*  or I'm going to be a woman or I'm going to be a mom. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=375.44s)]
*  Kids know very, very early. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  So in the Jemps Clinic, we see a variety of young children all the way down to ages two [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=380.84000000000003s)]

*  Has she raised a lot of kids? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=396.47999999999996s)]

*  Because she's telling you if your little kid says, oh, maybe I'm the other sex, that means [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  your kid is the other sex. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=404.76s)]
*  Well, that's insane because almost 100% of kids at one point or another at a certain [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=406.76s)]
*  point in development say things like, I think I'm a boy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=411.23999999999995s)]

*  So think about what they're telling you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=424.32s)]
*  They're telling you the developing child in the womb is just a part of the mother. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=427.9s)]
*  Therefore, you can abort that child at any time. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  It's like an appendectomy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  But at the same time, that same cluster of cells, that fetus, can also be woke and ascribed [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=437.28s)]
*  to left liberal gender ideology. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=444.36s)]

*  So no sane person could believe any of this voluntarily. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=449.78s)]

*  Again, it's a religion. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=455.85999999999996s)]
*  And if you resist it, they resort immediately to force. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=457.53999999999996s)]

*  But what else is that? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=499.98s)]
*  That's totalitarian. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=501.02s)]

*  in the United States where people are free to believe what they want and to talk about [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=512.6999999999999s)]

*  Watch. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=530.06s)]
*  Obviously, the question becomes then when misinformation, disinformation is being spread, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=531.26s)]
*  when hate and threats are being spread, where are the social media companies? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=535.42s)]
*  What's YouTube doing? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=538.66s)]
*  What's Twitter doing? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=539.66s)]
*  And of course, then you have the reaction to that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=540.66s)]
*  Oh, this is big tech silencing people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=542.18s)]

*  Yeah, it does. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=548.02s)]

*  It's so funny. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=571.34s)]
*  Back to the point at the open, when the revolution comes, there won't be tanks and soldiers, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=572.34s)]
*  there won't be storm troopers and old uniforms and symbols. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=575.5s)]

*  Okay. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=792.5s)]
*  On top of that, the European Journal of Endocrinology, among many other publications, has found that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=793.5s)]
*  so-called puberty blockers often cause quote decreased bone density, which is associated [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=796.74s)]
*  with a high risk of osteoporosis. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=803.0200000000001s)]
*  And there are other permanent side effects as well. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=805.84s)]
*  We don't even know the scope of them because this has never been tested longitudinally [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=808.46s)]
*  ever. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  But the effects are very obvious and if you poke around on the internet for about four [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=813.86s)]
*  minutes you will see them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=816.94s)]
*  One teenage girl just uploaded a video showing the effects of five years of puberty blockers [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=818.66s)]
*  on her. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=822.78s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=823.94s)]
*  When I talk about being too far gone, I don't really know what else to call it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=824.94s)]
*  This is what I mean. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=831.24s)]
*  This is how deep my voice is. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=832.34s)]
*  It's gotten deeper over time and it's settled. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=835.34s)]
*  This is what I mean by hair loss and it just keeps getting worse. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=839.2s)]
*  It keeps thinning. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=842.42s)]
*  It keeps receding backwards. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=843.42s)]
*  You know, and I'm not exactly sure that's coming back. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=844.42s)]
*  Those are the main things when I talk about being androgenized to a point of no return. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=849.5799999999999s)]
*  This is what happens when you give a woman testosterone for five years. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=854.78s)]
*  This is what happens. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=857.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happens. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=859.26s)]
*  That and a lot of other things. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=861.5799999999999s)]
*  That's what they're telling you is gender affirming? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=863.3s)]
*  No. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  It's mutilation. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=866.2199999999999s)]
*  It's grotesque. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=867.2199999999999s)]
*  It's destroying people's lives, children's lives. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=868.2199999999999s)]
*  We made a documentary on this for Tucker Carlson Originals. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=870.6999999999999s)]
*  We spoke to a lot of people who had endured similar torture. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=872.8599999999999s)]
*  The testosterone kind of had this effect on me where with every step that I took, it would [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  feel good for a short amount of time. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=882.42s)]
*  But then eventually it's like those same feelings come back up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=884.42s)]
*  There's the initial euphoria that you go through. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=887.8199999999999s)]
*  I change my gender and everything's going to be wonderful. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=891.3399999999999s)]
*  It was euphoric. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=895.26s)]
*  I was like, the feeling I had when I started living as a man was I was free. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=897.78s)]
*  I was finally who I should have been all along. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=904.22s)]
*  But that euphoria was short lived. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  My mental health just got worse. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=910.18s)]
*  My ability to socialize just got worse. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  I felt so disconnected from myself. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=914.9s)]
*  I started using like drugs and alcohol as a crutch and I was just a total disaster. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=916.9399999999999s)]
*  And the effects of the testosterone on my mental health specifically just made everything [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=925.02s)]
*  10 million times worse. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=930.38s)]
*  I had bled into the lie. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=932.5s)]
*  And it almost took my life. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=935.02s)]
*  It's just awful. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=941.14s)]
*  And every person who's participating in this, in their moments of clarity, knows that 10 [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=942.14s)]
*  years from now there will be thousands of vocal victims of this moment of true craziness [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=947.98s)]
*  and hysteria that has gripped our country. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=954.82s)]
*  People's lives are being destroyed right before us. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=957.3000000000001s)]
*  Most adults are too cowardly to say a word about it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=960.1800000000001s)]
*  And the Democratic Party is actively doing all it can to promote this, to protect hospitals [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=962.86s)]
*  that are mutilating and destroying the lives of children. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=968.62s)]
*  In the state of California, always a bellwether, a legislator called Scott Weiner has just [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=971.5s)]
*  sponsored legislation to make California a so-called sanctuary state for kids who want [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=975.4200000000001s)]
*  to mutilate their own bodies, to castrate themselves. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=979.94s)]
*  Scott Weiner? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=982.7800000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=983.7800000000001s)]
*  Would you trust this guy within 500 yards of a child? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=985.74s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=987.74s)]
*  Gavin Newsom just signed the bill. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=988.74s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=990.62s)]
*  So what's the point here? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=992.62s)]
*  It's certainly not to protect children. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=993.78s)]
*  It's not protecting them. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=995.14s)]
*  Any parent will tell you if you want to protect children, you tell them to take a deep breath [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=996.8199999999999s)]
*  and reach adulthood and then make rational decisions about how to live their lives. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1001.56s)]
*  You would definitely not let them make a decision, an irreversible decision like this for themselves. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1006.14s)]
*  You're their parent. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1011.6999999999999s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1012.6999999999999s)]
*  But the Democratic Party doesn't like parents. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1013.82s)]
*  The Democratic Party is replacing parents with itself. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1015.22s)]
*  We're in charge now. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1018.58s)]
*  It's the most recognizable possible move for any totalitarian movement. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1019.58s)]
*  Break up the family, replace parents with politicians. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1024.94s)]
*  The state is in charge. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  The party is in charge. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1028.8600000000001s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1029.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's happening all over the country. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljimp0eI0Fs&t=1030.8600000000001s)]
