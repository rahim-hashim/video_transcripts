# East Palestine, Ohio residents tell Tucker they have headaches, are coughing up blood
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw)
*  Well, Joe Biden is in Poland doing his semi-literate Winston Churchill imitation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=0.0s)]
*  His own country doesn't seem to be improving. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=4.32s)]
*  Thousands of Americans in East Palestine, Ohio, for example, are worried about their [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=6.24s)]
*  health and their finances. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=11.16s)]
*  Fox's Garrett Tenney just spoke to one of them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=12.64s)]
*  Half a mile down the tracks from where a Norfolk Southern train derailed, Chris Ramoldi says [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=19.28s)]
*  like a lot of people in this town, he's stuck. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  I do roofing and siding for a living. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Are you going to want to put siding and a new roof on your house that your property values are dropping? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=28.48s)]
*  So my future is uncertain as far as my business in this town. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=32.08s)]
*  Chris also isn't convinced the air inside his home is safe despite testing by the railway last week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=36.08s)]
*  His family's health issues haven't gone away, and yesterday he says his fianc√© found an [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=42.08s)]
*  oily sheen on top of their dehumidifier's water. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  So that tells me that if this chemical sticks to water, my dehumidifier's taking water [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  out of the air in the basement, it's obviously still there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  So as all this is going on, the transportation secretary, who's supposed to be preventing train derailments, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=59.08s)]
*  hasn't bothered to visit East Palestine, Ohio more than two weeks after the derailment, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=64.48s)]
*  more than two weeks after authorities lit the toxic chemicals on fire. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't have time, but he does have time to do morning shows. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=74.68s)]
*  He just did. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=77.88s)]
*  When are you going to go to East Palestine? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=80.48s)]
*  Well, I am planning to go. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=84.28s)]
*  When I go, the focus is going to be on action. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=85.68s)]
*  Look, I was mayor of my hometown for eight years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=87.88s)]
*  We dealt with a lot of disasters, natural and human. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=90.08s)]
*  And one of the things I noticed very quickly is that there's two kinds of people who show up [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=94.08s)]
*  when you have that kind of disaster experience. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=98.88s)]
*  People who are there because they have a specific job to do and are there to get something done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=101.28s)]
*  And people who are there to look good and have their picture taken. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=106.08s)]
*  When I go, it will be about action on rail safety. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=108.88s)]
*  If there's any member of the Biden administration who deserves to lose his job immediately, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  it's that guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=116.68s)]
*  Nathan and Kelly Izotic are in East Palestine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  They live there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  We talked to them a couple of days ago. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=121.68s)]
*  And since we spoke, they tell us they've been coughing up blood. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  So we want to get an update from Nathan and Kelly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=125.68s)]
*  Join us now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=127.48s)]
*  Thank you both for coming on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=128.08s)]
*  Nathan, first to you, coughing up blood. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Tucker. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=135.08s)]
*  It was days after the incident and that's it would have been the Sunday and I woke up in a very horrific [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  coughing spell almost like a bronchitis or pneumonia type. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=143.08s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know if it was just from the coughing fits or what, but spats of blood did appear that night. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=147.08s)]
*  And a few days later, obviously we evacuated town. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=153.68s)]
*  It resided and went away. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=157.08s)]
*  But that was one of the side effects. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=158.28s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=160.28s)]
*  I am 30 now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Just turned 30 back in February 16th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=166.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm no doctor, but you should not be coughing up blood. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  We're going to speak to a doctor in a minute. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=171.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm telling you what you know, but that's not a good sign. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=173.08s)]
*  Kelly, how are you feeling? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=176.68s)]
*  The headaches are horrible. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=180.28s)]
*  They pretty much when I'm about three to four miles outside of town, they start and as long as I'm within a few miles [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=182.68s)]
*  of the crash site, I've got headaches, really bad headaches, migraines. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Has anyone tried to explain to you why you might be having these symptoms? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=200.88s)]
*  Well, if we're talking the Ohio Dr. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=208.68s)]
*  Fauci's, we can go and you know, they're going to try to point it towards having COVID related symptoms. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=211.38s)]
*  But we obviously know that's not the case. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=216.78s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's not the case. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=219.48s)]
*  Coughing up blood is not, I don't think a valid COVID symptom at this point. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=220.48s)]
*  How does it smell? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=225.18s)]
*  I mean, we have a sense of smell for a reason. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=226.18s)]
*  The nose knows that, you know, there's truth in that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  How does your town smell? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=230.08s)]
*  I mean, it's still blatant. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=233.38s)]
*  Even your cameraman here, that's one of the first things I asked him was, you know, do you smell what's smelling outside? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=235.18s)]
*  And he says, yeah, it's a sweet odor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=240.68s)]
*  It smells terrible. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=244.28s)]
*  And again, it's more towards the evening when it's more prominent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=245.68s)]
*  I hate to ask you about money, but I can't resist. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, what about homeowners in East Palestine? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=253.98s)]
*  Like you've got to think that their home values are bottoming out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=256.18s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=262.78s)]
*  Nobody is ever going to purchase a home that has East Palestine in the address. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=263.58s)]
*  I mean, this is this has definitely made our value plummet. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=269.18s)]
*  Are you homeowners? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=273.68s)]
*  Yes, we are homeowners here, sir. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=276.68s)]
*  Man, I'm so sorry. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=279.78s)]
*  The future isn't yeah, the future isn't right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, your health and your wealth gone in May. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=284.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=290.88s)]
*  I'm really sorry, but we appreciate the update from both of you tonight. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=291.58s)]
*  Nathan and Kelly is exotic. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLHDp_7Bbw&t=295.78s)]
