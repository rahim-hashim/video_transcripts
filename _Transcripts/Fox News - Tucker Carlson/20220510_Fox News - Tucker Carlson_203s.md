# We have a major cleanup job ahead of us: President of Wisconsin Family Action
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw)
*  Julian Appling is with the Wisconsin Family Action Office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=0.0s)]
*  the place that was just firebombed in Madison. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=3.0s)]
*  Sorry, where a fire broke out. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=5.24s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=7.2s)]
*  A fire broke out. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=8.4s)]
*  I'm sorry even to say that to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=9.32s)]
*  It's gotta be painful since it was your office [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=11.6s)]
*  that was firebombed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=14.24s)]
*  What do you make of the coverage of this, by the way? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=15.4s)]
*  Well, the coverage has been amazing, Tucker. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=18.84s)]
*  And to see this thing go national, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=21.92s)]
*  it's been quite an experience, to be honest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=25.04s)]
*  We're an advocacy group, an educational group. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=29.2s)]
*  We do come at the issues of the day [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=31.56s)]
*  from a Christian perspective. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  And to be honest with you, I wasn't sure what would happen [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=35.04s)]
*  after I found out that we had had this Molotov cocktails [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=37.58s)]
*  thrown into our office, fires ignited, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=41.66s)]
*  and graffiti written on the outside walls of our building. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  So the coverage has been mixed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=48.12s)]
*  I've talked to some media outlets where basically they said [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  that, hey, you guys did this, it's an inside job. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=53.32s)]
*  Yeah, right, we're going to destroy our own office. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=56.24s)]
*  That's certainly patently false. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Overall, though, I must tell you that other than referring [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  to us as an anti-abortion group, which we would prefer [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=64.76s)]
*  to be recognized for being pro-life, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=68.66s)]
*  the coverage, at least at the local level, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  and I think to some degree at the national level, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=73.58s)]
*  has been fairly even-handed because we have such evidence. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=75.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm walking on glass in my office. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=79.68s)]
*  We have a major cleanup job ahead of us [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=82.12s)]
*  in order to get back to business as normal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=83.96s)]
*  And Tucker, may I say, you are exactly right [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=86.96s)]
*  in your monologue. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=89.44s)]
*  This is fundamentally because we hold a Christian worldview [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  and actually live it out when I work in the legislature [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=95.16s)]
*  with legislators or when we talk to in churches [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=98.58s)]
*  or when we take our message to the media. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=101.96s)]
*  That is the core issue. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=104.08s)]
*  Well, yeah, and it's a pretty, I mean, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  not every Christian leader fairly represents Christianity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of lousy Christian leaders out there, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=114.92s)]
*  but Christian people are the kindest people, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=115.76s)]
*  the most committed to human rights of any group. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=119.72s)]
*  I can't think of another more committed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=121.44s)]
*  Why do you think they hate you so much? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=123.84s)]
*  Well, you said it well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=126.52s)]
*  We stand in their way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=127.84s)]
*  I have been at this for 25 years and I've said it repeatedly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  When there is an impediment in the way of the liberal agenda, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=132.4s)]
*  they have to find a way to sideline you, to silence you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=135.76s)]
*  And I've even been told their ultimate goal [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=138.76s)]
*  is to destroy us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=141.56s)]
*  I'd say they tried that on Sunday morning, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=142.5s)]
*  under the cloak of darkness when they attacked our office. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=145.06s)]
*  That was the goal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=148.38s)]
*  They want us to go away. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=149.42s)]
*  They want us to be cowed into silence. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=151.1s)]
*  And I'm telling you right now, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=153.66s)]
*  they pick the wrong group if that's what they want, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=155.06s)]
*  because this has made us stronger. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=157.36s)]
*  This has made us bolder. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=159.3s)]
*  We're not gonna go away. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=160.86s)]
*  We're not gonna be quiet. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=161.78s)]
*  We are speaking truth. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=163.14s)]
*  We're helping people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=164.9s)]
*  We're encouraging people to stand up and show up [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=165.98s)]
*  and speak up on these issues. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=169.7s)]
*  And they've got to silence us in order to keep us [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=171.42s)]
*  from getting in the way of their agenda. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  And their agenda is truly to make Christianity exactly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=184.77999999999997s)]
*  Julian Appling, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=185.61999999999998s)]
*  And I'm sorry about what happened. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=187.38s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6Rki4AnDw&t=189.7s)]
