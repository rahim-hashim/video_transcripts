# Biden administration promises a response if Russia invades Ukraine: Macgregor
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4)
*  So where's all this going exactly? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=0.0s)]
*  What can we expect over the next month or two? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=1.96s)]
*  Colonel Douglas MacGregor has thought a lot about it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=4.28s)]
*  He's lived a lot of the stuff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=6.32s)]
*  He joins us now to assess. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=7.32s)]
*  Doug, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Where is this going, do you think? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=10.64s)]
*  Well, based upon your monologue, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=13.92s)]
*  it's hard to tell right now, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=15.72s)]
*  but certainly the destination is the land of the stupids. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=16.88s)]
*  You know, what's really disturbing is that this is the eve [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=21.52s)]
*  of the 80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=24.28s)]
*  an event that dragged us into a two-front war [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=26.8s)]
*  for which we were completely unprepared. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=29.16s)]
*  And listening to the comments by Wicker and others, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=31.8s)]
*  it strikes me that Joe Biden has lots of friends on the Hill, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=35.08s)]
*  all of which are living with him in the early 1990s. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=38.68s)]
*  They seem to think that Russia is prostrate, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=42.9s)]
*  that Russia has no alternative but to submit [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  to whatever we tell it to do, which of course is ridiculous. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=48.92s)]
*  If we challenge Russia on its doorstep, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=52.56s)]
*  and by doorstep I mean Eastern Ukraine, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=56.2s)]
*  militarily, we will be defeated. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=59.6s)]
*  That's not an if, that's a certainty. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=62.32s)]
*  And if we are stupid enough to consider the use [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=64.72s)]
*  of nuclear weapons to rescue our conventional failure, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=67.88s)]
*  well, then we're courting the destruction [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=72.08s)]
*  of the known world, frankly, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=74.12s)]
*  and that's something we should avoid. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=76.64s)]
*  We have really only one interest. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=78.62s)]
*  You asked the key question, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=80.44s)]
*  what is our interest in Ukraine or Russia in that area [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=82.6s)]
*  for that matter? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=85.84s)]
*  We have one interest, Tucker, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=87.16s)]
*  that is to prevent a war from breaking out [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=88.96s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  a bloody war with implications involving refugees [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=94.88s)]
*  and millions of people being displaced from their homes, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=98.96s)]
*  moving West into Europe. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=101.72s)]
*  We have an interest in preventing that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=103.8s)]
*  We have an interest in preventing a war in that region [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=105.8s)]
*  that could spread rapidly across the Black Sea, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  involve Turkey, involve Iran, we don't know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=111.24s)]
*  So we have an interest in doing that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  And we know that if we can prevent it, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=117.92s)]
*  we have to compromise. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=119.84s)]
*  And compromise is the way to ensure that Ukrainians, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  the majority of them who are Ukrainian, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  will live in a free and independent Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=128.36s)]
*  We're not doing any of those things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=130.72s)]
*  We're bent on some sort of revenge mission, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=132.72s)]
*  which makes no sense, to humiliate and harm Russia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=136.16s)]
*  Why is it beyond me? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=139.76s)]
*  This is not the Soviet Union. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=140.96s)]
*  This is Russia, a Russian state that rests [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  on the cross of Christianity. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=145.76s)]
*  It's back to what it has been for a thousand years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  We should celebrate that, not try to destroy it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=149.92s)]
*  Maybe that's one of the reasons [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=154.04s)]
*  we are trying to destroy it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=155.0s)]
*  Could be. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=157.76s)]
*  Could be. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=160.56s)]
*  Douglas McGregor, a wise man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  Wish you were in charge. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovshtDMDgD4&t=164.28s)]
