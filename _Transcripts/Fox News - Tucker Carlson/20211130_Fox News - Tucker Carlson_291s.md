# Enes Kanter Freedom changes name to celebrate first day as an American citizen
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc)
*  Ennis Cantor grew up in Turkey, came to this country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=0.0s)]
*  and wound up in the NBA. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=3.24s)]
*  Just a few hours ago, he became an American citizen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=4.84s)]
*  To mark the occasion, he has legally changed his name. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=7.24s)]
*  His new name is Ennis Cantor Freedom. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=10.48s)]
*  Ennis Cantor Freedom plays for the Boston Celtics, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=12.88s)]
*  and he joins us tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=15.68s)]
*  Ennis, Mr. Freedom, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=17.48s)]
*  Congratulations on becoming a citizen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Tell us why you've done this, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=22.28s)]
*  why you've become a citizen and changed your name. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=23.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Mr. Carlson. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  You know, I think I can just easily say [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  that this is the greatest day of my life. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  You know, it was my dream, the first day I stepped into America. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=32.76s)]
*  And, you know, after I got my green card, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=37.04s)]
*  obviously it's been a rough six years [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=39.64s)]
*  because Turkish government revoked my passport [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=41.32s)]
*  and put my name on the Interpol list. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=43.6s)]
*  But I think, you know, I wanted to do it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  because I remember the first time I came to America, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  you know, one of my teammates, it was back in 2009, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=52.2s)]
*  one of my teammates criticized the president [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=55.68s)]
*  and I turned around and I told him, I was like, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=58.8s)]
*  dude, what are you doing? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=60.64s)]
*  They're going to throw you in jail. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=62.0s)]
*  And he told me, he started laughing and said, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  this is America, don't worry about it, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=66.16s)]
*  you are not in Turkey anymore. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=68.16s)]
*  I was very shocked. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=69.92s)]
*  But, you know, the reason I wanted to do it [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=71.32s)]
*  because this, you know, from day one, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=73.56s)]
*  America gave me a home, American people opened their arms, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=75.52s)]
*  give me a warm welcome. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=79.16s)]
*  And I wanted to do it because I wanted to call somewhere [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=81.16s)]
*  where I can feel like this is my home now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=85.28s)]
*  And it is the greatest feeling I ever had. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=87.72s)]
*  Oh, that's just wonderful. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=91.68s)]
*  I wish we had so many more people like you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=93.8s)]
*  who are as grateful to be here as you clearly are. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=96.0s)]
*  How have your teammates responded? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=98.88s)]
*  Do you think they're as grateful to be Americans as you are? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=100.52s)]
*  I mean, my teammates actually, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=105.12s)]
*  were really happy for me because they knew the struggle [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=107.36s)]
*  that I had the last, you know, six years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=110.2s)]
*  You know, it was a funny joke in the beginning [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=113.12s)]
*  because they were calling me Mr. Freedom [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=115.6s)]
*  and now it became a reality. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=117.12s)]
*  But I think my teammates were like the one that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  you know, was like my brothers, you know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=123.36s)]
*  It was just so amazing because their support [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  gave me so much hope and motivation to fight [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=129.6s)]
*  and fight for what's right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=132.04s)]
*  So I definitely give a lot of credit to my teammates. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=133.36s)]
*  It seems like people who move here from countries [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=136.44s)]
*  that are not free appreciate the freedoms here much more [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=138.6s)]
*  than a lot of us who grew up with those freedoms. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=145.32s)]
*  You know, I feel like I'm gonna just say this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  and I'm gonna be honest, people should feel really blessed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=149.8s)]
*  and lucky to be in America because, you know, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=152.8s)]
*  they love to criticize it, but when you live a country [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=156.84s)]
*  like Turkey or, you know, China or somewhere else, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=160.72s)]
*  you will appreciate the freedoms you have here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=163.56s)]
*  Yes, that is exactly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=167.24s)]
*  So I feel like they should just, please, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=168.4s)]
*  they should just keep their mouth shut [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=171.32s)]
*  and stop criticizing the greatest nation in the world [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=172.52s)]
*  and they should focus on, you know, their freedoms [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=175.4s)]
*  and their human rights and their democracy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  So this is, America gave me everything I have. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  So I definitely appreciate the United States of America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=188.36s)]
*  We're putting up a picture of one of your sneakers [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  on the screen here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=191.08s)]
*  Tell us what this is. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  What's on there? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  I cannot see the picture right now, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=196.52s)]
*  but if you tell me what it is, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  I will tell you the story about it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=198.96s)]
*  It says, one says, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=201.24s)]
*  free something, my eyes are bad. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=203.8s)]
*  Oh, free the Uyghurs, stop genocide. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=206.4s)]
*  Stop genocide, rape and slave labor. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=211.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=214.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=215.56s)]
*  Well, obviously, you know, someone had to do it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=220.68s)]
*  There are so many athletes, so many actors, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=221.56s)]
*  so many celebrities out there who are scared [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  because if they criticize China, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  obviously they will be affected. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=230.72000000000003s)]
*  Their endorsement deals, their contract, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=232.72s)]
*  or their money will be affected, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=237.28s)]
*  and they're scared to say anything. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=239.32s)]
*  But to me, human rights, democracy and freedom [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=241.0s)]
*  is way more important than everything they can offer me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=244.88s)]
*  Morals, values and principles [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=248.72s)]
*  are the most important thing in life. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=250.72s)]
*  So to me, I wanted to stand up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=252.6s)]
*  for my Muslim brothers and sisters [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=254.76s)]
*  who are in concentration camps [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=256.32s)]
*  or getting tortured and raped every day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=259.32s)]
*  And I don't care who ever said which organization [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=261.56s)]
*  or which company, I don't care about any of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=264.0s)]
*  I care about the beauty of the voice [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=266.48s)]
*  of all those innocent people out there [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=268.04s)]
*  who don't have a voice. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=269.44s)]
*  If you have any siblings, tell them to come, please. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=272.2s)]
*  And it's freedom. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=275.44s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=276.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8MSTGSmTc&t=278.72s)]
