# Glenn Beck issues grave warning to America after Trump indictment
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg)
*  So when the history of cable news is written, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=0.0s)]
*  assuming anyone bothers to write it, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=3.24s)]
*  but if it ever is written, Glenn Beck will have his own chapter [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=4.96s)]
*  as possibly the greatest synthesizer of big ideas [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=8.72s)]
*  ever to appear on camera. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=13.68s)]
*  And a lot of people made fun of Glenn Beck [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=15.96s)]
*  over the years for that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=17.8s)]
*  But if you go back and watch the tape, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=18.68s)]
*  you will find out that maybe more than any other person [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=20.44s)]
*  on television, Glenn Beck got it right again and again [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=22.8s)]
*  and again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=27.48s)]
*  So we thought tonight is the perfect opportunity [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=28.68s)]
*  to hear from him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=31.12s)]
*  He's the co-founder of Blaze Media. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=31.96s)]
*  He's just written a book called The Great Reset. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=33.72s)]
*  And he joins us now for an overview of what we're watching. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=35.64s)]
*  Glenn Beck, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=38.52s)]
*  How would you interpret this? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=41.08s)]
*  Well, it's true. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=44.6s)]
*  So let me, I've got a couple of things here for you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=46.52s)]
*  Let me just go through. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm gonna bring, I think, a different perspective to this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=50.8s)]
*  We have the banking crisis. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=53.92s)]
*  They say it's fine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=55.22s)]
*  It's just beginning. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=56.24s)]
*  Yesterday, we had the Saudis and Brazil and China [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=58.6s)]
*  enter a deal to where the petrodollar is over. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=65.6s)]
*  Brazil and China are gonna trade in their own currency. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=69.28s)]
*  That's the beginning of the end of our currency. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=73.32s)]
*  That means a dollar collapse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=75.8s)]
*  That means we become Venezuela. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=77.32s)]
*  We will have war with China. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=79.8s)]
*  We will have war with Russia and Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=81.72s)]
*  We have the restrict bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=84.88s)]
*  We have social media and our NSA and everybody else [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=86.16s)]
*  in bed with each other, silencing people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  We, of course, have the raccoon dogs, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=92.56s)]
*  which we all know is bull crap. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  And now this week, we have a new gun grab [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  that they're trying to do. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Biden and his family taking money from the Chinese. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=103.12s)]
*  What do you think this Donald Trump thing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=106.96s)]
*  is really all about? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=108.52s)]
*  The American, the America that we knew, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=110.12s)]
*  the fundamental transformation that started in 2008 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=113.58s)]
*  is finished. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  We are no longer viewed as a superpower. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=118.56s)]
*  We are now an elderly, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=122.62s)]
*  what were Joe Biden just walking into the twilight. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=126.58s)]
*  What this is all about, I believe, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=130.66s)]
*  is trying to inflame this country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=133.14s)]
*  They've wanted violence from the right from the beginning. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=137.38s)]
*  They can't wait it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=141.26s)]
*  They need it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=142.82s)]
*  Because if we strike out, look at January 6th, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=144.16s)]
*  the day they're letting the shaman out of prison [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  because it was all trumped up, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=151.7s)]
*  thank you, Tucker Carlson, for revealing this, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  the day they're letting him out, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=157.12s)]
*  they do this to Donald Trump? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=159.7s)]
*  They want you to strike out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=162.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=164.24s)]
*  Because then they can close the cage. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna make another prediction for you, Tucker. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  You said I got it right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=170.42s)]
*  Well, everything I've been talking about since 08, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=171.82s)]
*  this is the time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=174.86s)]
*  I'm gonna make a prediction. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=176.94s)]
*  By 2025, we are going to be at war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=178.1s)]
*  We are going to have a new dollar, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=183.4s)]
*  a currency that probably is coming from the central bank, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=186.06s)]
*  we'll have a currency collapse, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=189.34s)]
*  and we will live in a virtual police state. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=191.98s)]
*  I know that might sound crazy to a lot of people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=195.62s)]
*  It's not far off. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=198.66s)]
*  The Bill of Rights is gone. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=202.06s)]
*  Nobody is paying attention. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=205.32s)]
*  Where are the Republicans? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  Where are the decent Democrats that can see [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=210.34s)]
*  this is insanity? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump, the reason why this is going to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=218.44s)]
*  help Donald Trump, and that's why I don't think [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=223.06s)]
*  they're doing it so he can't run. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=225.62s)]
*  They're doing it because they want people to strike out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=227.38s)]
*  Please turn to God, repent, pray for our country, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=230.18s)]
*  pray for peace, put on the full armor of God. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=234.5s)]
*  But here's what's really, what they miss. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=237.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is not even a person anymore. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=242.06s)]
*  He is a symbol. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  He is a symbol of the average everyday guy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=247.46s)]
*  that keeps getting screwed every single time, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=250.78s)]
*  watches other people screw up big banks, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=255.4s)]
*  screw up their companies, and get away with it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=259.02s)]
*  They see people all the time doing stuff [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=262.34s)]
*  that they know if they did, they'd be in prison [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=264.74s)]
*  for 20 years, but because they're not part of the elite, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=268.06s)]
*  they get away with it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump has taken arrow after arrow, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=273.46s)]
*  and that's why this is the way [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=276.78s)]
*  the average American feels tonight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=280.9s)]
*  I hope that there's a few Democrats out there, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=284.02s)]
*  but this guy has been taking the bullets [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=289.7s)]
*  for the average person now for years, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=291.66s)]
*  and people on the right feel like he's the only guy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=295.5s)]
*  that really gets what the people are feeling, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=299.3s)]
*  and it's not gonna end well for the Democrats [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=303.54s)]
*  in the next election. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=310.22s)]
*  I don't know if Donald Trump is the winner or not, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=311.66s)]
*  but I will tell you this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=314.82s)]
*  Donald, you're not going to stop 100 million people. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=316.58s)]
*  This country is in shambles, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=322.94s)]
*  and there's gonna be 100 million people [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=326.58s)]
*  that will walk on broken glass and through fire [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=328.54s)]
*  to vote for someone other than [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=331.5s)]
*  this corrupt Banana Republic administration. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=334.5s)]
*  That's, I think, exactly right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=339.74s)]
*  Glenn Beck, wow. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=341.5s)]
*  I'm gonna be processing that for a couple days. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=343.46s)]
*  I really appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=345.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr9hgxZiNg&t=346.78s)]
