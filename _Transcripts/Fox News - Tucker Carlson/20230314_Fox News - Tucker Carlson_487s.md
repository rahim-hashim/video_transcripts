# Tucker: This is where GOP 2024 hopefuls stand on Ukraine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU)
*  Last week, we sent a questionnaire to every Republican presidential candidate announced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=0.0s)]
*  in Potential asking about Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  We posed six questions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=6.72s)]
*  Is opposing Russia and Ukraine a vital strategic interest for America? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=8.92s)]
*  What's our objective in Ukraine and how are we going to know when we've achieved it? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=12.8s)]
*  What is the limit of money and weapons you'd be willing to send to Zelensky? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=16.2s)]
*  Have U.S. sanctions been effective and does the United States face the risk of nuclear [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=20.38s)]
*  war with Russia? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=24.76s)]
*  It was kind of presumptuous for a cable show to send these, but no one else in the media [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=25.76s)]
*  seemed to be asking them and we thought we should. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=29.48s)]
*  The first presidential primaries are 10 months away. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=32.72s)]
*  Voters should know where their candidates stand on the big issues and this in some ways [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=35.0s)]
*  is the biggest issue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=38.54s)]
*  So tonight we're happy to report that virtually everyone we asked responded. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=39.54s)]
*  Nikki Haley ignored us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=43.68s)]
*  John Bolton said he was too busy doing some unspecified thing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=44.96s)]
*  But most of the rest of them did get back to us and we are grateful that they did. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=48.32s)]
*  In general, the answers were fascinating. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=52.96s)]
*  Some of them were so thoughtful and so smart they give you hope for the Republican Party. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=55.08s)]
*  With only a few exceptions, their answers bore no resemblance at all to the statements [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=60.36s)]
*  you see every day from Mitch McConnell and various Republican committee chairmen in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=64.56s)]
*  Congress. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=67.84s)]
*  Republicans in Washington tend to be committed neocons in the Hillary Clinton mold. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=69.64s)]
*  But Republicans running for president this cycle generally are not at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=73.94s)]
*  That was a surprise, a refreshing surprise. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=78.62s)]
*  We had no idea. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=80.5s)]
*  We didn't know what to think. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=81.5s)]
*  So we're going to post every response that we got in full on our Twitter account tonight [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=82.92s)]
*  as a public record of where the candidates stand on Ukraine. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=86.52s)]
*  We hope you will look at them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=88.88s)]
*  But first, here's a quick summary of what we received. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=90.56s)]
*  So former President Donald Trump, who as of tonight is the front runner for the Republican [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=93.52s)]
*  nomination, sent a long and really interesting response. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=96.88s)]
*  Russia would never have attacked Ukraine if I were president, he writes, not even a small chance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=99.88s)]
*  Trump says he opposes regime change in Russia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=104.92s)]
*  Quote, we should support regime change in the United States. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  That's far more important. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=110.44s)]
*  The Biden administration are the ones who got us into this mess. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=111.74s)]
*  Trump repeatedly refers to the risk of nuclear war, which he describes as absolutely real. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  And then he calls for a negotiated peace by Ukraine mediated by the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=119.78s)]
*  Quote, both sides are weary and ready to make a deal, Trump writes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=124.38s)]
*  The meeting should start immediately. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  There is no time to spare. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=129.74s)]
*  Death and destruction must end now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=131.34s)]
*  Trump has been saying things like this and predicting this for five years now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=134.22s)]
*  And he's saying it again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=138.22s)]
*  What's interesting, though, is that Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, who was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=140.34s)]
*  also running for president this year, opposes his old boss on nearly every point. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=142.98s)]
*  We're paying Ukrainians to fight Russia, Pence writes, so we won't have to fight Russians ourselves. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=148.3s)]
*  Pence endorses even stricter sanctions against Moscow. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=153.7s)]
*  He dismisses the risk of nuclear war as a, quote, bullying tactic from Putin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=156.9s)]
*  And then Pence suggests that anyone who disagrees with his views on Ukraine is a disloyal American. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=161.4s)]
*  Quote, there is no room for Putin apologists in the Republican Party. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=166.22s)]
*  Mike Pence did not specify who he was talking about that we suspect this show is included [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=171.42s)]
*  in that treasonous category. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=175.06s)]
*  And then maybe the most newsworthy response that we received was from Florida Governor [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=177.9s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=181.26s)]
*  DeSantis has well-known views on many topics, of course, but until tonight, no one could [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=182.74s)]
*  really say with precision where he stood on the war in Ukraine, which is arguably the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=186.5s)]
*  most important topic in the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=190.78s)]
*  And now we know. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=192.9s)]
*  DeSantis is adamantly opposed to the position that most Republicans in Washington have taken [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=194.7s)]
*  on Ukraine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  DeSantis is not a neocon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=201.98s)]
*  Quote, while the U.S. has many vital national interests, DeSantis writes, securing our borders, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=202.98s)]
*  addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  independence and checking the economic, cultural and military power of the Chinese Communist [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=211.06s)]
*  Party, becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=214.94s)]
*  one of them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  Without question, he writes, peace should be the objective. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=223.18s)]
*  The U.S. should not provide assistance that could require the deployment of American troops [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  or enable Ukraine to engage in offensive operations beyond its borders. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  F-16s and long-range missiles should therefore be off the table. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  These moves would risk explicitly drawing the United States into the conflict and drawing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=240.34s)]
*  us closer to a hot war between the world's two largest nuclear powers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=244.3s)]
*  That risk is unacceptable. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=248.66s)]
*  DeSantis goes on to oppose the policy of regime change in Moscow, which is very popular in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=251.17999999999998s)]
*  Washington, and he points out that the Biden administration has created an alliance between [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=256.14s)]
*  Russia and China, and that's a disaster for the United States. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=260.3s)]
*  Quote, we cannot prioritize intervention in an escalating foreign war over the defense [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=263.58s)]
*  of our own homeland, especially as tens of thousands of Americans are dying every year [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  from narcotics smuggled across our open border and our weapons arsenals, critically for our [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=272.86s)]
*  own security, are rapidly being depleted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=277.74s)]
*  So that's DeSantis' position. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=281.46s)]
*  Clarified. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=284.82s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, meanwhile, who you just saw, who announced for president on this show a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  few weeks back, responded with what was effectively an essay. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=289.7s)]
*  It was so tightly argued and sharp it probably should be a Wall Street Journal piece. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=292.7s)]
*  We hope it becomes one. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=295.74s)]
*  We can't really do it justice here, but a few short excerpts give you the flavor. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  Quote, China wants the Ukraine war to last as long as possible to deplete Western military [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=300.34s)]
*  capacity before invading Taiwan. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=305.7s)]
*  It's working. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  We think we appear stronger by helping Ukraine, but actually become weaker vis-a-vis China. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=309.02s)]
*  We've spent 20 years droning people in caves in the Middle East and Central Asia and have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=314.54s)]
*  little to show for it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=318.46s)]
*  We should be taking out the people who have caused the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=320.2s)]
*  every year, the Mexican drug cartels. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=324.3s)]
*  If I were president right now, I wouldn't limit any further funding or support to Ukraine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=326.86s)]
*  Ukraine is not in the top five of American foreign policy priorities right now, and yet [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=332.02s)]
*  merely questioning whether the money we've spent on the war is being done effectively [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=336.26s)]
*  or perhaps even prolonging the war is seen as disloyal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=339.7s)]
*  We get accused by both Democrats and Republicans of being, quote, Putin sympathizers. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=342.98s)]
*  The Washington Unita Party and defense contractors want this conflict to go on forever. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  For the sake of the global economy and peace, we should be doing everything we can to end [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=351.62s)]
*  it tomorrow. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=355.42s)]
*  End quote. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=356.78s)]
*  Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota echoed some of these points. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  The primary external threat to the United States is communist China, she writes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=363.14s)]
*  And then she added another point that you rarely hear and not often enough. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  Quote. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=369.58s)]
*  The United States has come to rely far too heavily on financial sanctions as a weapon [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=370.58s)]
*  of deterrence. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=374.82s)]
*  Now the nations that hate America are consciously moving away from the US dollar as the world's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=376.34s)]
*  reserve currency. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=380.7s)]
*  Sanctions against China, Iran, and Russia have bolstered the Russian ruble and enabled [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  China to establish trade in Chinese money rather than in US dollars. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  That is true, provably true. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=391.32s)]
*  And you wonder why so few in Congress which passed these sanctions will acknowledge it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=393.92s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott, meanwhile, was not quite so bold or precise, but in spirit [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=399.44s)]
*  he seemed to agree with most of the rest of the Republican candidates. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=402.84s)]

*  President Biden's blank check foreign policy in Ukraine has diverted funding from essential [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=407.2s)]
*  needs in the United States. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=410.44s)]
*  Throwing money at Ukraine with no accountability or objective is clearly failing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=411.92s)]
*  End quote. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=416.36s)]
*  Once again, we had no idea the candidates felt this way until today and we're glad they [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=418.16s)]
*  do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=421.92s)]
*  Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, by the way, did not send a statement but instead [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=422.92s)]
*  a transcript from a hit he did on Trey Gowdy's weekend show here on Fox. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=426.2s)]
*  Not many details in it, but Scott did call for, quote, degrading the Russian military. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  He did not explain what the point of that might be. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=434.2s)]
*  And finally, Chris Christie is still around and still full of bombast. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=437.66s)]
*  Still a sporty character. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, if anything, Christie seems to become even more orthodox as a neocon. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  He calls on the U.S. military to fight and win a war against both Russia and China simultaneously. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=446.76s)]
*  Otherwise he warns Iran and North Korea could take over the world. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=452.36s)]
*  So that is where the Republican presidential candidates stand on Ukraine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=456.92s)]
*  But do not take our word for it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYWaTPwHTsU&t=460.59999999999997s)]
